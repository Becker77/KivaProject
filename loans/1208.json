He will be able to use the bull to plough the land and do other chores with the wagons and avoid these costs as that service is quite expensive.  He hopes to earn a great deal of profits with the purchase of the bull because he wants to have all the basics in his home so that his wife and son don\u2019t lack anything.  He wants to buy more dairy cattle for future production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1417734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a young bull for mating.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T01:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T01:40:11Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":440,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.27,"local_amount":38.4,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":39.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622363},{"amount":410.73,"local_amount":401.6,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":410.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818164}],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T01:07:28Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":598205,"name":"Tofiga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tofiga is a 38-year-old married woman with 5 children. \r\n\r\nShe has a small plantation and grows taro, banana, and vegetables in a garden to earn a living.

The family is currently living in a garage because their house roof and wall is so fragile. She has been mending shoes for a living for about 10 years. Even though her husband's leg is paralyzed, he helps his wife in many ways. Her daughter works at a land register company. As winter is approaching, she wants to renovate her old house because living in the garage in winter is impossible. So she is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as shingles, cement, bricks, planks, fiberglass and foam as well as vacuum insulated windows and hardwood flooring. By doing so, her family will live in a comfortable and warm place as no heat will seep though the walls again. More importantly, they will burn less coal for heating, thus releasing fewer pollutants into the air. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

Thanks to Kanykey's hard work, she has been able to develop and expand her business, and her activities bring in about 15,000 KGS per month, which is the main source of payment for her family's groceries and other everyday needs. \r\n\r\nProfits from Kanykey's business have allowed her to broaden her turnover of inventory. With the goal of further development of her business, Kanykey has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase wholesale food products for further resale. Profits from the loan will help Kanykey to increase turnover of inventory in her grocery store; revenue received will also help improve her family's

Mongolia. He has been rendering taxi service to the local people for eight months. Before this, he worked as a truck driver at a copper mine but he quit his job because his mother lived alone in Ulaanbaatar. Using his previous loan, he purchased and installed a heating system in his house. But it was not enough to protect them from the cold winter, and it consumed too much energy. Now he is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials, such as bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam in order to repair and insulate his wooden house. As a result, he and his mother will live in a comfortable and warm place where they won't need to burn a lot of coal for heating, which will have a positive impact on the environment as less pollutants will be released into the air.

He works all over the country so that he can feed and provide for the needs of his household, where he lives with his wife, who works as a housewife and cares for their five year old son.  Even though he has worked hard and made a great effort, Ivan has not been able to save up the money necessary to replace the roof on his home, so his family is affected whenever it rains.  He also wants to build a retention wall, since there are a number of dirt mounds that place his family at risk.  For this reason he is asking for a loan through FUSAI, to be able to have the money necessary to buy two and a half dozen sheets of metal and also to buy the materials needed to begin building the retention wall.  With this, Ivan will be able to provide his family with a better, more stable quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1417475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy sheet metal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iv\u00e1n Leonel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":38},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":41.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":41.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":47.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411737599}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T17:25:27Z","paid_date":"2013-10-25T08:42:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Ubadat has a secondary education. As the primary income earner for her family, Ubadat works raising livestock, something she began 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 7,000 KGS. Thanks to Ubadat's hard work, her farm currently has two head of big-horned cattle as well as 10 head of small-horned cattle, with monthly earnings at 10,000 KGS. With the goal of further expanding her farm, Ubadat has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to increase her head count by purchasing big-horned cattle. Profits from the loan will be invested into increasing her household's number of cattle, as well as improving her family's well-being.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1415253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

His father is an bookkeeper with a specialist education at the secondary level and his mother is a homemaker who helps her husband in the summertime with the upkeep of the farm. He is the oldest child in the family; one of his sisters is married and the other is still in school. Oyatullo has spent his whole childhood and youth in a village where the primary industry is breeding and raising cattle and in his free time from studies he tended cattle and helped his parents.\r\n\r\nOyatullo is a hardworking and conscientious young man. Though his parents didn't have the means to receive a higher education, they always dreamed that their son would be able to attend university, as he is very capable and did well in school with above-average grades. His parents' dream has partially come true, as Oyatullo has successfully passed all his entry exams and become a student of the Tajik State Commerce University. He has to pay his tuition but does not have the money. He is requesting a loan for US$800 to pay his tuition. He awaits your kindness. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1415262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He started the business by using a group loan from TLM in amount of IDR 500,000. He buys the product from the supplier then resells it at his house, and sometimes he sells it out in the villages. He usually buys the used clothes in the amount of IDR 200,000 per bag. Sometimes the clothes are damaged so he has to repair them using his sewing machine. The sewing machine is one of the outcomes of his success in this business. \r\n\r\nPetrus desires to renovate his house, but he lacks the money to do so. Therefore, he requested an individual loan from TLM in amount of IDR 4,500,000. The loan will be used to buy the materials he needs to renovate his house, such as cement, sand, woven fiber wall, etc., and as additional capital for his business. He hopes that his business will run well so he will be able to repay the loan to TLM.

the capital city of Mongolia. They all live in a small wooden house on a plot of land. She has been working as a cashier at a supermarket for two years. \r\n\r\nRecently, she and her husband began building a house next to their old house. But due to lack of finances, she can't afford to buy the necessary building materials such as bricks, cement, shingles, windows, doors and hardwood floors. If she finishes building her house before winter, her parents and her family can live in a comfortable and warm place respectively. Because all of them live in a small house, they are required to burn lots of coal for heating and release pollutants greatly, which has an adverse effect on the environment. Living in separate houses will create a comfortable and warm place. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1415033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She lives with her spouse and three children (1, 11 and 14 years old) in the town of Kutaisi. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Elza\u2019s husband, working at the local electric company. Elza is jobless at the moment.   She looks after her children and stays home, but she has a great desire to be involved in her own business.\r\n\r\n Elza couldn\u2019t receive a loan from the local financial institutions, because of their requirements to have business experience or stable revenue, until the Start Up program began which is a joint product of Kiva and Credo. The program allows vulnerable poor like Elza to get a chance for starting or re-starting a a business. \r\n\r\nElza requested a loan of 1000 USD to set up an indoor playground and party center for kids. Elza will rent the space, purchase playground equipment, hire children's entertainers and offer special party packages for children on their birthday. Elza hopes her business will be profitable, as there is not a similar center for kids nearby.\r\n\r\nThis will give her a chance to earn income and become financially independent.

He is a graphic designer from the Akhaltsikhe district. He is married and lives with his wife, mother-in-law and four children (1, 8, 9 and 11 years old). Imeda is the only one who makes money in his household. He has rented a place in his district and is actively involved in the graphic arts industry. Imeda works on special orders and creates visual concepts of furniture, billboards, cars, architecture, etc., using computer software.  \r\n\r\nHe works hard and the business is going well, but his earnings are not enough for such a large family. For this reason, Imeda decided to diversify the business and requested credit from MFO Credo to purchase souvenirs and jewelry for selling.

He lives with his two children at his sister\u2019s house and has been working as a farmer for 34 years.  He checks his farmland daily.  His wife is his main source of encouragement and mainly raises potatoes, wheat, barley, and quinoa.  He also raises poultry.  His main income comes from his raising of grains, which he continually increases.  Many times this work is very exhausting for him and his family, but it allows them to cover their expenses, and he has food available.

This way she has been able to help her husband carry their financial burden. \r\n\r\nThis client is a hard working and judicious woman, whose enterprising spirit motivates her to look for options to continue moving forward. That is why she is requesting this loan, so that she can invest in purchasing wholesale merchandise (fragrances, cosmetics, accessories, lingerie, body lotions, and other items) and make the most of the sales and discounts that lower the cost of products. This will allow her to have a wider variety of items to satisfy the needs and tastes of her customers. She will also increase the profit margin from her sales. \r\n\r\nThis way Mary will be able to take another step towards achieving her goals, particularly towards becoming sales director for the brand of products she sells. This will create an opportunity for her to obtain higher income so that she can give her children an excellent higher education and improve her whole family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1418027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale merchandise (fragrances, cosmetics, accessories, lingerie, body lotions, and other items).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164173},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168702},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173356},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178139},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183053},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188103},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193292},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198624},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204104},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209734},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215520},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221466},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227575},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233854},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240305}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":147613,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":148460.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807437},{"amount":178.85,"local_amount":340664,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":342620.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074583},{"amount":93.13,"local_amount":177397,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":178415.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009778},{"amount":204.67,"local_amount":389852,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:50:46Z","rounded_local_amount":392090.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523376},{"amount":1020.85,"local_amount":1944474,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1955640.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227112}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T16:13:39Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T09:58:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":598381,"name":"Wang'ae Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Protas, who is in his early 30s, is married and has two children, who are in school.

is 36 years old, married and living in the village of Dzimiti with her husband and school-aged daughter. The family runs a small-scale agricultural business for seasonal income. Specifically, they cultivate the plot of land where maize and nuts are grown. The harvest is sold at the local market. \r\n\r\nBesides this, Guliko runs a dairy farm with a cow for milk. She produces dairy products with the milk and sells them from her house. As their existing income is very small and is not enough to cover everyday expenses, Guliko decided to start a clothing sales business. She requested a loan from the local credit providers, but they usually demand some stable income from the borrowers. Guliko\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she didn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. She received this credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With this loan of 2,000 GEL she will purchase clothing and household items at wholesale prices and sell them in her community door-to-door.

Today he is 32 years old and works in the same square for a fast food business. He alternates this job with selling merchandise like t-shirts, jeans, tennis shoes, and other items. This allows him to obtain the income he needs to cover expenses and basic needs for his family, which includes his wife and their two daughters, who are six and nine years old. \r\n\r\nLuis is a vigorous, hard working, judicious, and enterprising man. He always tries to make the most of the opportunities life brings him, which is why he decided to request a loan to invest in purchasing wholesale merchandise (blouses, jeans, t-shirts, tennis shoes, and clothing in general for men, women, and children). His goal is to make the most of the discounts he receives for making cash purchases. This will allow him to have a wider variety of items to satisfy his customers' needs and tastes. He will also be able to expand his market, because he is already familiar with the whole market square, which is full of potential customers. This will result in an icrease of sales and, in turn, an increase in his income. \r\n\r\nThis will allow Luis to give his daughters a good education and to save money to set up his own business in a commercial space and generate enough income to offer his family a better quality of life in the near future."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1418039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale merchandise (blouses, jeans, tennis shoes, and clothing in general for men, women, and children).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Arley ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71847},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73829},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75866},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77959},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80109},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82319},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84590},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86924},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89322},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91786},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94318},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96920},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99593},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102341},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105164},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108065},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111047},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114110},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117258},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120493},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123817},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127233},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130743},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134347}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":598403,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is originally from the city of Accra-Teshie.

The problem she\u2019s faced with is small capital. \r\nShe started this business by selling for her mother on a table market and learned this from friends. What she likes about this business is that she meets new people and makes profit every day; it makes her proud to have money in her home every day. She spends eight hours on her business every day, and uses the bus to get her goods from the wholesale center. In future she wants to open another shop in the next

He is a market vendor and sells seasonal fruits and vegetables in his place in a central bazaar and from his home. Baxtiyar has 10 years of experience in this field. He knows customers' needs and he has reliable providers. \r\n\r\nHe chose this business because it is profitable and brings stable income. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy, and many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma.

She is 28 years old and has a common-law marriage, through which she has two children, ages 5 years and 2 years.  The older one goes to school.  Her husband is a businessman.  \r\n\r\nAndrea, to earn something on her own and to help with household expenses, makes her living selling all types of clothing.  She sells door-to-door and also from her house, where her most familiar customers come.  She works everyday from 8:00 until 11:00, making the most of this time that her son is at school and she only has to take along the younger one.  She sells to her customers on credit and collects once a week.\r\n\r\nShe goes to Guayaquil to buy her merchandise whenever she needs to.  She has had this business for more than 5 years, and it gives her a good income.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy more merchandise, like:  pants, blouses and t-shirts.

He currently makes his living working as a construction worker, which he alternates with milk production and sales, since he independently owns 8 dairy cows.  He sells the milk he gets to a dairy business in the municipality where he lives, and in this way, he gets the necessary income to bring home the daily bread.\r\n\r\nThe borrower is a hardworking man with an enterprising spirit, which motivates him to continue striving and to achieve the goals he sets for himself.  He has overcome many obstacles, especially because of the low prices for milk sales, due to the oversupply in the market. In addition to this, he has been affected by government importations.  \r\n\r\nThis is motivating him to apply for a loan that he will invest in the purchase of livestock to raise (12 calves) and to pay off the loan that he has outstanding.  With this, he will be able to expand his production, not only of milk, but he will also complement it by breaking into the beef market.  This way he will be able to continue his business and increase his earnings in order to continue moving towards meeting his goals.  He will also be able to offer his family a better quality of

He will use the supplies to cultivate his crops and increase his crop yields, which will allow him sell his crops at a better price at market. That way he can keep working and in the near future expand his crops, generating higher earnings and offering his family economic stability and a better quality of

Currently and for the last 7 years, he has been growing peppers, corn and onions which he sells in order to provide for his family - a wife and teenage son. John also works as a butler on a ranch to earn extra money. He is industrious and works long days, overcoming various obstacles such as the changing climate and the effect it has on his plants, but he always moves forward with his dream of expanding and diversifying his crops, which will enable him to offer work to other members of his community. It is for this reason he is asking for a loan, which he will invest in buying wholesale agricultural supplies (fertilisers, irrigation equipment and seeds). These will help him continue with his work and obtain a better quality harvest, thereby increasing his earnings. In this way, John hopes to be able to improve his family's wellbeing and economic stability."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1418298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Salamtkhan is the primary income earner for her family through her work raising animals and crops. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now includes eight milking cows and 20 sheep as well as 1.5 hectares of land on which she grows corn. Her monthly profits amount to 8,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her farm, Salamtkhan has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to increase her head count of livestock by purchasing two big-horned cattle.

More than 25 years ago, Zamira started a business raising cattle to supplement her income. With just 4,000 KGS in starting capital she was able to build up to having four milk cows and 30 sheep on her farm. Zamira has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a 100,000 KGS loan to purchase more cattle for further development of her business.

mother-hero.  She and her husband are raising 11 children.  Umut has a secondary-specialized education.  She graduated from a co-operative college in 1972.  She worked as a salesperson at various organizations from 1972-1993.  Her husband and she decided to get involved in animal husbandry and farming in 1993.  The spouses have an optimistic outlook and progress in life.  They know precisely what they want and achieve everything with their own efforts, and also know how to correctly use and plan financial means for achieving set goals.  They started this business with 1,000 som (KGS).  They have a lot of experience in breeding and keeping livestock and in farming.  Thanks to Umut's and her large and friendly family's hard work, their business now contains two dairy cows, two horses, one mare, four calves, forty sheep, thirty lambs, and also a 1.5 hectare land plot, where they annually grow potatoes and corn.  Her business yields about 30,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as a basis for covering expenses for food and basic needs of the large family.  In order to further develop her business, Umut requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1415980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karazhygach village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":171.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":365.85,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":18125.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8,"payment_id":459019523},{"amount":373.84,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":18125.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749435},{"amount":369.65,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":18125.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.2,"payment_id":529946798},{"amount":346.15,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":18125.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.69,"payment_id":579488608},{"amount":1072.62,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":58404.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":132,"payment_id":595435852}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T20:21:14Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":599516,"name":"Ramiriza Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"D\u00e9nise  fait partie du groupe  Ramiriza et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

With the support from this loan, Paola plans to purchase ingredients to stock her food business, including rice, meat, oil, condiments, soft drinks, plastic silverware and cooking utensils.

His wife works as a teacher at the local school and gets a small monthly salary.\r\n\r\nAleksandre works hard in his plot of land, but his income is seasonal and the family needs a monthly source to cover food and everyday expenses.

He owns a mini-bus and wishes to work on a line, but there are no seats in his car, as Aleksandre used to work transport service with it. \r\n\r\nAll of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Aleksandre applied for the credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva. This program enables the vulnerable poor to start or restart businesses. A loan of $2,200 will help him to purchase and install seats and arrange the car interior suitably. Once the minibus is rearranged, he will work on the minibus line and transport the passengers from one district to another. This business initiative will generate an income. With the increased income, he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family members.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1415329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to install the seats in his minibus for working on the line.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tsinandali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aleksandre ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":135.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":137.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":146.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.49},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":163.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.49},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":598492,"name":"Nduni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nduni is a 36-year-old married woman.

","en":"Leticia, 48 years old, is married and the mother of three children. Thirteen years ago she began to be involved in the world of sewing. She began by working in a small workshop near her home where she obtained her first experience. Later she had the opportunity to work for a much larger business at a much higher salary. There she learned new techniques and perfected her knowledge. Taking advantage of the experience she had acquired and a loan that had been approved for her, she decided to become independent and opened her own workshop where she sews for third parties; for this, she relies on help from her oldest daughter and two employees. In this way she has generated the earnings necessary to help her husband with household expenses.\r\n\r\nLeticia states that she greatly enjoys her work although at times she needs to confront challenges that can delay production. For examples she needs to obtain skilled workers who do good finishing work since it is upon such skills that the continuation of  contracts from her customers depends. Nevertheless, she has known how to get ahead.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is requesting a loan in order to purchase two flat sewing machines that she needs to streamline production and to be able to finish the orders she has received in a timely manner. This will enable her to open her doors to accept more contracts. In the future, in the medium term, she dreams of producing her own line, expanding her workshop and generating more employment opportunities for mothers who are heads of households. This will not only increase her own family\u2019s quality of life but that of many other persons who influence her business.

She lives in a rural area which offers ideal conditions to develop her animal husbandry business.  She fattens livestock at home.  She currently owns four cows and two sheep.  She wakes up early in the morning and starts her day by milking her cows.  She sells her cows' milk and kefir (fermented milk drink) to her neighbors.  After a few months she also resells the livestock which she has fattened.  \r\n\r\nNazrijon is continuing to support her children as they are becoming adults.  She wants to hold a wedding ceremony for her youngest child, who is now 21 years old, but she doesn't have the money to do so.  She is requesting a loan of 7,500 somoni to pay for the wedding party.

Miguel's job is selling bananas, yuca, and other products from his crops.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he didn't have a stable job, so he didn't have enough money for his household.  This is why he decided to start a new project 12 years ago, with a desire to get ahead.  He thought his friends, neighbors, or relatives would want to buy products from his fields, depending on the season.  This is how he started his business, which gives him very good results now.\r\n\r\nHe likes what he does because it allows him to have time to be able to take care of his house.

He is the father of two children and lives in free union with his partner. Eighteen years ago he moved from the town where he was born and settled in the city, with the goal of seeking new horizons and new opportunities to progress. There he began to work in a business, but after four years, he saw that the salary he earned was not sufficient to pay for the necessities of his household. For that reason, he began to sell fruit from a cart on Sundays. Little by little, he acquired customers, and it began to go better for him, and so he decided to resign from the business and sell fruit full time. Further on, he acquired a fixed location where he could locate his cart, and he has been there for 14 years, working every day from very early in the morning and during the day. He has the help of his older son. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is a hard-working and vigorous man. He focuses on reaching his goals, and for this reason he was encouraged to apply for the loan, with the goal of investing in the wholesale purchase of fruits to take advantage of the discounts he obtains and thus capitalize his business, which will be reflected in an increase in the earnings margin for his sales. This will allow John to accomplish his dream of offering his children an excellent university education, so that they can have a successful future and become good men. Furthermore, he wants to set up a fruit and vegetable business at a place located in a large residential neighborhood. Thus he will have the potential to offer his family a stable, favorable economy and a better quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1418337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruit wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Antonio de Prado","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John Jairo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96022},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98671},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101393},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104190},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107065},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110018},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113053},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116172},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119377},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122670},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126054},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129532},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133105},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136777},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140551},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144428},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148412},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152510}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.71},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":598525,"name":"Boneconcil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Boneconcil is a widow with five children that she is looking after. \r\n\r\nShe is a farmer, who also deals in the making of the local brew, and she is requesting UGX 1,000,000 to assist her in starting another produce business to get another source of income to educate her children.

He decided to start his own business out of a need to have a trade to generate his own income and because there were times when the couple\u2019s income was not sufficient and because he wanted to provide a better quality of life for his children.  Therefore, seeing the good results he is having, he wants to continue with his business and begin selling food products by setting up a store in his home.  This will be his first Kiva loan and he is grateful for the financial support.  In this way he can move ahead with his plans.  He will use the 1,500 Soles to buy compost, seeds, and seedlings, while looking for comfortable prices so he can have good profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1417275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Aucayacu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":173.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":177.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":187.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":191.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":198.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":212.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.29,"local_amount":150.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":155.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353675},{"amount":63.79,"local_amount":173.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":179.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905437},{"amount":430.92,"local_amount":1175.25,"processed_date":"2014-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-02T12:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1212.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504306738}],"funded_date":"2013-09-13T00:49:06Z","paid_date":"2015-09-02T12:13:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Tetelkhunti is a remotely located rural village. The lady standing third from right with her hand raised in the photograph is Manjulata. She belongs to a poor family and is a very active and energetic lady. She lives with her husband, one son who is eight years old and one daughter who is five years old.  Manjulata has been running a general store in her village for the last two years. She started her small business in a wooden stall with 4,000 INR of her own. In the year 2011, she and five members of her village formed a group named Thakurani to avail loans from Mahashakti foundation. She has already taken the first loan and has been able to give a new look to her shop by increasing the stock. She sells general grocery items like oil, sugar, tea, soap, washing powder, lentils, biscuits, toffees, eggs, etc. Her husband is a mason who always used to move outside for his work. So Manjulata manages her house as well as the business. Her net monthly income from the existing business is 4,000 INR. Out of this income, she barely manages her business as well as her household expenses. Manjulata purchases stock for her business on a weekly basis from the wholesalers in the nearest town, which is 15 kms away.  She wants to increase her stock with this second loan of 14,000 INR by purchasing items like lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc. Manjulata hopes this will help her to increase her income and realize her dreams by constructing a permanent cabin for her business and providing a better education for her children.\r\n\r\nThe other five borrowers in the group are Surudei, Nilendri, Minakhi, Banti and Binodini, who have a puffed rice business, a fish vending business, a tailoring center, a fast food center and a vegetable vending business, respectively\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1415450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase oil, sugar, tea dust, washing powder, lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TETELKHUNTI, BALANGIR,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Surudei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilendri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manjulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minakhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binodini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-14T19:38:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":599657,"name":"Jesus-Kpego Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement JESUS-KPEGO est compos\u00e9 de neuf membres qui vivent  dans le m\u00eame village.

Among the four members, two are old members who have already taken their first loan from Mahashakti in 2011 and two members are new. Kakaya, about 48 years old, is one of the members. The lady standing on the extreme right in the photo, raising her hand, is Kakaya. She is one of the old members of Mahashakti Foundation. She lives with her husband and her three sons aged 19, 15 and 13 years old. All her children are continuing their studies in the local college and school.\r\n\r\nKakaya has been running a general store in her locality for the last 15 years with the help of her husband. She sells general grocery items like rice, oil, sugar, tea, soap, washing powder, lentils, biscuits, soft drinks, toffees, eggs, etc. All types of daily need items are available in her store. Her husband is a very amicable person. He is always cheerful with the customers.  Her net monthly income from the existing business is Rs.10,000. Out of this income, she has been able to contribute to the household expenses like the educational expenses of her children. Kakaya purchases stock for her business on a weekly basis from the wholesalers in her town. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase the stock in her business with this loan by purchasing items like lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc. for her general store from the nearest wholesale market, which is 200 kms away. This will help her to reduce her purchasing costs and save time as she has to refill her stock frequently. Kakaya dreams of providing a better education to her children as she believes that education is the pillar of all success. The other three members of the group are Malati, Basanti and Ratna. They are running a Tiffin stall, a bamboo basket making and selling business and a tailoring business, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1415467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, eggs etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kakaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ratna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":48000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-30T19:59:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":600442,"name":"Shirly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Shirly de 28 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica  a la elaboraci\u00f3n y ventas de bolsos sint\u00e9ticos, desde hace 10 a\u00f1os.
