They live in an old house on a plot of land. Her elder son lives separately from her as he got married. Her younger son is a third year student at university and is currently working at a furniture making facility as an assistant. She herself has been working as a cook at a cafeteria for two years. She is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as shingles and fiberglass. \r\n\r\nThe house roof has become so vulnerable it doesn't protect from rain drops or snow. After renovation she, together with her son, will live in a comfortable and warm place. They will also burn less coal for heating, thus releasing less pollutants and contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

escuela primaria ha podido trabajar como comerciante en varias \u00e1reas, est\u00e1 casado con Elvia de 37 a\u00f1os quien se dedica a los quehaceres del hogar y cuidado de sus 3 hijos que se encuentran estudiando en la escuela fiscal de la ciudad donde viven: Salcedo, ubicado en la parte Oriente de Cotopaxi una de las provincias m\u00e1s importantes de la Sierra ecuatoriana. \nUna ciudad ideal para actividades de comercio por el paso de turistas en la ciudad y las necesidades de sus habitantes. A pesar de estas actividades productivas que se desarrollan como la agricultura y ganader\u00eda, hay \u00edndices muy preocupantes de analfabetismo y de pobreza por necesidades b\u00e1sicas insatisfechas como por ejemplo el servicio de alcantarillado que solo lo tienen el 25% de los hogares pero en lo cual las autoridades locales se encuentran trabajando para resolver este tipo de necesidades en cada hogar.\nMientras tanto, sus habitantes buscan la manera de llevar el sustento a sus hogares a pesar de la falta de empleo, es el caso de Fernando quien desde hace 20 a\u00f1os estableci\u00f3 su propio taller de pintura y enderezada de veh\u00edculos, actividad que la desarroll\u00f3 desde ni\u00f1o con la ayuda e instrucci\u00f3n de su hermano mayor y ahora la realiza independientemente dedicando entre 8 y 10 horas cada d\u00eda para  entregar a sus clientes un acabado perfecto y puntual en los trabajos que le son encomendados. Hace 2 a\u00f1os Fernando sufri\u00f3 un asalto en su negocio que le gener\u00f3 mucha p\u00e9rdida por el material y herramientas que los delincuentes se llevaron, sin embargo pensando en su familia, Fernando no se dio por vencido y poco a poco se ha recuperado laboral, emocional y econ\u00f3micamente, por lo cual ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo que lo usar\u00e1 en la compra de pintura y materiales que le ayuden a mejorar su trabajo y adem\u00e1s a obtener un ahorro por el descuento que sus proveedores le otorgan por compra al por mayor y pago de contado. Con este abastecimiento de material Fernando podr\u00e1 recibir m\u00e1s pedidos de trabajos y entregar a tiempo para que as\u00ed sus clientes lo recomienden y pueda generar mayores ingresos que le ayudar\u00e1n a brindar a su familia un mejor estilo de vida. \nLa falta de capital dej\u00f3 de ser un problema desde que Fernando lleg\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde confiaron en \u00e9l y en sus proyectos y a trav\u00e9s del producto Kiva le pudieron dar la oportunidad de acceder a un cr\u00e9dito, por lo cual \u00e9l anima a los inversionistas a continuar apoyando a los emprendedores principalmente de su pa\u00eds.","en":"Fernando is 40 year old man. With the knowledge he acquired at primary school he has been able to work as a merchant in many areas. He is married to Elvia, who is 37 years old. She does the housework and cares for their 3 children who are in public school in the city where they live, Salcedo. It is located in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces in the Ecuadorian sierra. It is an ideal city for merchant activities because of the tourists that go through the city and its residents' needs. In addition to productive activities such as farming and cattle raising, there are worrying rates of illiteracy and poverty due to unsatisfied basic needs, for example a sewage system, which only 25% of the homes have, but which local authorities are working on to resolve. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, its residents seek to support their homes despite a lack of employment, as is the case of Fernando. Twenty years ago he set up his own vehicle painting and bodywork workshop, an activity he developed as a child with the help and instruction of his older brother. Now he does it on his own, working between 8 and 10 hours a day to deliver to his customers a perfect finish on time. Two years ago, Fernando underwent an armed robbery at his business which caused a lot of loss due to the materials and tools that the assailants took. Nonetheless, thinking of his family, Fernando didn't give up and little by little he has recovered professionally, emotionally and financially. Now he needs a loan that he will use to buy paint and materials that will help him to improve his work and get some savings from the discount his suppliers will give him for buying in bulk and paying up front. By stocking these materials, Fernando can take on more work orders and deliver on time because his customers will recommend him and he can generate more income that will help him offer his family a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe lack of capital stopped being a problem since Fernando came to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, where they trusted him and his projects. Through Kiva, they were able to give him an opportunity of accessing a loan. Because of this, he encourages the investors to keep supporting entrepreneurs, especially in his country."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1418616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to invest in paint and materials for vehicle bodywork.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodrigo Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":787.85,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":65.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":75.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":76.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":78.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":82.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":83.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":85.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":87.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":141.48,"local_amount":139.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":141.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320663},{"amount":67.51,"local_amount":66.48,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":67.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856350},{"amount":275.14,"local_amount":270.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":275.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059929},{"amount":143.97,"local_amount":141.78,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":143.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212231},{"amount":88.05,"local_amount":86.71,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":88.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138234},{"amount":83.85,"local_amount":82.59,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832248}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T15:40:47Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":600475,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Reynaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 es originario de la perla del Septentri\u00f3n Matagalpa ubicada geogr\u00e1ficamente en el noroeste de Nicaragua una ciudad muy linda altamente productora de caf\u00e9, estado civil de Jos\u00e9 es acompa\u00f1ado el n\u00facleo familiar est\u00e1 compuesto por su c\u00f3nyuge, tres hijos y su mam\u00e1 , este var\u00f3n se caracteriza por ser una persona trabajadora y comprometido con su familia.\n\nCon los cr\u00e9ditos obtenidos anteriormente manifiesta que han sido de gran importancia ya que ha resuelto algunos problemas en su familia.\nJos\u00e9 se desempe\u00f1a como fontanero de una empresa de servicio de acueducto y alcantarillado su funci\u00f3n es brindarle mantenimiento a todas las tuber\u00edas potables e instalar servicio nuevo.\n\nCon el monto financiado lo va destinar para la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n tales como ladrillo, arena, cemento y pago de mano de obra por el mejoramiento de su vivienda.\n\nManifiesta su entusiasmo y agradecimiento a kiva por este tipo de apoyo ya que es una manera que las familias pobre puedan mejora sus viviendas.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is from Perla del Septentri\u00f3n Matagalpa, located in north eastern Nicaragua, It is a very pretty city which produces a lot of coffee.

Also he will pay people to help him work on his crops as he plants 10,500 square meters of corn, 3,500 of corn and 3,500 of vegetables such as tomatoes, green beans, chilies, and cucumbers.\r\n\r\nErasmo's idea is to increase the amount of products he sells as well as reduce the cost of producing them and the transportation costs. In the future he would like to farm more land and receive a higher margin of profit from his products. He would like to see that his efforts are rewarded, his harvests abundant and that his grandchildren learn his trade. This can provide them a way to earn their living when they have their own families.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1418705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, herbicide, and pay workers to help grow his corn, bean and vegetable crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erasmo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":264.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":298.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":336.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":264.65,"local_amount":264.65,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":264.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216615},{"amount":635.35,"local_amount":635.35,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":635.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818166}],"funded_date":"2013-09-27T12:33:36Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":598655,"name":"Jorge Humberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Tal vez muchas personas se preguntan, \u00bfporqu\u00e9 un hombre quiere estudiar cosmetolog\u00eda y est\u00e9tica?

Ahora bien, cuando analizo y encontr\u00f3 esa respuesta sinti\u00f3 paz en su interior para poderla empezar a desarrollar, quieren saber \u00bfcu\u00e1l fue la respuesta que el encontr\u00f3?, f\u00e1cil, estudiar ESTETICA, ayuda a ayudar a otras personas que desean estar a la vanguardia que el mundo nos ofrece en el d\u00eda a d\u00eda y porque no, desarrollar esta profesi\u00f3n en pos de un negocio lucrativo y novedoso.\nJorge es un joven t\u00e9cnico en Sistemas que labora en el \u00e1rea social dentro de una Iglesia y ha podido ver la necesidad del hombre en diferentes \u00e1mbitos, es all\u00ed cuando ha podido entablar una entrevista con mujeres y hombres que desean superarse siempre ve ciertos limitantes, ya que la belleza y est\u00e9tica en nuestro pa\u00eds son temas que van de la mano con el desarrollo profesional, lastimosamente no deber\u00eda ser as\u00ed, pero es la realidad que se est\u00e1 viviendo.\nJorge en el a\u00f1o 2011 inicia la b\u00fasqueda junto con un grupo de compa\u00f1eros de su misma actividad laboral, como crear  maneras diversas de ayudar a las personas que lo necesitan, all\u00ed se les ocurri\u00f3 la idea de iniciar estudios en el \u00e1rea de la psicolog\u00eda y se encontr\u00f3 con un mundo de dimensiones que rige al hombre, ejemplo SALUD-BIENESTAR-FELICIDAD. Poco a poco fue conociendo personas que lo empezaron a impulsar a estudiar no s\u00f3lo psicolog\u00eda sino una carrera que tuviera fines en el campo de la salud y la belleza.\nAhora bien, cuando Jorge piensa en la actividad de la est\u00e9tica no solo piensa en el embellecer sino por medio del internet se dio cuenta que por medio de los equipos el\u00e9ctricos de la est\u00e9tica puede tratar inclusive pacientes en estado \u201cvegetal\u201d d\u00e1ndoles as\u00ed bienestar y manejo de los m\u00fasculos para evitar escaras y\/o ulceras, es decir no solo se une belleza y arte sino tambi\u00e9n salud a esta profesi\u00f3n, porque no ingresar a un mercado laboral o crear una empresa que sea en pro de la belleza y salud integral.\nBien ahora viendo la cantidad de oferta acad\u00e9mica Jorge elije estudiar esta carrera en CAMPO ALTO, por su desempe\u00f1o acad\u00e9mico y la experiencia que tiene a nivel formal en el \u00e1rea t\u00e9cnicos en salud, solo resta desearle tanto a Jorge, sus futuros compa\u00f1eros y a CAMPO ALTO, bendiciones espirituales, celestiales y materiales.\n","en":"Perhaps a lot of people are wondering, why does a guy want to study cosmetology and beauty? Well, Jorge always had this question in his mind, trying to find an answer to this great mystery that many people don't understand. Now, after analyzing the question and finding his answer, he felt peace inside and is able to begin to grow. People want to know what was the answer that he found - easy, to study beauty, to help other people who want to be on the cutting edge of what the world offers day to day, and to develop this profession into a lucrative and novel business. \r\n\r\nJorge is a young systems technician who works in social activities at a church and has been able to see men's needs in different areas. It's there where he began to interview women and men who want to better themselves, but always seeing certain limitations since beauty and aesthetics in his country are topics that go hand in hand with professional development; it shouldn't be this way, but that is the reality in which he lives. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Jorge began the search, together with a group of friends from work, for how to create diverse ways to help people in need. Through this he got the idea to begin studying psychology and discovered a world of dimensions that control men, such as health, wellbeing, happiness. Little by little he got to know people who began to urge him to study not psychology, but a career that was part of the health and beauty field. \r\n\r\nNow when Jorge thinks about aesthetics he doesn't just think about beautification, but through the internet he realized that with electric technology aesthetics can treat even patients with brain damage, improving their wellbeing and maintaining their muscles to avoid bedsores and\/or ulcers. That is to say that it is not just beauty and art that are connected, but health is also a part of the profession, so why not become part of a labor market or create a business in beauty and integrative health. \r\n\r\nHaving seen the quantity of academic options, Jorge chose to study this career in Campo Alto. Thanks to his academic dedication and experience in technical aspects of health, all that remains is to wish for Jorge, his future colleagues and Campo Alto, spiritual, celestial and material blessings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1415617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to attend his first semester of cosmetology and holistic beauty school in Campoalto.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.82,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":66935.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780605},{"amount":340.18,"local_amount":635000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":653906.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845814}],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T21:52:06Z","paid_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":598865,"name":"Macaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Macaria raises pigs for a living.

Bogor has all the problems third world cities have: including a lack of access to safe and affordable drinking. \n\nMr Al-Aziz is becoming well known in his city and he has started selling to schools, mosques and Islamic education centres.  Mr Al-Aziz: \u201cUsing the previous KIVA loan I was able to get new clients and increase my visibility\u201c. He is now selling through 3 direct sales kiosks that he rents or shares with others. Besides he has a network of 3 sub agents that buy from him. Besides drinking water filters, Al-Aziz also sells Nazava water filters that make very murky and stinky water clear so that it can be used for washing. \u201cEverybody has a different source of water here, so I need large amount of stock in order to be able to satisfy everybody\u201d, says Al-Aziz. \n\nWith help of KIVA credit Mr. Aziz can have a greater stock with a larger variety of filters which means that he can help a larger number of households with their pressing drinking water problems. By supporting Mr. Al-Aziz, not only his business will be strengthened. More families will have access to safe and affordable drinking water and these families will also save money and increase their disposable income. The Reseller Support Team from Nazava will do a couple of joint promotions in the coming months. Besides Aziz will place advertisements in local news papers and will also try to advertise Nazava through the local radio stations. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1419138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to further expand the sales of drinking water filters","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.589722 106.791389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Al-Aziz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":20000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4000000},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4000000},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4000000},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4000000},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":355},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":355},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":355},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":355},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":355,"local_amount":4000000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4040867.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419915998},{"amount":355,"local_amount":4000000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4040867.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440031989},{"amount":710,"local_amount":8000000,"processed_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-01T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8081734.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449685993},{"amount":355,"local_amount":4000000,"processed_date":"2014-06-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-21T09:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4040867.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490886280}],"funded_date":"2013-08-29T21:31:09Z","paid_date":"2014-08-21T09:17:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":598855,"name":"Oyunaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oyunaa is 51 years old, lives with her husband and has five children in \"Ger\" (a traditional nomadic tent) in the Uvs province of Mongolia.

separada. Hace 19 a\u00f1os se dedica a la confecci\u00f3n, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 emp\u00edricamente; trabaj\u00f3 como operaria en varios talleres, donde perfeccion\u00f3 su t\u00e9cnica y obtuvo m\u00e1s conocimientos del oficio. Toda esta experiencia y conocimientos adquiridos, le permitieron iniciar su propio negocio, un taller que ubic\u00f3 en su casa, donde comenz\u00f3 a confeccionar su l\u00ednea propia de pijamas y blusas para dama y conjuntos deportivos. Silvia ha tenido que enfrentar varios inconvenientes, pues en la zona donde se encuentra ubicada, existen bandas criminales que est\u00e1n pendientes de la actividad de los comerciantes para cobrar vacunas y extorsiones, por lo que tuvo que prescindir de las empleadas que le ayudaban y bajar el ritmo de producci\u00f3n, pues pas\u00f3 de laborar toda la semana en su taller, a hacerlo s\u00f3lo los fines de semana, y complementar sus ingresos trabajando como operaria de otro taller durante la semana; todo esto, porque se vio obligada a manejar un bajo perfil para no correr m\u00e1s peligros con el grupo delicuencial.  Actualmente, la cliente solicita el cr\u00e9dito, con el fin de invertirlo en la compra de insumos al por mayor (telas, hilos, botones, el\u00e1sticos) aprovechando los descuentos que obtiene por compras de contado, lo que le permitir\u00e1 tener m\u00e1s variedad para ofrecer a sus clientes y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n, ya que en el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o le realizan muy buenos pedidos, por lo tanto incrementa sus ingresos. Esto le permite so\u00f1ar con cumplir el sue\u00f1o de abrir un almac\u00e9n a mediano plazo, en el que pueda comercializar sus productos y volver a generar oportunidades de empleo, mejorando la calidad de vida de su familia y la de muchas otras personas que influyen en el desarrollo de su labor. ","en":"Silvia\u2019s a 42-year-old woman; she has two children and is separated at the moment.  She\u2019s worked for 10 years sewing clothes, an activity she learned empirically.  She worked as an employee in several workshops where she perfected her techniques and acquired more occupational skills.  All of this experience and knowledge acquired led to her being able to open her own business: a home-based workshop where she started to make her own line of pajamas, women\u2019s blouses and athletic wear.\r\n\r\nSilvia has had to face several problems because there are several criminal gangs in the zone where she\u2019s located that extort and charge protection fees from merchants which led to her having to dismiss her employees that helped her and decrease her level of production.  She changed from working all week in her workshop to just doing so on weekends and added to her income by being employed as an operator in another shop during the week.  She did all this because she was forced to lower her profile to avoid being subject to any more danger from the criminal gangs.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently requesting a loan to buy supplies at wholesale (fabric, thread, buttons, elastic) taking advantage of available discounts for cash sales which will make it possible for her to have more variety to offer her customers and thus increase production since the second semester of the year means more orders that increase her income.\r\n\r\nThis allows her to dream with reaching her goal of opening a store in the medium run where she can sell her products and once again generate employment opportunities improving the quality of life of her family and of many others who take part in her work\u2019s development.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1418726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural

He has done this since 1998 with a motive of getting a source of income to meet his family's needs. He has 13 children and money from the tea business provides for all their needs. He devotes to the business seven hours per day and his hard work has helped him improve the quality harvested every month.

She works taking care of her home and cultivating the land alongside her life companion.  They are both people who have liked to work very hard since childhood to provide sustenance for their family and so that they will lack nothing.  To head to her farmland she and her life companion must walk 30 minutes and ford the river since their farmland is on the other side.  She\u2019s had three children but they no longer live with her; all are working.  She\u2019s currently 41-years-old.\r\n\r\nShe comes from a family of very scarce economic resources; they all had to work in order to provide sustenance at home.  This is how she learned the agricultural chores.  Also, in order to earn extra family income she makes snacks on days when there are soccer games in the local community field.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to buy manure and fertilizer for the corn and bean crops because she has 7,000 square meters planted which generates a substantial cost in agricultural supplies.  However, if she\u2019s able to buy them all at once she saves a little money and time because she can get them cheaper and only has to take one trip to buy them because she lives in a rural zone with very bad roads and no public transportation; she has to pay a vehicle in order to make the trip with her purchases.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her efforts won\u2019t be in vain and to obtain a good crop yield of grains because this will be of great economic help to her during the season when it\u2019s not possible to cultivate.  She\u2019d like to get to know her grandchildren and to be able to see them grow up in a world where they can live healthfully free of problems and that they become working people in the communities where they live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1418732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T17:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T17:40:12Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.75,"local_amount":55.75,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":55.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090963},{"amount":24.53,"local_amount":24.53,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":24.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622365},{"amount":119.72,"local_amount":119.72,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":119.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818167}],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T21:05:40Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":598884,"name":"Jackline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackline is 27 years old and married to David; they have been blessed with four children between the ages of 10 and 5. \r\n\r\nJackline runs an electronic shop in Ahero in Kisumu county and she is served by the Kadet Ltd Kapsabet branch.

They have 2 children who live with them in their own house.  Manuel works in agriculture and looks after his crops every morning from the early hours. He grows potatoes, peas and corn, which he sells in his local central market after the harvest. He also says that the same traders visit his farmlands during the growing season to negotiate for his crops.

She is an enterprising and hard-working woman who never let herself get defeated by the lack of opportunities her lack of education put forth.  She was able to go to secondary school, but she didn't finish.  Nelly married Luis, who is now 67-years old, when she was very young.  Luis works separately from Nelly as a store-owner.  They had three children together who are now all grown, each with his own obligations and independence.  Nelly lives with her husband in Santo Domingo, the inland port that ties the Coastal and Mountainous Regions of Ecuador.  Santo Domingo has become one of the country's most important cities because of the high commerce traffic that exists and because of the agricultural and livestock production that is generated there.\r\nBy taking advantage of the tourist and business traffic, many of the San Domingue\u00f1os have established businesses that earn them an income and, in some cases, provide employment for others.  \r\nNelly started her business 25 years ago selling fast food from a sales stall.  It was very productive for her and little by little she expanded and improved her business.  She works from Monday to Sunday in the evenings and at night, which is when the demand is highest.  Her husband helps her and, in addition, she has begun to stock up her business with sweets and a variety of other items to sell from her storefront.  With the passage of time, her storefront has become run-down and needs some repairs.  That is why Nelly is requesting a loan, with which she will paint and fix-up her storefront so that it is suitable for giving dignified service to her customers.  One year ago, Nelly took out a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.  She invested it in working capital.  She was always up to date with her repayment schedule and now, one year later, she is returning to look for assistance so she can earn more customers and see her income increase.  This will help her to improve her standard of living and have some money saved for health concerns for herself and her husband.  They went through a difficult experience two years ago when her husband fell ill.  The costs were very high and almost ruined them financially. \r\nNelly is grateful to the Kiva lenders, who make is possible for so many dreams to come true around the world.

He appointed a helper over his workshop to look after things and to convince the customers from outside to use the business. The number of customers has increased, due to his good attitude and impressive dealing. \r\n\r\nTo sustain his reputation and to meet the increasing demands, Nazia's husband has urgent need of putty and paint. Her husband is a poor person. Due to household expenses, he does not have enough savings to buy the desired material for his workshop. Therefore, Nazia is trying to help her husband, in the form of a loan, so that her husband would be able to buy dent repair tools and cans of paint. \r\n\r\nNazia hopes that this loan will bring positive changes to her husband's business and in the lives of her family members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1416082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy dent repair tools and cans of paint for denting services.

For that, she is working every day without rest.\r\n \r\nXatira is opting for a new loan because she needs more working capital in order to continue investing in her business. This investment will help her to buy raw materials for making bread, such as flour, sugar, eggs, firewood, and more. Her previous loan helped her to grow her business and have everything necessary in order to work. This is why her economic condition has improved, as well as her family circumstances.\r\n\r\nXatira has already borrowed five loans from Aqroinvest in the past. With a good loan history, she has applied for her sixth loan of 1,800 AZN.

Their house is in poor condition, so he wants to improve their living situation. <p>\r\n\r\nNabeela and her husband realize that they have to generate more income to pay for the construction that would be needed for their house. Therefore, Nabeela requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can increase his inventory and ultimately sell more jewelry. She hopes that they will be able to work on the house soon to improve the family's living standards.

Her previous loan was a big help for her business. She was able to buy the supplies and materials needed for her metals business. Her income from that loan also helped to pay for her children's education and for their family's living expenses. She also has a trading business where she buys and sells t-shirts. She and her husband work hard to provide for their everyday needs. <p>\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 51,000 PHP loan so that she can buy supplies such as glass, stainless steel, and other materials used in her business. Profits from the business help her cover her family's daily living expenses and her children's educational expenses. She thanks all lenders for their support. <p>\r\n\r\nRosalina dreams of having her own stall and stockroom and hopes that her children will have a good future.

years old.  Her life partner works as an assistant bricklayer.  Both of them put forth great effort in order to give their daughter, who is in the seventh grade at the community school center, an excellent quality of life.  Ever since she was very little, Nancy has put forth effort to work very hard.  This way she has been able to get her house and her daily sustenance.  She lives in her house with her life partner and her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe has been working as a domestic employee for 15 years.  She started where her aunt was, and now she is working in another house, where she has worked for six years.  In order to get there she has to travel for 15 minutes by bus and walk for another 10 minutes.  When she comes home from work, where her life partner and daughter are waiting for her, she has to do the household chores.  Because her work is from 7:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m., she does not have a lot of time to spend with her family.  However, in the end she feels that this effort if rewarded by the unity that they have as a family. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy sand, iron, and cement blocks in order to build a room.  This is because the house where she lives does not have much privacy.  Her life will improve because she will feel safer at night.  The purchase price will be lower because buying in quantity will give her a small discount.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wishes to make her house bigger so that they are able to live more comfortably and have another baby.  She and her life partner want their daughter to finish her education and be guided down the right path.  They want all of their efforts to bear fruit in the very near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1418803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy sand, iron, and cement blocks in order to build a room.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-28T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-27T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Rosaliny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":40.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":51.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":9.48,"local_amount":9.48,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":9.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090894},{"amount":60.27,"local_amount":60.27,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":60.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856890},{"amount":37.02,"local_amount":37.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":37.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716238},{"amount":37.53,"local_amount":37.53,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":37.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621871},{"amount":43.27,"local_amount":43.27,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":43.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088109},{"amount":47.91,"local_amount":47.91,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":47.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902377},{"amount":150.97,"local_amount":150.97,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":150.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215580},{"amount":34.11,"local_amount":34.11,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":34.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008133},{"amount":79.44,"local_amount":79.44,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":79.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501805}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T21:02:16Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:38:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":600452,"name":"Amistad Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado  Amistad est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero dos del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, donde todas trabajan y se ayudan por salir adelante.

This work will enable her to generate resources in order to support her home and family including her son.\r\n \r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the continuing trainings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5850,"image":{"id":1418819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T01:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T01:00:01Z","loan_amount":5850,"lender_count":189,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patty Faty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Neli\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yhovana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":40364,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4624.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4710.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4839.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4971.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5086.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5261.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5388.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5482.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":670.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":682.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":701.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":720.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":737.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":762.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":780.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":794.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":670.24,"local_amount":4624.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4631.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197935},{"amount":682.65,"local_amount":4710.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4716.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153682},{"amount":701.43,"local_amount":4839.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4846.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615255},{"amount":720.51,"local_amount":4971.4,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4978.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736194},{"amount":1499.64,"local_amount":10347.2,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10361.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641705},{"amount":780.89,"local_amount":5388.04,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5395.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108644},{"amount":794.64,"local_amount":5482.88,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5490.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923734}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T01:53:51Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T12:49:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":598965,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is very thankful for the financial assistance extended to her.

cuidando una finca de \u00e1rboles de pino y debe caminar 45 minutos hasta llegar al lugar, dos d\u00edas por semana sale a buscar bovinos para comprar y en la pr\u00f3xima semana salir a venderlos, para ello tiene que recorrer grandes distancias. \n\n\u00e9l antes era padre soltero; pero se volvi\u00f3 a acompa\u00f1ar. Su compa\u00f1era de vida se dedica \u00fanicamente a los trabajos  dom\u00e9sticos, a estar pendiente de sus dos peque\u00f1os. A parte de su compa\u00f1era de vida y sus hijos con \u00e9l vive su mam\u00e1, quien ayuda  a realizar los oficios hogare\u00f1os.\n\n\u00c9l se dedica a comerciar ganado bovino en  el municipio donde reside y en sus alrededores.

He wakes up at 4:30 in the morning to begin work. He cares for a pine tree farm and has to walk 45 minutes to that location. Twice a week he goes to find cattle to buy so he can sell them the next week. To do all this, he must cover long distances.\r\n\r\nHe used to be a single father, but he has since found a partner. She works out of the home so as to be available to their two children. In addition to his partner and their children, his mother lives with them, and she also helps with the household labor.\r\n\r\nHis primary work is selling cattle in the town where he lives and other towns nearby. He has four years of experience in the work, which he learned by following a  neighbor around when he was younger. When he realized he didn't have any other options for bringing in income, he decided to begin working at what he had learned.\r\n\r\nHe also receives income for caring for a pine tree farm. Before he began to sell cattle, he was a farm day laborer. The farm he cares for is about 3km (1.8 miles) from his house, which he travels to on foot. He works in the field from 6am to 4pm.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used to purchase a pair of oxen and a heifer, which he will later resell. This will allow his family to meet the expenses for their basic needs and allow them to keep improving their overall situation a little at a time.\r\n\r\nHe plans to keep working with the foundation that continues to support him, borrowing greater amounts. With future loans, he hopes to plaster his home since it is made of adobe and isn't particularly secure. With future income, he wants to invest in purchasing more animals and putting them up for sale. He would like to have a good marketplace where he can buy and sell. He says that he can achieve all this by committing himself to redoubling his efforts, regardless of how early or late he has to work, and by not limiting himself to just one thing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1418834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase

She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan to buy gallons of palm oil for resale.

Additional income created will allow him to reinvest in his business, meet the needs of his family, and educate his children. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Francis would like to eradicate poverty and uplift the living standards of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1414654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase maize, beans, cow peas, and green grams in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mwingi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5556},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5556},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5556},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5556},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5556},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5556},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5556},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5556},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5552}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.89,"local_amount":5556,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5590.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410124666},{"amount":63.9,"local_amount":5556,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:23:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5590.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419890170},{"amount":63.89,"local_amount":5556,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T18:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5590.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429538872},{"amount":63.9,"local_amount":5556,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5590.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439873734},{"amount":63.89,"local_amount":5556,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5590.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449762731},{"amount":63.89,"local_amount":5556,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5590.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459243295},{"amount":63.9,"local_amount":5556,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5590.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468068288},{"amount":127.74,"local_amount":11108,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":11177.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490982310}],"funded_date":"2013-09-23T01:14:14Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T20:20:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":598997,"name":"Sophia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophia is 38 years old.

From Tujijenge Tanzania, this is MOHAMEDI's third loan request, which he will use to purchase more clothes to resell. With the previous loans, all of which he paid back successfully, he managed to improve his business by purchasing more clothes. His business profit, used to cover his home expenses, bought land. He used part of his profit to cover his marriage expenses. MOHAMEDI dreams that one day he will be able to own a big business and build a house.

His life partner also works with meat production chickens and egg-laying hens. Together they have 2 children, one of them is not studying and lives with an aunt, the second one is studying 4th grade and is 13 years old. Aside from his son and his life partner, his parents live with him.\r\n\r\nWilian earns an income for his family's sustenance by farming and raising meat production chickens. He has been working this way for 3 years and he learned this skill from his uncles who worked in this same farming branch for a long time. He used to help them manage the work and this is how he learned well and realized that in this way he could earn an income to get ahead. He also works farming basic grains (beans and corn). Before becoming a farmer, Wilian worked making clay bricks which he sold daily on the city streets. His life partner, his mother and his youngest son help him with his current farm work.\r\n\r\nHe requests the loan in order to purchase 100 chickens since the ones he currently has will soon be ready for sale and he doesn't want to be without product. He also hopes to invest the loan in purchasing 12 quintales (1 quintal = 100 kg) of concentrate feed, 6 of a starter formula and 6 of a finishing formula which should be enough to get his product ready for sale. The funding will help him have greater income and in this way help fulfill his family's most basic needs such as food, health, education and housing. He needs to purchase more chickens and to continue working.\r\n\r\nWilian says that in the future, he wishes to obtain a larger loan and with those funds settle all his loans. With the leftovers he would enlarge his chicken coops and improve the roof so that his chickens don't get wet. When the chickens get wet they become stressed and don't gain weight appropriately. On the other hand, he would like improve his family's comfort by building up two rooms in his house which have dirt floors."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1418842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 100 chickens and 12 quintales (1 quintal = 100 kg) of concentrate feed, 6 of a starter formula and 6 of a finishing formula","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilian Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":124.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":139.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":155.31},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":172.73},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":192.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":215.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Berrios","image":null}},{"id":599008,"name":"Valijon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valijon is 21 years old and lives with his parents in the south of Tajikistan.

The raw material melts under high temperature, and then he injects it into the dies to shape it. In this way he manufactures the bearings. He sells them in the market and makes enough income to contribute to his family's livelihood.\r\n\r\nShamim has three children and she barely manages to satisfy their needs. She is required to provide them with good food, health, and education. She needs to earn additional income to support her family well. She is in her third loan cycle with BRAC Pakistan. Currently, she has requested a loan to buy more raw materials for manufacturing so that her husband can increase his sales.

Juliet says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and insufficient finance to expand her business.\r\n\r\nJuliet has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items, such as rice, tomatoes and cooking seasonings.

This is 35-year-old Kadaitu from Tombo Western rural area in Freetown. She is married to a fisherman and blessed with three children between the ages five years and 18 years. Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nKadiatu runs a food stand business at home; she sells rice, onions and cooking seasoning. She has been running this business just after her wedding. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Kadaitu says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and insufficient finance to expand her business.\r\n\r\nKadiatu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items such as rice, tomato paste and cooking seasoning. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to open a big table. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1416227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy more cooking items such as rice, tomato paste and cooking seasoning for her food market activity.

She is married with two children, aged 6 and 18 years old.  \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Isatu established her cookery business. She began her business because she wants to create income to educate her children since she did not go to school. She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is a lack of enough capital to operate her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to purchase rice, cooking seasonings and palm oil to expand her cookery business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and increase her business. In the future, Isatu plans to open a restaurant. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1416248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

In 2003 the spouses started a business selling mobile phones using an amount of 20,000 som (KGS) as a starting capital. They were able to build the business and have regular customers. Almira has an average monthly income in the amount of 20,000 KGS. Because of her hard work in the business the spouses where able to buy a store in the town's center. With the goal to further grow and expand their business Almira has come to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som to increase the sale of goods. Almira plans to invest the income from the loan into growth and expansion of her business and also improve the financial situation of her

provide his family with a good standard of living. Maher is not a Lebanese citizen. He is a nomadic Arab of unspecified nationality, like others living in Lebanon whose ancestors came to Lebanon illegally a long time ago and didn't register with the Lebanese government. He can't benefit from any official Lebanese governmental jobs or formal working sectors, but he can do his job and live freely in Lebanon, since he is not making any trouble.
