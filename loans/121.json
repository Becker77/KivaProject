It floods during the rainy season and the community is semi-urban.<p>She displays her grocery alongside a road, where she has a stall, for people to buy. Her main challenge is working in the open and the seasonality of what she sells. When there is scarcity, the prices run so high that the clientele shrinks, and the prices run very low in times of abundance. The short life of vegetables sometimes forces her to sell them off at low prices to avoid total loss.

(0) is a 55-year-old woman living in the town of Falevao.  She is married and has 7 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Seirosa owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Seirosa has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2004, Seirosa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Seirosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1100 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  Seirosa is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Seirosa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":382955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married to Ireneo L., an auto electrician, and is the mother of an elementary-aged child. By the grace of God, Lorence has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college. This is the dream of most Filipino parents like Lorence, who herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n<br>Lorence operates a meat shop where she also sells native milkfish delicacies such as boneless ones, meat-filled ones, and other products of the like. For her meat shop, she buys live pigs from hog-raisers. The pigs are then slaughtered and sold to the immediate community. She has many customers who buy the cut meat and then sell it on their respective market stalls. There are many customers who prefer Lorence\u2019s products since they are assured of their freshness and cleanliness. It is also a little cheaper to buy meat from an independent meat shop than the ones in the market that sometimes use the services of professional slaughterhouses for their meat. The cost of slaughter is added to the final price of the cut meat, and passed along to the customers. Thus, Lorence has many customers who regularly anticipate her meat and processed milkfish. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Lorence is requesting a loan of 22,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy live pigs to be slaughtered and sold every day. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Lorence dreams of being able to give her child a good, high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own market stall someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":597089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Before joining Friendship Bridge Maria had no access to credit and it was difficult to make money weaving just because the yarn was so expensive, costing up to US$40 for the yarn to make a huipil.\r\n<P>\r\nMaria\u00b4s husband died a couple of years ago when he got drunk and drowned in a lake nearby. With a total of seven children, she must now raise the five youngest by herself.   The two teenage daughters who still live at home are also weavers and help support the family. They attend school on the weekends so they can work during the week. All the school age children attend school, something Maria never had the opportunity to do. She never learned to read or write, speaks just a little bit of Spanish, and signs her name with a thumbprint impression.  Her native language is Ixil. \r\n<P>\r\nMaria's adobe home has a dirt floor and has electricity and water but the water must be boiled before consuming. \r\n<P>\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva Fellows."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":53365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase yarn for her weaving","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Nebaj, Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.405833 -91.146111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-08-09T21:45:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-23T22:36:08Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2007-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2007-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2007-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2007-09-24T09:18:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58141},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2007-10-24T09:19:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71371},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2007-11-24T10:21:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86001},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2007-12-24T10:18:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":102024},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-01-24T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":121006},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-02-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":141263},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164989},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190648},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218162}],"funded_date":"2007-08-09T22:36:08Z","paid_date":"2008-05-24T09:03:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":19902,"name":"Erdulfa","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Erdulfa is 67 years old and she is a widow.

She maintains that it has been worth it because her rice farm income has been very helpful in meeting her family's daily needs.\r\n<p>\r\nRoselyn plans to buy fertilizers and seeds with her loan of 15,000 PHP, making it truly worthwhile. She is hopeful for a better yield this time, especially since her children's needs are growing in number.

He was also looking for a way to create a stream of extra income and become his own boss, so he researched possible businesses. He discovered an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) franchising opportunity which met his criteria. By placing and maintaining ATMs at hotels and other travel businesses in the Washington D.C. area, Don earns part of the convenience fee busy travelers pay.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019s ACCION USA loan will allow him to expand by adding another ATM placement. He plans to continue growing his business, hoping to eventually hire staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Tederlita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Tederlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tederlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. \n\nTederlita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Stephen will educate his children and invest in raising livestock.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Ngamilo group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Stephen is pictured with his group members.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":914995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Calistus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gentrix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":43400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":43400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":45115.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680721}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T13:28:57Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":360875,"name":"Yacine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme Yacine est une jeune d\u00e9butante dans le commerce car cela ne fait qu\u2019un 1 an qu\u2019elle s\u2019est lanc\u00e9.

Coming from a family of seven children, she left school very early because her parents, short on funds, had preferred to send the boys to school to the detriment of the girls.  So she turned towards an apprenticeship in dressmaking.  Unfortunately, since completing her apprenticeship five years ago, she lacked the money to open up her own shop.  She worked outdoors at home using sewing machines she rents from friends and acquaintances.  But with the quality of her work, she received a lot of orders that are filled late just because of a lack of machines available.  Her customer base continued to grow and grow, so using the little money she saved, she decided to lease a shop of her own called \u00abYoyo Couture\u00bb.  But she still runs up against the problem of finances.  Her husband, a furniture maker without a steady income, finds himself unable to help her despite his willingness to do so.  A very level-headed and energetic young woman, Yolande needs financial support to make things work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nYolande is requesting a loan of $950 to renovate her shop and to buy two sewing machines.

She will walk the streets with her products and sell them to interested buyers. She will continue selling bread, fruits and vegetables along with the new bedspreads and ponchos.  The markup for these items is better than that for fruits and vegetables so she hopes to save a little to get ahead in life.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria is not married and has 8 children. The 3 youngest children live with her and attend school. Schooling is something Maria never had the opportunity to do.

She is very proud to see her children better themselves through education as she betters herself by participating in the Friendship Bridge microfinance group. As a member of the women's group, Flor de Liz, she benefits from the informal education portions of each monthly meeting.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has 4 children, all of whom are in school.  She has no additional family members.  She has a business of operating a bar.  She has been in this business for 10 years, and she works 7 days out of every week. She sells her products from home at retail prices. The main business challenges for Madina include seasonality. \r\n\r\nMadina has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy crates of beer and soda.

Sus padres se separaron cuando \u00e9l era muy peque\u00f1o, por lo que siempre ha vivido con sus hermanos.\n\nDesde hace tres a\u00f1os, Wilber se ha dedicado a la venta de especias: comino, achote, pimienta gorda, pimienta negra  y otras m\u00e1s. Su hermana fue quien le ense\u00f1o esta actividad, la cual se ha convertido en su fuente de ingresos. \u00c9l se levanta a las 5:00 de la ma\u00f1ana, a realizar sus labores diarias. Se traslada a la capital del pa\u00eds a comprar las especies, para esto aborda un autob\u00fas, el viaje dura dos horas y media, para llegar a la Terminal, luego aborda un microb\u00fas que lo conduce al centro de la ciudad, despu\u00e9s camina a pie hasta  el mercado central, es ah\u00ed donde compra su mercader\u00eda y regresa a casa. Las especias las compra por libras y por galones. Por lo que, debe dividir en bolsas peque\u00f1as las porciones, para posteriormente irlas a vender a los diferentes municipios y cantones, \u00e9l va de tienda en tienda, ofreciendo su mercader\u00eda, para regresar a su casa a las 5:00 de la tarde.\n\nWilber utilizara su pr\u00e9stamo, para comprar: 12 libras de achote, 12 libras de comino, 14 libras de pimientas, 12 libras de comino molido, 10 libras de sal de ajo, 8 libras de sal de cebolla, 10 libras de canela, 6 libras de romero, 9 libras de chan, 6 libras de almid\u00f3n, 8 libras de bicarbonato, 4 libras de an\u00eds, 6 galones de mostaza, 6 galones de salsa negra, 6 de dulce, 6 galones de chile, entre otros m\u00e1s.\n\nCon esta inversi\u00f3n, Wilber surtir\u00e1 su negocio, comprara por mayor y esto le permitir\u00e1 dar mejores precio a sus clientes y cubrir\u00e1 la demanda de estos. Obtendr\u00e1 mejores ingresos ahorrorando tiempo y dinero, ya que \u00e9l viaja dos veces por semana a la capital y con la inversi\u00f3n solo ira una vez a la semana a comprar su mercader\u00eda.\n\nWilber es un joven emprendedor, que le ha tocado luchar para salir adelante. De los ingresos que reciba por la venta de su mercader\u00eda, \u00e9l ahorra, ya que quiere que su negocio crezca y emplear a dos o tres personas, para que salgan a vender y \u00e9l encargarse de preparar la mercader\u00eda. De esta forma tendr\u00e1 m\u00e1s tiempo disponible, ya que por razones econ\u00f3micas dejo de estudiar en la universidad, y su gran sue\u00f1o es graduarse de licenciado en ingles, pues solo le hacen falta dos a\u00f1os. Para alcanzar sus sue\u00f1os, Wilber trabaja muy fuerte y ahorrara lo m\u00e1s que pueda, para continuar con sus estudios el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o y graduarse.\n\n \n","en":"Wilber is 29 and single. He lives with a sister and two cousins. His parents separated when he was very young, so he has always lived with his siblings.\r\n\r\nWilber has sold spices for three years: cumin, annatto, allspice, black pepper, and others. His sister taught him this business, and it is now his source of income. He gets up at 5:00 am to go to work. He goes to the capital city by bus to buy his spices. The trip takes him two and a half hours to get to the terminal, then he gets on a microbus which drives him downtown. After this, he walks to the central market where he buys his merchandise; then he returns home. He buys the spices by the pound and by the gallon. He then divides them into smaller portions to sell in the various municipalities and cantons. He goes from store to store, offering his products, and comes home at 5:00 pm.\r\n\r\nWilber will use this loan to buy: to buy 12 pounds of annatto, 12 pounds of cumin, 14 pounds of peppers,\r\n12 pounds of ground cumin, 10 pounds of garlic salt, 8 pounds of onion salt, 10 pounds of cinnamon, 6 pounds of rosemary, 9 pounds of chia, 6 pounds of starch, 8 pounds of bicarbonate, 4 pounds of aniseed, 6 gallons of mustard, 6 gallons of black salsa, 6 of jam, 6 gallons of chili, and other items.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, Wilber will be able to stock his business. He will buy his products wholesale, allowing him to offer his customers better prices and to cover their demand. He will be able to make a better income through saving time and money, since he goes to the capital twice a week, and with this investment he will only have to go once a week.\r\n\r\nWilber is an enterprising young man, who has fought to get ahead. He saves his earnings, since he wants his business to grow so that he can hire two or three people to go out and sell his products while he stays back and prepares them. This way he will have more time; for financial reasons, he had to stop attending university. His greatest dream is to graduate with a Bachelor in English; he is only two years short. In order to achieve his dreams, Wilber works very hard and saves as much as he can so that he can continue with his studies next year and graduate."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":907059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

He has 6 children, all of whom are grown. Some of his sons still work with him on the farm during the heavy cycles of rice production. He has depended on his lands for his entire life. He also has some cattle that he raises and uses for milk production. Julio will invest the loan mainly in pesticides and the rental of machinery to pick the rice he has already planted. The loan will help increase his profits as he will not lose as much production as before and it will be easier to collect his product.<\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Julio is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T17:07:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-29T19:57:14Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21386},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:09:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40768},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:02:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45287},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:02:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99041},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:41:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106801}],"funded_date":"2007-04-15T19:57:14Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:41:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11742,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Rosa has a small beauty salon where she styles hair and provides manicures.

He is an agriculturist, a job he loves, and it has been the principle source of income for him for the last 32 years. He has 0.8 hectares of land where he produces different kinds of vegetables, and also he has a area of apricot trees on his land. Thanks to the experience that he has gained during the 32 years, he gets a rich harvest every year from his land. In light of the current high demand, Ruziboy would like to improve his land and production to meet the market. In order to do this, he is seeking a loan to buy fuels and lubricants, fertilizer, and saplings for improving and expanding his harvest. He would then be able to better provide for his children's schooling, health, and food. You could become an important part of Ruziboy's family's life. He deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Alma began this business because of her family as the business was originally run by her father and it was he who taught her this business. As she needed a way of earning a living she decided to take over the business. Alma plans to continue this business and she plans to leave it to her children. The financing will be used for working capital to invest in buying materials such as wood, paint, paintbrushes, glue, sandpaper and more.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Shoira is 29 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is married and the loving mother of two children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. <P>\r\n\r\nNow Shoira dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle and with the income she generates, she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends. Shoira asks for a 750 USD loan in order to buy more calves to later sell when they are fully grown. With this investment she will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her family's quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal.   \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The remaining two children are in 9th grade.  \r\n\r\nAzeezan\u2019s husband runs a grocery shop and in the evening he sells milk. He has six buffaloes at his home. Azeezan takes care of the buffalos in the absence of her husband and gets milk from them so when her husband comes home from work he can sell the milk without any delay. \r\n\r\nAzeezan lives in a four room brick house. Part of the house is dedicated for the buffalo while other rooms are used by her family. She has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband.  His dairy business is going good and giving him good earning.  With the loan he will add large quantities of groceries in  to his grocery shop.  She is hopeful that an investment will result in higher profits from her husband\u2019s business and her family\u2019s financial condition will get better. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her fourth loan cycle.
