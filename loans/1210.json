Nelson vive en la Parroquia Valle Hermoso del cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo en Ecuador. Valle Hermoso es una parroquia rural en donde hay aproximadamente diez mil habitantes, es el escenario para los amantes de los deportes extremos, pues sus cascadas y r\u00edos son los recursos naturales m\u00e1s adecuados para esto. Es un sitio con clima c\u00e1lido y sus habitantes tienen un esp\u00edritu emprendedor impresionante, pues a pesar de la dificultad de transporte que tienen siempre hay una forma de generar recursos para cada  una de sus familias.

","en":"Nelson is a 30 year old young man. He is single and doesn\u2019t have children. He grew up in the country, where his parents taught him about animal husbandry and agriculture. Due to a lack of economic resources, he wasn\u2019t able to continue his studies, although with great effort he did finish primary school. Nelson lives in the Valle Hermoso neighborhood of the Santo Domingo canton, or district, in Ecuador. Valle Hermoso is a very rural area in which there are about ten thousand residents. It is a destination for the lovers of extreme sports, because the waterfalls and rivers are the best resources for that. It is an area with a hot climate, and its residents have an impressive enterprising spirit, because in spite of the transportation difficulties that exist, they always have a way of generating income for each of the families.  There aren\u2019t any buses that reach this precinct; only motorcycles have access to the area. For this reason, the majority of people head out on Fridays to the city via motorcycle. \r\n\r\nTwelve years ago Nelson established his own pig farm, something that he learned how to do at home as a young boy. When it became time for him to look for a way to support himself, he decided to undertake his own business enterprise. He works between 8 and 10 hours a day, seven days a week, because his customers could come to buy pigs at any time, without notice. The land where he breeds the pigs was inherited, but he hasn\u2019t managed to legalize his ownership with the proper paperwork due to a lack of resources to hire a lawyer and cut through the red tape. For this reason, Nelson is asking for a loan that will help him to complete the legal procedures and, in that way, support his inheritance so he can avoid any future risk that someone might take away his property.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Nelson will be able to buy another pig, which will create additional income. This will help him to improve his quality of life and improve the administration of his job everyday.\r\n\r\nThanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, his growth is possible, because they haven\u2019t dragged their feet in going to his home and getting to know his business and the details of his work, even when they faced a lot of difficulty in getting there."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1418749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is married with 3 children between the ages of 4 and 11. In 2007, Fatmata established her palm oil business. She began her business because she wants to generates her own source of income. She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, 7 days a week. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase more palm oil to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and increase her business. In the future, Fatmata plans to expand her business more.

She expects to earn a profit of 130,500 FCFA by the end of the season, which she will use to repay her loan and to help her husband with the day-to-day expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1419201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy inputs, seeds and small farming equipment, and to cover the cost of plowing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Djigonso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adiaratou Sidi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima Doutigui ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawaha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kariya Datie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta Karitie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa Wopire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou Vieux","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":590000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":590000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1225,"local_amount":590000,"processed_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":600929.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045090}],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T16:49:33Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T16:38:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":600660,"name":"San Pedro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 San Pedro esta integrado con 19 mujeres muy trabajadoras, que con su lucha diaria est\u00e1n saliendo adelante.

Accepting cash or credit, she resells the goods to a customer base composed mostly of women in Sabalibougou and by going door to door.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Ami hopes to make an average monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA that will be used for reinvesting in her business and ensuring healthcare for the children at home.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":1419221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase secondhand clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"District de Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":300464.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207682},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":300464.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972372},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":300464.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624922},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":300464.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850927}],"funded_date":"2013-09-03T16:18:01Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":599348,"name":"Binapani Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muniguda is a small town in the Rayagada district of Odisha, India where Gouri, about 30 years old, resides with her husband and two daughters who are about 9 & 12 years old.

She is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine so that she can provide a milling service to over 300 families in her community. \n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most families in Chibombo District grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create a flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima. Terry is already operating a small shop in the community and wants to expand by adding the maize mill as a service. \n\nRent-to-Own has done market research in her community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest maize mill is 11km away from Terry, but it is currently not functional. This means most clients have to travel more than 15km to a roadside community, and since most clients walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. \n\nEquipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost for many business women such as Terry, as it allows for her to diversify her business. Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill can be very prohibitive.

She works for a company doing embroidery and also sells different kinds of fruits, such as apples, oranges, bananas, and other things.  Her husband helps with the sales and they have a good customer base.  People prefer her because she sells good fruit at good prices and the service is unequalled.  Glenda is dedicated to her work and always ready to take advantage of her time and opportunities.  Her family\u2019s wellbeing is her priority, so she works hard to give them the best.  She is worried because it\u2019s already winter and her house needs a retaining wall to keep the water out when it rains.

She is married and has two children, ages 9 and 26 years.  She began her business because she wanted to create her own source of income, instead of depending on her husband. In 2009, Koso established her general store business.  She works at the business from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nKoso requires a loan in order to purchase more items to sell, like cigarettes, biscuits, soft drinks and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her child's school fees and to buy a piece of land. In the future, Koso plans to own the biggest shop in the community.

In addition, many logging companies are located in the county.  People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of 'fufu,' a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.\r\n\r\nLucy is 45, married, and has two children, aged 19 and 25.  Only one is currently living at home and attending school. Lucy has a shop, where she sells cold water, rice, drinks, and other goods. She has had the shop for the past 13 years.  On average, she works ten hours per day at her business, from Monday to Saturday.  She started her business with a little bit of capital from her husband. She transports her merchandise by taxi.  She cites too few goods in her shop, as her biggest challenge.  She enjoys the profit-making of the business.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more goods to sell at her shop, including clean water by the sack, rice, and drinks.  In the future, she would like to own a house.

She is a mother of nine children. Nowadays, she caters to only four kids, as three of them are in school and one is too young for schooling. \r\n\r\nIn her household, the family\u2019s income is from her pig-raising business and her husband\u2019s occupation as a blacksmith. Now, she is short of working capital to buy pig feed for her business. Therefore, she leads a group of two borrowers to get a new loan from VisionFund. Ruom is a third-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2018s partner).

","en":"Rakhimakhon is 48 and married with four children. She has a high school education. Her neighbours speak of her as a diligent and responsible woman. Her husband is a small businessman and her son and older daughter are working in Russia and send money to support their parents every month. Rakhimakhon's husband and children actively help around the house and farm. Her family is very friendly and they have very good relationships with each other.\r\n\r\nSince 2000, Rakhimakhon has been raising livestock and crops as the main source of income for her family, a business she began with 5,000 KGS. She has great experience raising and keeping cattle. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now includes two milking cows and six sheep, as well as 0.3 hectares of agricultural land on which she is growing potatoes, sunflowers and corn. Her agricultural work brings in about 10,000 KGS per month, which serves as the primary source of payment for her family's groceries and other everyday needs. The profits from her farm have allowed Rakhimakhon to bring up and provide for her children, and to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her farm, Rakhimakhon has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 70,000 KGS to purchase cows. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further enlargement of her property as well as, in the future, to renovate the house in which she and her family live.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1416856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

mother blessed with seven children. The main sources of her family\u2019s income are from paddy rice farming and a small income from her husband job as motor-taxi driver.  With this new loan, she is the second-time borrower and her co-borrower is the third-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

She is applying for a loan so she can pay for her university studies. This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is  Perla Massiel. I'm 18 and live in Licey -Santiago with my parents. I was born in Santiago, have two younger brothers, and am the oldest child. \r\n\r\nMy father works as a blacksmith and my mother works in a family internet center. I'm in the third semester of the medial program in Utesa- Santiago. I've dreamed of being a doctor since I was a a young girl. Playing with other children, I was always the doctor, and my enthusiasm for that role has remained an inspiration. It was my motivation to earn a bachelor's degree as a nurse technician in preparation for my medical studies.   \r\n\r\nI've also seen the needs of people who have died around me because they lack money to pay for medical care. When I graduate, I want to support my community and make a contribution to the larger region through my knowledge and experience. But I can only do this with the support of Kiva's loan program.

Battambang province. He has five children. To deal with the daily cost of living, he does rice cropping and pineapple planting. To help the family generate more income, his wife sells dessert after helping him on the rice farm. He has been involved in his current business for ages, earning about 20,000 KHR per day. This is the third loan for Samun\u2019s group, composed of three members, with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

He went to school up to the 9th grade. He is married, and his wife dedicates herself to the needs of the household. He has three children, aged 19, 17 and 15, of whom two are in school. In addition to his wife and children, his sister-in-law and her baby also live with him. \r\n\r\nHe works as a mechanic in body work and painting. He learned this profession out of necessity, since his parents were not able to cover the household expenses, and for this reason they sometimes went for days without anything to eat. Thus he went to a mechanic's workshop and became an apprentice, and little by little he learned this trade. Currently, he has 30 years of experience as a mechanic in body work and painting. He travels on a bicycle to the workshop, which is 4 kilometers from his house, and he works from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will buy a new compressor, which will be greatly useful in his work. Without one, he is unable to paint the vehicles he repairs; thus, he cannot finish the jobs himself and does not have that income to support his family. It is also inconvenient for his customers, because the vehicles are not repaired within a reasonable time. However, now he will be able to continue his work, thanks to the loan provided to him. \r\n\r\nHis dream for his children is to see them gain professional training, so that they can face the future and not suffer through what he experienced. With regard to his work, he would like to set up a large workshop offering a range of automotive services, but he recognizes that for this he will have to work twice as hard as he has done up to now.

She spends her time taking care of her children and doing the many household chores.  She starts her day by making breakfast for her husband and children so they can go to work and school.  Then she gets ready to clean her house and wash the clothes, spending all morning on this.  Then she makes lunch for her children.\r\n\r\nThis is how Brenda's days are.  It's a job without remuneration but with the satisfaction of being with her family and living happily.\r\n\r\nThe loan she's requesting is to buy materials to improve the infrastructure of the roof on her house.  The roof has deteriorated because of the recent rains, and it's leaking.  This damages her electrical appliances and other belongings.  Thanks to the loan all these problems will be resolved and her family's quality of life will be better.\r\n\r\nBrenda's goal is to set up a store in her house and help her husband with the income.

Her parents also live in her house, but they are not financially dependent on her.\r\n\r\nIngrid established a tortilla making business 5 years ago.

Her fiancee is wood seller. She has three children aged between 4 and 7, they are in school and live at home.\r\n\r\nShe has been operating a shop for the past six years, selling rice, milk, sugar, pepper, oil etc. She works at her business for nine hours each day.

She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.

She buys animals (baby goats) at low prices, brings them up, and then sells them at the market at higher prices.

From the time I started, my biggest challenge has been to source working capital so that I can satisfy the customer demand, and expand my business. My business provides an essential service required for most livelihoods in a cheap and fast way. People come to my shop to send and receive money. This Kiva loan will help me realize my dream of expanding my Zoona cash transfer business in Chama district in the Eastern province. I will use the money to purchase a trading booth and use my capital to serve customers. My dream is to own a chain of Zoona mobile money transfer shops across the country, so that I can provide an essential service targeted at marketeers and people with no bank accounts. I am hopeful that having access to Kiva loans will make my dream a reality.

This business yields a good income for him, but his family's needs are increasing day by day and he needs to earn more money. Now he wants to buy more raw materials for making furniture in order to expand his business. That is why he came to BRAC Pakistan and described his wish to obtain a loan to buy raw materials for marking furniture.

She has always worked for them and dreams of getting them ahead. Another of her dreams has always been to study at an academy. Her whole life she has wanted to go to beauty school and learn facial and body treatments, beacuse it is a beautiful thing to have contact with other people and help them in one way or another. She wants to work with her sister Mary Luz, who is a beautician, and her sister Ang\u00e9lica, who is a manicurist, and set up a very large salon providing comprehensive beauty and styling services, or if possible a spa. With God's help, she wants to make all of her dreams come true, and in order to do so she needs to study and work very hard, because her goal is to provide for her daughters and for them to have careers, since when she was young she only went to high school and was never able to attend university or get a higher education. Later on, when her salon is up and running and everything is going well, she plans to hire workers so that they can open more businesses and manage them, making sure that they offer the best customer service. She wants to keep her customers happy and satisfied with the help they receive, because that is the secret to everything: the quality of what you do, beacuse you must always do things with love and dedication. \r\n\r\nLuz Eneida is a woman who has always cared about looking good. Her set purpose is that by becomeing a beautician she will feel good about helping others look good and about offering employment opportunities. Her parents and siblings are her motivation, and her goal is to buy them a house so that they can rest and enjoy their retirement. For now she will continue to dream and to try to make everything a reality with all of her effort and the drive she is known for and that has made her a brave woman."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1419367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to go to beauty school.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-30T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-29T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Eneida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":2,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":144610.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539985},{"amount":150,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-27T09:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":289220.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752523},{"amount":73.39,"local_amount":137000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":141511.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845844},{"amount":76.61,"local_amount":143000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":147709.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696798}],"funded_date":"2013-08-30T18:01:24Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":600965,"name":"Nelly  Esmeralda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"UN GRAN SUE\u00d1O DE AMOR Y SERVICIO.\nErase una vez una Joven Que Se Llamaba Luisa termino su Bachillerato en Bogot\u00e1 al finalizar el estudio del Colegio Luisa ten\u00eda el anhelo de estudiar algo de medicina, ya que cuando estaba en el colegio perteneci\u00f3 a un grupo de la cruz roja y ayudaba en las labores de enfermer\u00eda de la instituci\u00f3n atendiendo a los ni\u00f1os cuando la necesitaban y se sal\u00eda del sal\u00f3n para ayudar; Es as\u00ed como en el coraz\u00f3n de Luisa se albergaba un gran deseo de servicio a los dem\u00e1s a trav\u00e9s de la enfermer\u00eda y so\u00f1aba con poder trabajar en servicio de los ancianos, ni\u00f1os especiales siendo enfermera.\nPor esto le gustar\u00eda ser como un angelito blanco como es su vestido de enfermera que representa el amor y el servicio por el otro.\nLuisa se ha esforzado por sacar a sus dos peque\u00f1os hijos a delante a pesar de las adversas circunstancias econ\u00f3micas y de las duras pruebas que ha tenido que atravesar siendo madre cabeza de familia.

She can always dream because dreams do not have a limit nor have a point of arrival, as they are driven by the strength of the heart and feed the soul's hopes, as such Andrea believes that the more difficult it seems to reach the end goal, the greater the reward for so much effort."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1419346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to study Cosmetics in Campoalto.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-30T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-29T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1051600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":2,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1051600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.22,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":141181.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539983},{"amount":353.03,"local_amount":675000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-25T09:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":680697.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752522},{"amount":123.75,"local_amount":236600,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":238597.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845843}],"funded_date":"2013-08-30T20:56:12Z","paid_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":600955,"name":"Elian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elian es un hombre de 60 a\u00f1os que vive en Santa Rosa de la Palmera, es casado y tiene dos hijos, desde hace 3 a\u00f1os \u00e9l se dedica a la venta de huevos, la idea surgi\u00f3 cuando Elian trabajaba como transportista en su comunidad, en vista de la gran cantidad de personas que se dedicaban a la misma actividad (transportistas), entonces decidi\u00f3 empezar a comprar huevos a productores y distribuirlos con su veh\u00edculo en la comunidad.\nEl se\u00f1or Elian empez\u00f3 su negocio vendiendo 40 cartones de huevos por semana y actualmente distribuye 400 cartones en 4 d\u00edas. \n\u00c9l desea obtener este cr\u00e9dito para mejorar su veh\u00edculo, ya que este es fundamental para realizar la distribuci\u00f3n de los huevos diariamente, poder desarrollar de una mejor forma su actividad y mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su familia.

He is married and has two children. For three years now he has made a living selling eggs. Elian got the idea when he was working in transportation in his community. Since there were already so many people working in the same business (transportation) he decided to start buying eggs from farmers and distributing them in the community from his car. His wife makes a living as a domestic worker and one of his children is in construction.\r\n\r\nElian began his business selling 40 cartons of eggs a week and now he distributes 400 cartons in 4 days. He would like this loan to make improvements to his car as it is fundamental in carrying out the daily distribution of eggs and will enable him to develop a better structure for his business. It will also improve the quality of his and his family's lives. At this time he distributes eggs in 16 nearby communities. He sells to people at their homes, as well as to 2 shops, however, with the improvements to his car he hopes to be able to start another sales route and increase his income with new customers. \r\n\r\nThis work makes Elian feel proud as the product he delivers is very useful to his customers. He delivers right to the doorstep of each customer and his prices are much lower than those at the supermarket. This makes his customers happy with the service he offers. Elian would like to get this loan to be able to increase his income and give his family a better quality of

Therefore Dipanjali formed a group with five other members of her village to access loans from Mahashakti Foundation. From this loan amount of 10,000 INR she wants to purchase items like lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc. Dipanjali hopes this will help her to increase her income to make her dreams of construction of a house, purchasing a bike and better education of her only child come true.\r\n \r\nThe other five borrowers of the group are Kunti with a general shop business and Belmati, Ratna, Sadei and Sita with milk businesses. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1417211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KALSAIPALI, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-08-30T17:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-29T17:50:08Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dipanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belmati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ratna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":64000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":64000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T06:16:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":599887,"name":"Jerame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of two children, Jerame works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business buying and selling ready-to-wear clothing in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from raising pigs.

2010 by five women members of Below Poverty Line category from the village Kalsaipali in the district of Bolangir in Odisha; India to access loans from Mahashakti Foundation. Kalsaipali is a small rural village located five kilometers away from the district headquarters of Balangir.  All households of this village belong to the milkman community and their main income source is milk selling, along with cultivation. Sankar is one of the members of this group. She is standing second from the right with raised hand in the photo. She is 44 years old; living with her husband and two sons aged 18 & 12 years. \r\n\r\nSankar is running her conventional business of milk selling, having five cows. She gets 15 liters of milk per day. Her husband supplies this milk to the households of the railway colony of the town. Apart from this her family cultivates vegetables in the backyard and her elder son has been running a mobile phone repair centre at Balangir town for the last two years. From the above businesses Sankar gets a monthly income of 10,000 INR. But according to Sankar, the present income is insufficient and she faces lots of financial troubles in covering fodder expenses, investment in the mobile repair center and household expenses.  So, as there is growing demand for milk in the locality, she has planned to utilize the present loan for purchasing another cow of improved variety to add some extra income to her family.
