and married and, together with her husband, raising three children. She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she started 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 200 KGS. Thanks to Kulbaira's hard work, her farm now includes one milk cow and three sheep as well as one hectare of agricultural land on which she grows barley every year. Her monthly earnings amount to 6,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further development of her farm, Kulbaira has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to augment her number of cattle by purchasing cows. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing her quantity of cattle, and in addition to save for home renovations.

Ismail runs a small-scale agricultural business. In particular, he owns a citrus garden and a small dairy farm with two milk cows. Ismail and his family members work hard all day long to earn their living but their existing income is not enough to cover food and the every day expenses of such a large family. \r\n\r\nThat is why Ismail decided to start his own business. All of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Ismail applied for the credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva. This program enables the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $2200 will help him to purchase a minibus, pay the duty for it, and install the seats. He will work on the minibus line and transport the passengers. The new business initiative will significantly increase the family funds.  With the increased income, he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family members.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1417524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a minibus, pay the duty for it, and install seats to work on a minibus line","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhalsheni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-30T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-29T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismail","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":75.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":75.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":98.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":102.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":113.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":599939,"name":"Joryvic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joryvic is 19 years old and married with two children.

Her long-term goal is to one day open a store front.  As her business expands, Shaundrial expects to create more jobs.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Shaundrial needs to purchase more inventory.

The Accion loan allowed Shaundrial to pay for the maintenance of her website, www.adoresboutique.com.

This is her story.\n\nMy name is Saadat. I have a strong desire to study at the American University of Central Asia and am happy to be enrolled in the International and Comparative Politics Department. \n\nWhen I was a child, my family moved to Bishkek. It was quite difficult for me to get used to a new school, new people and environment, although not much later I became a leader of our class and started participating in the social life of our school actively. One of those was an event called \u201cYoung Traffic Wardens.\u201d It was the most interesting activity I was ever involved in, because I was the leader of that team and had to make decisions quickly, which was a very good experience for me. \n\nI took part in another project called \u201cEfficient use of water in schools.\u201d It was the first experience with such a meaningful project. We have done a great job with my team preparing presentations as well as giving other administrative support to the project events. During the implementation of this project we met with such international organizations as OSCE and the Japanese Embassy. We had lots of discussions regarding that project and English proficiency helped us as much as practicing it. Likewise, I am one of the members of our school Parliament, where we organize different social events, such as competitions, concerts, etc.\n\nAll the above-mentioned experience makes me more confident to take an active part in extracurricular activities of AUCA in the future and do all my best to make a good contribution to the social life of AUCA. Moreover, my educational background will help me to learn new things easily.\n\nBut to pursue my degree at AUCA I need financial support from Kiva because I live in a family of seven, my parents and four siblings, where my father is the only breadwinner. He helps my grandfather in agriculture, which means that this is a seasonal work, so my father can\u2019t afford covering the tuition fees fully. \n\nThe reason I am applying for financial support is that I am the eldest child in the family. My two other siblings also study: my sister is becoming a student this year, and my brother is in eighth grade in high school. So financial aid would greatly help me to be more concentrated on the studies rather on how to earn money and cover my tuition fees.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1416957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story.\n\nMy name is Marzhana. I have finished high school with golden medal this year. Only merit students are awarded the golden medal in the Kyrgyz Republic. I had excellent scores during my studies at high school and therefore I have been awarded the Diploma of Excellence each academic year. \n\nMy strong educational background gave me an opportunity to succeed in entrance exams to AUCA's Business Law Department. \n\nI also took an active part in social life: In 2005 I was attending an art school, where I learned drawing very well. In 2007 I attended at the School of Music, where I learned vocal. I also have experience in dancing, and eventually I became an instructor at one of the dancing clubs, Let\u2019s Dance Studio. As AUCA gives a good opportunity to take part in social and extracurricular activities, my experience will allow me to play an active role in it.\n\nAt our school there also was an organized club of debaters, where I took an active part. As a result I was awarded the title \u201cThe best debater of the school.\u201d\n\nI am sure all the above-mentioned experience I gained during my studies will give me an opportunity to become a valuable student at AUCA. \n\nI live in a family of four: my mother, my sister, my cousin and I. The only breadwinner of my family is my mother. She works at the Ministry of Justice. My older sister is also a student and studies at the National University of Kyrgyz Republic. Her studies are also expensive, so it would be difficult for my mother to fully cover my tuition fees. My cousin, whose mother lives and works in Moscow, also lives with us, and my mother is the one taking care of him. He is a student of eighth grade. \n\nI believe that American University of Central Asia is my future and I hope to get a financial support, which will allow me to cover my tuition fees.

However, for me it wasn\u2019t a difficult task since I had already decided that AUCA is the best place for my higher education. It is obvious that this university is one of the most prestigious, not only in our country, but also in the whole Central Asia.\n\nI learned about AUCA when I was only in seventh grade. I decided to enroll at AUCA after high school. Since then I improved the level of my English language proficiency, because this is one of requirements of AUCA. \n\nI think I fully meet AUCA requirements and really hope to get financial aid from Kiva, because it is unaffordable for my family to cover it fully.\n\nAs far as I know, the student life of AUCA is very vivacious and interesting. I am the one who always takes part in social life. I think I will be able to contribute to the social life of AUCA, making it more colorful and enjoyable, which will be a very good experience for me too. Moreover, I am a very diligent and determined student, and I am sure that I will be able to learn new subjects without any difficulties.\n\nNow I am on the final step to reach my goal.

Since AUCA is accredited by Bard College, students get American diplomas.\n \nIt is difficult for my family to cover the tuition fee, though. My family paid for my brother to attend AUCA. It is very hard for them to find more money for my studies. As the second child, I don\u2019t have as many opportunities, but I still want the best education I can get. \n\nThe other argument would be my promise to the university that I will meet the expectations of the university. I will not limit myself only by studying, but also actively take part in the social life of AUCA. I am a creative, emotionally stable and very active person. I consider these skills very important for extracurricular activities of AUCA. I know that the university has a lot of extracurricular activities where I will have a chance to demonstrate my skills and abilities.\n\nI was a very active student at school. I was a member of pupillary senate where I got good grades, studied French and was engaged in sports.\nMy mother always talks about the importance of education. Therefore I always tried to be one of the best students at high school, which gave me a chance to enter AUCA. I would much appreciate financial support to pursue my studies.

But she doesn\u2019t want money to stop her from her studies.\n \nAidai tries to be helpful to her parents and save money to partially cover her tuition fees, and this summer she is planning to work as a tourist guide for foreigners, which is also a good opportunity and experience for English speaking students. A Kiva loan would let Aidai be more concentrated on her studies, not on thinking about how to earn money for her tuition. \n\nThe American University of Central Asia has been the university of her dreams for years and she doesn\u2019t want financial restrictions to be a barrier for her future success.

His wife works at the local bookstore. He owns a vineyard and farms maize. He also has two milk cows whose milk he sells to cheese makers. \r\n<p>\r\nSeveral months ago Irakli decided to start importing cars to sell to supplement his income. His loan applications were rejected by local financial institutions because he lacks experience with new business start-ups and does not qualify for a traditional loan due to income requirements. \r\n<p>\r\nIrakli is now applying for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisions providing start-up and re-startup loans with easy terms to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as high-risk borrowers due to low incomes. \r\n<p>\r\nIrakli will use his 5,000 USD loan to buy cars abroad and resell them in Georgia at a mark-up.

She has a higher pedagogical education and at the moment she works as a mentor in a kindergarten.  As an extra source of income for her family, Venera is involved in raising livestock.  She started ten years ago with the purchase of animals for 15,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, her farm now has one dairy cow, 38 sheep and one stallion.

years old and she is married with four children.  She has a high school education and she raises livestock as the main source of income for her family.  She started 24 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 3,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, Tursunay now has two dairy cows and 15 sheep on her farm.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Tursunay turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to fatten and resell.  She plans to reinvest the income from this loan back into her business by further increasing her head of livestock, and she plans to save up money to make repairs to her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1416994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

is 50 year-old Asiatu.  She is single, and has no child.  In 2005, Asiatu established her commercial plastic shoe business. She began her business because she wanted to be self supportive. Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

She is a member of Kasenyi United group and has been a member of the group for the last five years. She is in the fishing business which she started doing in the year 1994 and she was very optimistic that the business would grow and fetch enough money as profits. \n\nMonika picked interest in the business because it was the most rewarding business in the area since they are near a lake. The business is located in Kasenyi, near the landing site in Kasese District. She gives this business enough time and on average, she gives it eight hours in a day and while off the fishing business, she attends to a bar which is her other source of income. She plans to use the loan money (5,000,000 uganda shillings) for buying fish nets and boats so that she is able to catch more fish and have increased sales and hence high profits. \n\nHer clients are people from Kasese and those in far off areas since she takes the fish to other places for sale. For the time she has been in the fishing Industry, Monika says her main challenge has been transport which is really poor since the roads are bad and this increases the transport fares and in the long run cuts her profits. Her other challenge, is the influence from the government since it some times bars them (fishermen) from fishing in that lake. \n\nHowever despite the challenges, Monika says she will keep being the hard-working person she has always been so that she one day owns a plot of land. She thanks Ugafode and Kiva lenders for the support they have been giving to the group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6050,"image":{"id":1411697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fishing nets and boats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-30T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-29T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":6050,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elnest","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Idi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Latif","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djibriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":15500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":6050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2583333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1008.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1008.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1008.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1008.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1008.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1008.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1008.33,"local_amount":2583333,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2588551.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880164},{"amount":1008.34,"local_amount":2583334,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2588552.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983825},{"amount":1008.33,"local_amount":2583332.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2588551.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635917},{"amount":1008.33,"local_amount":2583333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2588551.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863355},{"amount":1008.34,"local_amount":2583333.68,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2588552.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752433},{"amount":1008.33,"local_amount":2583333,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2588551.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233423}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T11:15:59Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":600110,"name":"Lilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilia is 57 years old and widowed.

She has worked from a very young age.  She used to have to wake up very early to prepare meals for her father and siblings for when they went out to work.  She then had to help her mother with household chores.  At 18 years old, Guapalupe married and started working in agriculture with her husband.  From this marriage, Guadalupe has had six children and, with a lot of effort, she was able to provide them only with a primary education.  All six children now have partners and have left home.  Guadalupe receives very little help from her children.  Guadalupe also has an adopted daughter.\r\n\r\nAlongside her husband, Guadalupe works in agriculture, sowing corn and jicama on 7000 square metres of land.  Guadalupe and her husband first planted the crops when they first married.

As a child he was given away to an unrelated couple because his parents were not able to raise him. His adoptive family treated him as their own son. They had few financial resources, but what was important was that they raised him to be an honorable person.\r\n\r\nWhen he was 12 years old he was working as a day laborer in the corn fields. At the age of 20, he married and had a daughter. Today, she has a partner and lives quite far from him. His wife died six years ago and he is alone. \r\n\r\nModesto continues working. He cultivates 7,000 sq. meters of corn. The person who showed him how was the boss he had when he was 12 years old because he has engaged in this work since that time. He also raises cows and hires out as a day laborer in the area around his house. He works on a hillside two kilometers from his house. He has to get up at dawn because he milks a certain number of cows owned by a cattle breeder in the area. Afterwards, he goes to his corn fields where he works the soil. Later he returns to take care of the animals he has at home.\r\n\r\nFunds from the loan will be used to purchase agricultural supplies, such as compost and fertilizer and to pay lads to help prepare the land to cultivate 7,000 sq. meters of corn. In the future, he wants to buy milk cows so that they can be used to accumulate savings for his old age.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1420180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase compost and fertilizer,  pay youths and prepare the land to cultivate 7,000 sq. meters of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-31T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-30T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903327}],"funded_date":"2013-08-31T07:15:25Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":600131,"name":"Litchel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Litchel works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fishing business in the Philippines and earns additional income from food vending.

She only studied until the seventh grade, since she did not have the opportunity to continue her studies because she dedicated herself to housework. She has spent one year working to raise and fatten chickens, a job she learned because of the need for an income and the lack of jobs in her country. To raise her chickens, she has built a gallery on the patio of her house with  metal sheets and old wood, but it is sufficient with the water and food troughs. She feeds her chickens everyday, and she provides them with clean water with antibiotics and vitamins to ensure that the chickens do not get sick. She sells the chickens to large businessmen in the markets in the city, and for others, she brings the chickens to their houses.\r\n\r\nTo buy her chicks, she travels by bus, which passes through her neighborhood. The trip takes almost an hour. She always buys from agricultural service centers, since they sell good-quality chicks at a good price.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requested is to buy 200 chicks for fattening and 15 sacks of feed, including pellets, vitamins, antibiotics, and other things. In this way, she will continue to offer low prices; will avoid many trips to the city, since they are difficult; and will always have living chickens to meet the demands of her clients.\r\n\r\nHaving a gallery always full of chickens will ensure her income, which will help her to continue growing her business and the security of her family. She dreams of expanding her business so that her daughters can have an education and their own

Iroda loves spending time with her daughters, and since they do not go to preschool, Iroda raises them by herself, teaches them how to draw, to do play-dough and recite nursery rhymes.  Iroda herself has a secondary education.\r\n\r\nIroda's husband works as a master mechanic at a technical service station.  Iroda and her husband have a very good relationship, they understand each other very well and always support each other.\r\n\r\nIn order to help her husband, and to bring some money home, Iroda has become involved in her own small business.  She buys and sells children's clothing and shoes at the local clothing market.  Thanks to this business, she makes quite a good income income, which constitutes the family's main source of revenue.\r\n\r\nAs an additional source of income for the family, Iroda and her husband also fatten a few head of cattle for future resale. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is her clothing retail business that Iroda currently wants to develop.  With the autumn season approaching, it is now time to sell fall clothing as well as children's school uniforms.  For this reason, Iroda would like to increase her inventory and expand her business.  She has turned to MDO Arvand and requested a loan to buy children's school clothes.  She really hopes to get a positive result and thanks her lenders in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1411877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

There are seven other members who also will invest their portion of the loan in agriculture and fishing.\r\n\r\nGloria is an enterprising woman who has the motivation and the capacity to identify the needs of her community. And  organize the resources for those who need them and make them into an economic activity that makes money. Her main activity is growing vegetables, totally organic, which produces a superior quality product. She has achieved this thanks to two previous loans that she got through Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nThis loan, as with the past loans, will be used to buy seeds, other types of plants to reproduce, bags, containers to prepare the organic fertilizer, special sand, a special type of large sized plastic to cover the plants and other supplies for her crops. Gloria will sell them in her community and also to middlemen who will sell them in other areas.

","en":"Nigora is a young, attractive, energetic and cheerful woman of 41. She is married and a mother to three children. Their family gets along well. Nigora's husband works as a foreman. It is his primary income but his work is seasonal and in the summertime Usmon's work doubles. Nigora's children are already grown up.\r\n\r\nNigora herself has been working in retail for more than eight years. She and Usmon leave for work in the morning and by evening come home tired, but their children try to help in everything, and their parents are happy in this. Nigora loves to socialize and has a large circle of friends. Despite her employment, Nigora works to devote her precious time to her nearest and dearest. These personality traits support Nigora in her vital activities. \r\n\r\nAt first, Nigora had a little shop where she sold household goods, but after a few years she broadened her inventory. At the present moment she sells furniture. On hot summer days, when our tasty fruits ripen - watermelon, cantaloupe, various types of grapes, peaches - the wedding functions begin. And a summer table increases the beauty of a wedding function even more. Due to this, Nigora needs to diversify her goods, as the primary gift for newlyweds is furniture. Nigora wants to fill out her selection of merchandise, and needs to purchase more diverse and interesting furniture. For this she requires monetary resources, due to which she has turned to Arvand requesting a loan to purchase furniture. She hopes for your support and conveys her thanks to Kiva and Arvand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1411745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Her shop is located at one of the arcades of the central market. Soon the school year will begin and sales will go up, which is why she needs to replenish her stocks and buy children's clothing for school, in high demand now. \r\nIn addition, she has many competitors at the market, and needs to offer higher quality goods as compared to the goods of other vendors working in her vicinity. With this goal, Inoyat has applied to Arvand for a loan to buy children\u2019s school clothing for later resale. She hopes for Arvand\u2019s support in developing her business and thanks Arvand in advance for its financial support. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1416360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy  clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-08-31T02:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-30T02:00:37Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inoyat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":162.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":165.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":169.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":173.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":177.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":181.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":185.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":190.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":194.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":198.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":600143,"name":"May","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"May is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her father appears in the photo inside their new home. \r\n\r\nMay is a 19-year-old single lady from Qalqilia.

He didn\u2019t attend school, because during his childhood there wasn\u2019t much access to schooling in the country. Another reason he wasn\u2019t able to study was that his family was large (8 siblings), with scant economic resources and they had to help their father with the farming in order to have food to eat daily. Eriberto is married and his spouse works selling tamales. Their children have already moved away and have their own families. His household is currently made up of his wife and him.\r\n\r\nBefore he raised grew staple crops (corn, beans and sorghum).  For the past 15 years, besides growing, he also buys and sells those staple foods on market days in town, looking to get a better profit margin than he gets by just cultivating his parcel of land. He also has a pig nursery. His wife, and occasionally one of his children, help him in these jobs.\r\n\r\nHe needs to buy 4 silos to store the staples and be able to sell them when they are at a better price. Without the silos, losses have occurred due to not having proper conditions in the rainy season. With their purchase, he will ensure his stock and will get more benefit from his business.  This will mean that he can count on the necessary means for the daily expenses of his family.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to be able to be part of a co-op that has a collection center and is dedicated to the purchase and sale of staples. He has a vision of helping the small farmers in town with better prices for their production, and that the organization would be profitable and sustainable."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1420246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 4 silos for storing harvested crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-31T03:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-30T03:00:25Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eriberto Alonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":35.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":36.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":40.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":42.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":47.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.11,"local_amount":35.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":35.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090899},{"amount":37.13,"local_amount":37.13,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":37.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856896},{"amount":37.97,"local_amount":37.97,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":37.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505163},{"amount":38.62,"local_amount":38.62,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":38.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716245},{"amount":40.55,"local_amount":40.55,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":40.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621877},{"amount":42.15,"local_amount":42.15,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088116},{"amount":43.52,"local_amount":43.52,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":43.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902384},{"amount":44.53,"local_amount":44.53,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":44.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215587},{"amount":46.47,"local_amount":46.47,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":46.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817005},{"amount":33.95,"local_amount":33.95,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":33.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242492}],"funded_date":"2013-08-31T20:41:01Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":600146,"name":"Wadhah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wadhah is 30 years old.

It currently brings together more than 3,000 members, largely women and men located in various regions of Senegal. The goal of this EIG is to allow its members to carry out agricultural and piscatorial production businesses, general import-export trade, transportation, manufacturing, handicrafts, construction, the raising of livestock, mining, fishing transport, the exploitation of hydrocarbons, art, culture, printing, carpentry services, public interest projects, representation, the processing of fishery products, farming, the sale of spare parts, ice-making, baking, and the delivery of services. The group is represented nationally by Mrs. Ramatoulaye, who signed a memorandum of understanding with UIMCEC as part of the financing of the group's members, which will allow them to acquire the material and financial means necessary to grow their businesses.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh Gpe 44 Group is a sub-lending group of the EIG, made up of 10 women represented by Mareme (the lady with her hand raised in the photo). They live in the same area and are all advancing in the same business sector.\r\n\r\nMareme is a married woman who has been working in trade for more than 30 years, selling fabric and other various goods. She also devotes herself to fashion. The profits her businesses provide allow her to contribute to the management of daily expenses at home, in support of her husband. She begins work at 8am every day and finishes at 4pm.\r\n\r\nMareme is a member of a local branch of UIMCEC, where she is seeking a loan with the goal of increasing her working capital in order to better grow her business in trade. She wishes to purchase foodstuffs (potatoes, onions, and dried fish, which will be sold).

Zuurakan plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of the headcount of her livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1418322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nichkesai village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-31T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-30T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zuurakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":600196,"name":"Paulina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A $600 loan is being offered to Paulina to improve her business.

When asked how this loan would benefit his family, Zachary replied, \"Improve our lives.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

He has three children and has been doing this work for six years.

But his farm is fairly far away and he has to travel approximately 8 km by bicycle.\r\n\r\nHe needs the money to buy a motorcycle, given that it's very difficult to have to pedal his bicycle such a long distance and do this every day. The loan will make a means of transport available that will permit him to be more efficient in his work and have more time to work and also for his family.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to be able to buy a plot of land near his house and not have to travel so far. He would have a place to grow and do a little bit of cattle raising. It's certain that it is not necessary to have to emigrate to other countries, if here in his country he can make his life decently."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1420395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorcycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-31T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-30T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime Ofilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":68.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":71.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":76.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":77.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.47},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":86.65},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":93.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Martin","image":1188596}},{"id":601331,"name":"2 De Febrero Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201c2 DE FEBRERO\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el trig\u00e9simo ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Villa Adela, est\u00e1 compuesta por doce integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Martha es la Presidenta.

This, in turn, led her to start her own workshop. She needs the loan to buy more wool from the wholesale shops in the town of El Alto. After making the plaids, she will sell them from her stall. The income Flora derives from this business goes towards paying for household expenses, as she is single with two children.

He is a charismatic man who is  committed to his work, and is honest and very dynamic.

Comprised of nine members, it is directed by a board, with Karina as president. The members have different businesses, such as: selling mobile phones, selling beds, selling fruit, making plaids, selling food, selling potatoes, and selling fried chicken. This loan will thus benefit a group of small entrepreneurs. Karina has worked with the field partner for six years. She discovered it through a neighbour who is also a member, and who invited her and told her about the work of Pro Mujer. She owns a sewing and clothes-selling business, which she started several years ago. She learned the trade at a technical school and has been practicing it since she graduated.

They both work as farmers, growing local crops such as organic cacao and coffee, which are the most profitable to grow in their area.

Part of the land she owns was inherited from her father, and thanks to what it produced she managed to buy another field of one hectare and a half, which she used to grow more cacao plants. Edy likes to tend to her crops and she is very careful to avoid a repeat of the rot that plagued her crops some time ago and was catastrophic for her earnings. Edy has been a farmer for over twenty years and has always faced the challenge of transporting heavy sacks of cocoa beans to the locations where she can sell them and hope to earn more than she invested. While her husband does help with the fields, she also needs to hire extra help for the harvest and the weeding, which needs to be done frequently. This is her first loan through Kiva and she is very grateful to the lenders and their financial support. She promises to pay back on time.

They live in Ceiba, Atl\u00e1ntida.  For many years, he worked for a government institution and had a home business, selling merchandise.  However, being unemployed, he decided to close it and established another business that he manages with his wife.  They sell food products such as rice, sugar, beans, eggs, and other groceries as well as plastic products and low-cost consumer goods.  The business has been in operation for a year and is located on the premises of one of the local markets.

This group consists of eight members and is led by a Board of Directors in which Sra. Nancy serves as the secretary.  The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as selling groceries, knitting baby clothes, selling cosmetics, selling gifts, selling coca leaves, and selling ESIKA products.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Nancy.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer seven months ago after receiving an invitation from a relative who is a member of the organization.  Nancy currently has a business of knitting blankets and stockings.  She started this business years ago after a group of mothers invited her to learn knitting techniques.  The products they make are exported to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying wool, which she acquires from the wholesale shops in the city of El Alto.  She uses the material for making the products that are ordered by an exporter.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income to sustain her household.

Kasaija hopes to pay back the loan after brewing waragi from his sugar cane and selling his coffee.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to educate the children so that they can have a bright future, but he is challenged by his limited income and the changing weather that affects his agricultural production.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1418602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"To pay tuition for his children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kagadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-31T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-30T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kasaija","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":116667,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":118087.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880222},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":116666.34,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":118087.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983881},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":118087.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635972},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":116666.99,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":118087.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863408},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":116666.35,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":118087.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752483},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":118087.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233470}],"funded_date":"2013-09-01T01:14:34Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:55:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":601390,"name":"Mercedes Bersabe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes no pudo estudiar, manifiesta que nunca conoci\u00f3 a  su padre y que tuvo que criarse con su abuela.
