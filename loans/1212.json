He has been rendering taxi service to local people since 2007. His wife is a teacher at the university and studying for her doctorate degree. Their six-year-old daughter is a first year student at an elementary school. He is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, he wants to repair and insulate his house for the upcoming winter. The Mongolian winter is well known for its freezing cold and snowstorms.

Their elder son works as a house interior on contract with entities or individuals. She is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks, fiberglass and foam in order to renovate her old house. By doing so, her family will live in a comfortable and warm place where they don't need to burn a lot of coal for heating.

of Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (a portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. He, together with his wife, has been doing house interior decoration on contract with entities or individuals since 2007 and accumulated a vast amount of experience. This summer he began building a house in preparation for the incoming winter and completed 60% of the construction work. Due to lack of cash, he couldn't complete the house. So, he is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as bricks, concrete, planks, windows and hardwood floors. Living in the house is better than living in a ger in various ways such as comfort and warmth. The family will burn less coal for heating as they move to live in the house. Coal is the main source of air pollution in Mongolia and reduction in usage will be sure to contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

His elder daughter graduated this year with a bachelor's degree in finance and is currently seeking a job. His wife is unemployed and stays at home taking care of the household. His son studies engineering at the university on a scholarship. He is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT to purchase shingles and wallpaper in order to repair his house's roof and walls. Heavy raindrops ruined the roof and walls. After the repairs, his family will live in a comfortable and warm place. As winter is coming close, it is necessary to repair the house roof if he doesn't want to lose heat through the damaged roof.

She lives with her partner and her small 10-month-old son. Dinora is a very responsible mother and partner who looks out for the well-being of her house and her family. This is the reason she is asking for a loan through which she can have the money necessary to replace the roof on her house.

He lives with his wife in their own house, which is made of wood, since his children are adults and independent. He is a well known farmer in his area, thanks to the years of experience that he has in this work and because he is a neighbor. He came to his present town as a very small boy along with his family. They bought the agricultural land that he now posesses. With the passing of the years, the economic situation improved and allowed the farmers to increase their plantings of cacao, thanks to the increase in the price that the buyers in his area usually pay.\r\n\r\nNow he also raises barbasco, string beans, and fruit trees such as bananas and coconuts. By locating his plots of land in warm zones, he can achieve a good production of cacao; nevertheless, to obtain a good quality of his fruits he has to clean the weeds from among his plantings and fertilize his soil with organic compost. On more than one occasion, he hires local workers so that they can help him finish his work. When harvest time arrives, he doubles the number of workers so that they can help him and then take the crop to the sales centers in suitable bags. \r\n\r\nThanks to the money that he earned, he was able to help his children in their personal and professional development.

","en":"Sharif is a hardworking and happy man, who is 42 years old.  He is married and has three children.  He was born and raised in a rural area and lives there to this day.  Currently his children are grown.  Sharif's oldest son is abroad in the Russian Federation.  He left there for work because, according to the traditions of our country, the oldest son in the family must help his parents.  Sharif's wife is a very kind woman, caring mother and wife.  She works as a farmer in a field.  Despite the fact that Inobat practically does not have time for the household work, she, as a real rural woman, tries to take care of everything.  And her husband Sharif and children and all of the relatives are happy with her.  In order to provide for family's living, Sharif has been involved in his own business for a long time.  He fattens up small livestock.  Sharif started his business with a small turnover and a small quantity of livestock.  Because he liked this business and seeing that it was profitable, he decided to increase livestock quantities and expand his business.  However, he does not have enough money.

It is composed of eight members and it is directed by a board, of which Cristina is the President. The members of the communal bank have a variety of businesses. Among them are selling beds, selling fruit, making blankets, selling food, selling potatoes, and a grocery store.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they are taking out will benefit small microentrepreneurs, of which Cristina is one. She says that eighteen years ago she joined Pro Mujer, joining at the invitation of a neighbor who is a member of the institution and who spoke to her about the work they do. Currently she has a business arranging function rooms for social events; she started this business with her sister, but when she got married, she decided to establish her own business.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will now take out is to increase capital (buying ribbon) that she will acquire on the Peru - Bolivia border and subsequently use in function rooms that need it. This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family as much as possible, since she is married and has a son.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the loan area and the medical care.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1421041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy ribbon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-01T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-01T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adolfo Vicente\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora Madelen\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela Mabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariel Ines\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dajhane Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22768,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2585.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2655.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2727.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2801.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2877.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2956.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3126.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":384.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":406.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":417.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":453.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":759.55,"local_amount":5240.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5248.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153693},{"amount":395.34,"local_amount":2727.6,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2731.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615265},{"amount":406.09,"local_amount":2801.8,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2805.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736205},{"amount":417.14,"local_amount":2877.96,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2882.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641715},{"amount":428.45,"local_amount":2956.08,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2960.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108653},{"amount":440.27,"local_amount":3037.56,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3042.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923739},{"amount":453.16,"local_amount":3126.56,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3131.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144610}],"funded_date":"2013-09-30T18:24:53Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":600691,"name":"Jeremiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeremiah is 38 years old, married, and a father of three children.

She belongs to Bordemar Communal Bank, located in Castro, a community in Chilo\u00e9, in the Los Lagos region.  This communal bank has different areas, a few of which stand out: book sales, knitting, perfume sales, clothing sales, accessories, and jewelry.\r\n\r\nLea knits and makes crafts out of EVA foam and quilted cushions.  She started about 15 years ago and learned from her mother and aunts, because all of them knit.  She says it's in her blood.  She also has participated in a variety of workshops in which she has learned different techniques.  She says she hasn't had major problems because she has always been very organized with her money.\r\n\r\nWith the money she's requesting she plans to buy wool.  She'll also save a little because later, in November, people always ask her to make flowers out of EVA foam.\r\n\r\nShe's very happy, and sure that this new loan cycle will go very well for her because at the moment she already has a few customer requests.  What she has enjoyed most about being able to work with Fondo Esperanza is meeting people as responsible as she is and who support and help each

It is made up of eight members and is led by a directing board. Paulina is the president. The businesses that the group members have are varied. Among them are: selling fried food, making blankets, making traditional multi-layered skirts, growing potatoes and raising cattle, and having a food stand. The loan they will take out will benefit small business owners of which Paulina is one. She says that this is the first time that she has been part of Pro Mujer, joining by invitation of a family member who is part of the institution. Currently, she has a sewing business and sells \"polleras\", traditional multi-layered skirts. She learned this business from her mother when she helped in her workshop.

She has one jeepney (14-16 person capacity) which pays a boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Marilyn is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney.\r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams that her business will continue to expand and hopes for a good life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines to repel the invading Japanese forces. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1419106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay for spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-09-01T02:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-01T02:00:11Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":280,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":12436.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771608},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10364.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824650},{"amount":186.67,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8291.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478473}],"funded_date":"2013-09-01T05:03:39Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:51:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":600718,"name":"Johnny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Johnny is from the village of Mabbayad.

For 14 years, he has worked as an administrative assistant for the town council, always showing discipline and commitment to his work. To get to his workplace, he travels five blocks on bicycle. His work schedule is from 8:00 am until 4:00 pm. The loan that he is applying for is to buy cinderblocks, cement, sheet metal, and other materials to remodel his home.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaria Joyce operates a food stall.  In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 900 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan.  She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nMaria Joyce dreams to expand her business and hopes to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1419130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"  To pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken, vegetables and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-09-01T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-01T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":4799.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5330.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771609},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824651},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533.38,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":592.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478474}],"funded_date":"2013-09-01T09:25:29Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:51:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jim Lee","image":null}},{"id":600734,"name":"Vladik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vladik is from Jermuk town where he lives with his wife and father.

She is married to Romel and they have children.  She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nEdna operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living.  It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 900 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nEdna hopes for a business expansion and dreams to give her children a good life and education.

He lives with his brother in the small village of Chkhorotsku district. He has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Malkhaz was unable to study a professional career. He works hard on his family-owned agricultural land, growing maize. He also has 700 nut trees and 200 bay trees. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. As the family has only a seasonal income, Malkhaz decided to start his own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

His village was considered a picturesque place under the communist regime, continuing up until some point after the collapse of that regime. Schools arranged camping for the children, and residents from the nearby city considered the village as their weekend getaway destination. A beautiful small river divided the village almost in half, and very old maple trees offered shade to the visitors. The beauty that existed then, unfortunately, no longer exists.\r\n\r\nFor the past fifteen years, Ali has been selling fresh agricultural produce that grows on his land. Now, with this loan he wants to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nKindly note that Ali felt a bit uncomfortable having his photo taken in the midst of his growing produce.

This is her story: My name is Yanery and I am 22 years old. I live in the municipality of Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic, and come from a very low-income family. I am the second of nine siblings and the first one to attend university. I have always dreamed about becoming a doctor and imagined myself wearing a white and long robe. However, as I was growing up and looked around me, this dream seemed harder to achieve. My mother is a very hardworking woman, but did not have the resources to make it possible. She was a single mother and I never met my father, who left us when I was born. My mom had to get ahead by herself and I am grateful to God for her. She taught me to fight for what I want and to never give up. Thanks to these values, I was able to finish my secondary studies. It was not easy for me to go to school as I had to walk long distances with hot weather or sometimes rain. However, I knew what my goal was and I would fight to make my dream come true. I moved from my mother's house and lived with a friend of the family, which made it easier to attend classes. When I finished high-school I was both happy and sad. I was happy because I had moved one step forward and was closer to my dream of going to university, but I was sad because I was not able to be at the graduation party with the rest of my classmates or have photos taken, as my mother could not buy me a dress or pay for my graduation photo. \r\n\r\nI started working when I was very young, cleaning houses and taking care of kids. This is how I could attend university. I am currently studying my second year of Odontology, an area of Medicine that I really like, and my dream is to finish and to help many people. I have been able to cover tuition for these two years, but it is too hard now. I do not have a job right now, but still need to pay tuition for one semester, which is why I am requesting the loan. It would be a blessing to count on your help and to use my talent, knowledge and abilities to help people. I could put a smile on the faces of those that think there is no hope. \r\n\r\nI hope my story has moved you and that you will decide to bless me with your help.

Even though there are many large rivers in Borneo the situation is very much as in Samual Taylor Coleridge\u2019s Rime of the Ancient Mariner : \u201cWater, water, everywhere, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.\u201d \n\nAs Wahyu says it: \u201cThe people in my area need water that is clean and healthy. The river water here is of very bad quality. The water from the water company is also turbid, so that most people buy their water in large 19 liter bottles. This water also originates from the city water company. \u201c\n\nWahyu has been selling Nazava water filters for half a year now and he is has been very successful. \u201cI started this business by introducing and promoting the filters to co-workers, neighbors and people I know. Then their response was very good.  My first and second order of Nazava water filters were sold out immediately, there were even some people pre-ordering. \u201c, Wahyu adds.\n\nWahyu is very optimistic about his business:      \u201cProspects are very good for the Nazava water filter because the product is simple, cheap and easy and competition from other products is still very small and other products are more expensive. I believe based on my experience, that the product is needed by the community. I therefore wish to maximize sales distribution more broadly in order to encompass Central Kalimantan and South Kalimantan. \n\nI am very eager to fulfill the water filter market in South Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan that is still wide open, I will take advantage of the local print media, local TV, Internet networks and using \"Mouth to Mouth\" promotion.\u201d\n\nWith this loan Wahyu can buy up to 100 filters which help htem provide safe drinking water to around 500 people.

She lives in her own house that is made from adobe.  Nancy has worked in agriculture with her husband for more than 8 years growing organic cocoa, and this is her main source of income.  \r\n\r\nShe owns a parcel of land that she works on very carefully because she bought it with hard-earned money.

She is one of the founding members of the organization, and is an active member of the loan committee in her community.  She was married at age 24 and has 9 children; four of her children have emigrated to the United States out of the need for a better life.  She works together with her husband in agriculture (growing corn, beans and sorghum).  She completed the fourth grade in her community.  She comes from a family of 4 siblings (three males and one female), whose parents always taught them to work hard in order to get ahead.  She lives in her house wth her husband and 5 of her 9 children. Three of her children are students at the basic education level in their community, one is studying nursing in the city, and the other helps her with the household work and in her tailor shop. In 1996 she went to a clothing factory in the city, where she learned to make pants and shirts for men and women.  This helped her, so that she now makes uniforms for the students in six schools in neighboring communities.  Her daughter and three other people help her with this activity.  For almost two years she has worked growing vegetables (planting cucumbers, tomatoes, chilies, broccoli and other things).  She learned this trade through training and technical assistance that she has received through various organizations that work in agriculture. For this activity she needs to travel to the closest city to buy seeds, which takes about 30 minutes by urban transport.  The loan she is requesting is to buy fertilizer to grow the vegetables, which will cost $250.00, and to pay $150.00 for laborers.  She makes some plant-based fungicides herself in the community. She will also buy manure to grow corn and beans for $400.00, and pay the laborers $200.00. With this investment she will obtain better harvests and ensure that her family is fed.  Alejandra dreams of setting up a well-organized business in her community.  Her aspiration is also to support her children in their studies. It is for them that she works every day.

Gulbara has secondary education. As a main income for her family, Gulbara works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 28 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulbara's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows, one calf, four horses and she also has a plot of land of 2.15 hectares. Every year she grows beans, bell peppers, clover, potatoes and cabbage on this land. The monthly income is 17,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulbara turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of nitrate to work the land.

Gulsara has higher pedagogical education, and works at the village school as a Russian language teacher. Her husband is also a teacher. \r\n\r\nAs an additional income for her family, Gulsara works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulsara's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow, four bulls and also a plot of land of 2.20 hectares. Here she grows peppers, beans and clover every year. The monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulsara turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to increase the number of livestock through purchasing two heads of cattle. Gulsara plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock, and to save money for building a

M\u00e1ximina married very young and she and her husband were able to buy a two acre piece of land with which to support her family.  This is how she began producing organic cacao, using the knowledge she learned from her parents and having grown up in the fields.  This is where she learned the necessary techniques to obtain a commercial quality product which is more profitable from her region.\r\n\r\nShe got more motivated when she became a widow and was left with the responsibility of caring for her son, so she does her work with the help of other workers who weed and harvest.  At the end of the season, she dries the cacao nuts outdoors and takes them to large chocolate producers in a different city.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second Kiva loan and she is grateful for the financial support that she gets to help her get ahead.  She is also committed to making her payments on time.

She spent several months held captive by an illegal organization. When she regained her freedom, she saw the need to look for options that would allow her to advance on her own, because it was difficult for her to find work opportunities. This is why eight months ago she started her own business, a store where she sells things for babies, like toys, clothing, bottles, and other accessories. The establishment is located in a very commercial area and thanks to the route, it is well-recognized. She has the support of her mother and the income from her sales goes to meet her family's basic needs. Elizabeth has had to overcome many obstacles and difficult situations, like the winter season and the public safety problems that sometimes surface. It directly affects her sales and on a personal level, she still has to struggle with trauma as a consequence of the kidnapping. However, little by little, she has been able to recover and move forward. Currently, she is asking for a loan as support, to invest in the purchase of wholesale merchandise (clothing, toys, accessories, diapers) with interest in starting to stock up and increase her inventory for the upcoming Christmas season. Now costs are lower and she can buy more products, which will be reflected in the increase of her sales, and ultimately, her income. This way, she will be able to give her daughter greater comfort. She also hopes to achieve her dream of expanding her business, strengthening it so that it if profitable and sustainable over time, because she hopes to pass it to her daughter as a family tradition, with which they can improve their quality of life and enjoy it as a family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1421304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy stock wholesale (clothing, toys, accessories, diapers)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Yarumal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T01:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T01:10:17Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273436},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281005},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288783},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":296777},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304991},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":313433},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322109},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331025},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340188},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349604},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":359282},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369226},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379447},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389950},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400744}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":144.59,"local_amount":278054,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":280454.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807463},{"amount":294.81,"local_amount":566941,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":571834.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095547},{"amount":158.76,"local_amount":305308,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":307943.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074604},{"amount":316.22,"local_amount":608122,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":613371.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523401},{"amount":348.68,"local_amount":670529,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":676316.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227131},{"amount":1336.94,"local_amount":2571046,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2593238.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480244825}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T19:00:51Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:56:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":601034,"name":"Encarnacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Encarnacion is a Cagayana.

He is married and is the father of two children. He is retired, and with some savings he began his business, a store that sells paints, solvents, and accessories for finishing. He has equipment to make mixtures and obtain more tones and new colors. He has the help of two direct employees, and he enjoys recognition in different towns and metal-working shops in the region because of his specialty of paints for vehicles. He began his business a year ago and he works from Monday to Saturday from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. Victor did not have experience in this type of business, but he took advantage of the knowledge of his employees, who have been teaching him the different techniques and concepts needed. Now he is applying for the loan with the goal of investing it in the purchase of stock (paints, solvents) and buying fixed assets (mixing equipment). With this he will be able to offer his customers a greater variety of tones and colors and will provide better quality service, with which he will be able to continue being recognized, and this will be reflected in an increase in his sales and his income, which will allow him to position himself in the market and be more competitive. Victor dreams of setting up other branches in other towns in the region and generating more opportunities for employment. This will help him to improve the living conditions of his family and enjoy a prosperous and stable future."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1421308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy stock (paint, solvents) and fixed assets (mixing equipment)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Yarumal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T01:20:04Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"V\u00edctor Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149508},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153646},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157899},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162270},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166761},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171377},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176121},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180996},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186006},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191155},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196446},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201883},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207471},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213214},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219116},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225181},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231414},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237820},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244403},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251168},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258120},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265265},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272607},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280153}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.72},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":601037,"name":"Ariunbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Ariunbold, 34 years old, lives with his wife and two children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.
