","en":"Muhabbat is a homemaker and her children's only hope.  She is divorced and raises her two children by herself.  She completed secondary school, but was not able to go to a university because of her family situation.  Instead, she learned to cut and sew women's clothes from a seamstress, and she has now been involved in this activity for more than 15 years.

He was born and raised in a humble home in the country. There, he learned how to farm by hand from his parents, who worked their whole lives as farmers and day laborers. Thanks to this knowledge and family tradition, today Jos\u00e9 has corn crops that he tends to daily from 5 a.m. onward. He has overcame a number of obstacles that at times impact his production, for example the heavy rains that flood his fields and damage the crops. However, with his winning attitude, hard work and dedication he has been able to make headway. The income he earns comes from selling the goods he harvests, which has allowed him to bring home the daily bread. He currently is requesting a loan, which he plans to use to purchase wholesale supplies (fertilizers and insecticides) so he can improve his production for the upcoming harvest. He hopes to have excellent products that he can sell for a higher price at the market. Jos\u00e9's dream is to expand his crops and plant another kind of product to increase his income and give his family more economic stability and a higher quality of life, and so he can provide his young son with an excellent education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1421330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase wholesale supplies (fertilizers, insecticides).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Monter\u00eda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Gregorio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35698},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36686},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37702},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38745},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39818},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40920},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42052},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43216},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44413},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45642},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46905},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48203}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":19.63,"local_amount":35709,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":38095.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807466},{"amount":19.95,"local_amount":36269,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":38692.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095550},{"amount":20.73,"local_amount":37688,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40206.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074607},{"amount":214.69,"local_amount":390334,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":416416.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009801}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T02:08:24Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":601093,"name":"Mabomba Mengi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria, who is married with four children, is running a business selling different drinks such as beers, sodas, juices, and spirits for five years now.

He has been working in agriculture for 30 years. He learned this occupation from his parents when he was a child. Thanks to this, today he owns plots of yams and yucca where he works every day starting at 5 in the morning. He collects the harvest and sells it in the market of the town that he lives in.

The second is not studying but was in school up to the third grade. Both children, since they are no longer in school, are dedicated to supporting their father in his farming work. The two brothers who follow the eldest are in school in different grades of education and the last is a recently born baby. Idis has no education since her parents' economic situation was not the best. She learned to work the land from her parents, especially cultivating coffee, performing the different activities that one develops in the countryside like cleaning, fertilizing, pruning etc. for the development and care of the grain.

He could not continue studying because his family lacked economic resources and he had to work in agriculture in order to help his father bring food to the table. He is in a relationship; his partner takes care of the household chores. He says that he has a two-year-old son. He wants him to have the opportunity to study without all the obstacles that he faced.\r\n\r\nMauricio works growing corn and beans. He also works as an assistant to a mason, whenever there is an opportunity to work. He also raises pigs and sells them when they have reached the right weight in the town\u2019s marketplace. His father helps him sometimes, and he helps him in return. He works every day in his plantation and in the afternoon, he feeds the pigs.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy wood and metal sheets to fix his roof, which is in bad shape. Every time it rains, he has to be alert since the wind can blow it away. With the loan, he will have the resources on time in order to buy the materials he needs to improve his house and avoid its deterioration, since it is made of wattle and daub. His family will have a safer place to live in.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to have a decent house. For the moment, he will have to settle with some improvements. However, with hard work and some savings, he hopes to make his dream come true. Another dream he has is that his son can have the opportunity to study and to have a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1420420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood and metal sheets to repair his roof, which is in bad shape.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T12:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T12:30:20Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricio Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":30.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.06,"local_amount":61.06,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":61.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856901},{"amount":31.28,"local_amount":31.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":31.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505168},{"amount":176.6,"local_amount":176.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":176.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716249},{"amount":131.06,"local_amount":131.06,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":131.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088120}],"funded_date":"2013-10-02T09:33:59Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:12:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":601131,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is 40 years old and has six children.

Due to the poverty her parents lived in, she only went to school until the 7th grade. When she married she didn't have formal employment, and so she found the money to feed her family by breeding pigs. Three years ago she began to build pigsties with cement roofs and floors to provide better conditions for the pigs. Every morning she washes the floor of each pigsty and gives the pigs clean water and food. In the afternoon she does the same. Her pigs are purebred and she sells their piglets when they are one month old.\r\n\r\nRubenia buys her pigs from other farms with better breeds. She has to hire a pick-up to make the journey, which varies in price depending on the distance  she has to go to make the purchase. She is asking for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy six purebred pigs, which she will use as breeding stock. She will also be able to help other people to buy one or two piglets which they can raise to provide a source of income for their families.\r\n\r\nOnce Rubenia has a greater number of pigs, she will be able to increase her sales and earnings and give her family a better quality of life.

Mar\u00eda also has a pond where she raises shrimp and fish to sell to the neighbors in her community.\r\n\r\nThe loan Mar\u00eda's requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy two calved cows.

Her fourth child was born with her new husband, with whom she works in agriculture.  Her oldest son is 14 years old and is studying in the first common cycle.  During the week he lives with his paternal grandparents and on the weekends helps his mother with farming.  Her second and third children are 12 and 10 years old and attend school.  Her youngest daughter is 13 months old.  \r\n\r\nShe specializes in planting coffee since she learned to work the land with her parents since she was six years old.  Lately her husband has been supporting them more since she has been caring for the children, and especially the youngest, since her last pregnancy.

One does not live with her, he has gone to the United States. Another does not want to study and he works with his father. The youngest one is a student. She only studied until Grade Four. She had to quit studying after her father was killed in the war. She was left alone with her mother and she had to learn to do agricultural work in order to help her mother support their household. She learned this work from some neighbors who gave work to her mother and her siblings. Her father died when she was 10 and she started to work in the fields when she was 12 years old. \r\n\r\nBesides working in the fields Mar\u00eda has always liked raising livestock. Today she has 6 head of cattle and her dream is to have more. She gets up at 4:30 in the morning to prepare breakfast. Then she takes the cattle to their field. This done she is off to work in the cornfields, which is a 30 minute walk away.

She\u2019s paid for her services at the time she provides them which is why she works Monday to Sunday from 8 in the morning until 10 at night.\r\n\r\nShe makes her purchases at wholesale from large wholesalers that offer special prices and with whom she\u2019s established a good alliance that carries with it the opportunity to obtain products on special offer from them.\r\n\r\nHer main customers are local neighbors that have gotten to know her.  Her goal to reach is to become well-known in the city and later on to finish her schooling.  Her greatest challenge is insufficient working capital to be able to work with more flexibility in her business.  \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela is currently requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, by means of which she will make some physical improvements to her shop and will buy some supplies to open a new beauty salon to extend her personal and professional image beauty improvement services to other sectors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1421860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and to do location improvements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angella Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":56563},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65760},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":67733},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":69765},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":71858},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":74013},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76234},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78521},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80876},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83303},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85802},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88376},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91027},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":93758},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96571},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99468},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":102452},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":117920}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.22,"local_amount":56563,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":56855.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083107},{"amount":745.78,"local_amount":1443437,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1450902.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542523}],"funded_date":"2013-10-02T12:56:53Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":601263,"name":"Benedict","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benedict is a 30-year-old married man with two children aged 4 and 6 years old.

Before, she only cared for the home, but being alone, she saw the need to fight to move her children forward. She buys her products in the country's capital. She goes 20 minutes on foot to take the bus that goes to the city. She makes her purchase and then returns home, and goes out to sell from house to house in the nearby groups of houses. The loan will be used to buy four dozen bras, three dozen pairs of underwear, one dozen blouses, one dozen skirts, two dozen socks, bloomers, and suits for children. With the loan, she will be able to buy wholesale and more cheaply. She will travel less and have a better income. Her dream is to buy land to build a house. The place where she lives now belongs to her brother-in-law. She also dreams of seeing her children become professionals. With her earnings, she hopes to pay off the loan, to have door open to the foundation and save, in order to achieve her dream of having her own home in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1421780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She learned this activity thanks to her husband ten years ago.\r\n\r\nThe land her family works and grows on is their own thanks to the efforts and sacrifice they made in years past to produce excellent crops to sell.  In this way they were able to acquire it.  It\u2019s five minutes away from home so they get to it daily on foot.  One of her greatest challenges is increasing production and improving the quality of the soil to grow better varieties of coffee like Caturra which is the best and has the highest market price.\r\n\r\nHer plans are to obtain an excellent crop yield because that will improve her income.  She will reinvest in the coffee, corn and bean crops but especially in the coffee which is her greatest source of family and household income.\r\n\r\nThis is why she\u2019s currently requesting financing to prepare a piece of land for planting.  She will buy 10 quintals of 12-24-12, 11 quintals of 18-46-0, 5 quintals of Nuri-Caf\u00e9, 7 kilos of Manzate, 4 liters of Forticaf\u00e9 to better care for and maintain her crops thus obtaining the maximum possible in the upcoming harvest.\r\n\r\n       "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1421923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T18:40:10Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Natalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":0.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833742},{"amount":1.33,"local_amount":26.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":27.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710547},{"amount":5.02,"local_amount":100.47,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":102.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449616515},{"amount":0.63,"local_amount":12.69,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":12.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535653},{"amount":993,"local_amount":19859.83,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":20259.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624826989}],"funded_date":"2013-09-30T15:59:08Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T09:59:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":602159,"name":"Araceli","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Araceli es una mujer de 33 a\u00f1os de edad agricultora y ama de casa, madre de 3 hijos con un grado de educaci\u00f3n secundaria completa.

She is in her second loan cycle with a good repayment history.  \r\n\r\nAzra hopes to grow her business and dreams of providing a better standard of living to her family members through all her hard work in her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1419831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two more calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Mandi Bhauddin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-09-02T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-02T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Azra  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1769},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1821},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1874},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1985},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2043},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2103},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2165},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2228},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2293},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2360},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.69,"local_amount":1769,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1834.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410119491},{"amount":18.21,"local_amount":1821,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1888.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419884762},{"amount":18.74,"local_amount":1874,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1943.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429533326},{"amount":19.29,"local_amount":1929,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2000.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439757179},{"amount":19.85,"local_amount":1985,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2058.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449661613},{"amount":20.43,"local_amount":2043,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-21T08:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2118.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459907332},{"amount":21.03,"local_amount":2103,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2180.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467947182},{"amount":21.65,"local_amount":2165,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2245.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479167968},{"amount":93.11,"local_amount":9311,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9655.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490862084}],"funded_date":"2013-09-02T22:03:27Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T15:19:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":601422,"name":"Shugarkhuu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Shugarkhuu, 53 years old, lives with her husband in Darkhan, the second largest city of Mongolia.

His main profession is to decorate the cars and wedding beds for marriage ceremonies. In his area, he is very famous for his art. Most people like to decorate their cars and wedding beds from him. He has been running this business since 1970. The flower selling business is not a profitable business and their family barely fulfills their needs. Now the marriage season is going to start but he does not have sufficient stock of flowers to cope with the sudden increase in demand. Therefore, Rasheeda requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband  to buy more roses, jasmine and chrysanthemum flowers. Rasheeda hopes that this loan will bring positive changes to the business and in their lives.

She has a secondary education.  She is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this field 17 years ago when she bought livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work, Gulbara now owns two dairy cows, two young bulls, seven sheep and one horse.

with her husband.  She has a secondary education.  She is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business three years ago when she bought livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work, Eliza now owns one dairy cow, two young bulls and one horse.  She makes a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her farming business, Eliza has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy some calves and therefore increase her livestock headcount.  She plans to invest the earnings from this loan into further increasing her herd of domestic animals, and also intends to improve her family's material

His village is located in a remote area, where nature makes it possible for people to work in agriculture.  Abdulo is married and raising three children.  His wife is a homemaker, so he is the only breadwinner in his family.\r\n\r\nAbdulo has been buying and selling agricultural crops for more than ten years.  He has a good experience in his field of work and manages his business alone.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, he started to build a house for his family.  However, the house is not finished yet: there are a few things that need to be completed.  Abdulo is requesting a loan of 4,000 somoni to buy building materials such as cement and wood.

He needed to feed his family. Now Farukh is living with his mother, brothers, and sisters. His father went abroad to work. Farukh is divorced. The divorce wasn't easy, but it didn't break him. He decided to open his own shop and sell men's clothing. Farukh has a stall at the area market. He needs a bit more money to buy goods, so he is asking for a loan. He would like to use the funds to buy a variety of seasonal men's clothing. Everything he does is to improve his family's life. He doesn't want to leave his country again, and instead plans to advance and grow his new business.

coming from a large family who did the same. His family's economic situation was poor so he had to work to help his parents. He did not go to school and did not learn to read nor write. He married when he was 20 years old and along with his wife began to work for himself. This union produced four children and they formed their own family. \r\n\r\nHe grows vegetables on irrigated land in the summer. He has to get up quite early to do this as this plot is 10 kilometers from his house.  He has to keep close watch on it, staying there all day and if possible in the night too, in order to protect it from infestations and animals that come at night. He grows his corn closer to his home, one kilometer away. As he has also managed to rent land, he has to start very early and sometimes work all day. He also has two of his sons who help him work part of the land.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 will use the loan to buy agricultural supplies to buy fertilizer and manure, to pay for labor and to prepare the land to cultivate 14,000 square meters of corn. He plans to care for corn more in order to produce a more plentiful harvest. He says that in the future he wants to finish building his house, continue working and help his sons get more loans to work the land and use the revenues to complete the house."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1422137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and manure, to pay for labor and to prepare the land to cultivate 14,000 square meters of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-03T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-03T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Germ\u00e1n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":204.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":232.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":263.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":299.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":602201,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cylinder -

In addition to his main job, Malkhaz is involved in a small-scale agricultural business and owns two cows and a vineyard.\r\nAs the existing revenues are very small, the family decided to start a car import business to supplement his income, but his loan requests have been rejected several times by local financial institutions. He lacks experience with new business start-ups and does not qualify for a traditional loan under income requirements. Malkhaz is requesting a loan under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This loan program provides start-up and restart-up loans with reduced requirements for the rural poor who do not have access to many credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers.\" With the received loan, Malkhaz\u2019s son will purchase cars abroad and resell them in Georgia for a price mark-up.

She lives with her husband, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren in the Sagarejo district. Izolda and her husband are provided with retirement pension. The family is out of source of income. \r\n\r\nIzolda decided to start her own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. The Start-Up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. \r\n\r\nHer application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $700. With the received credit, she will open a bakery. She already owns a commercial party where she is going to open a bakery. She plans to purchase raw and building materials for the bakery.

She started the business using her own capital in the amount of 2,000,000 IDR (Indonesian rupiah) to buy two boxes of chicks, medicine for the chicks and the fodder. The income is used to fulfill the family needs. \r\n\r\nCurrently, there are 1,000 chicks in the stall, and she wants to purchase the fodder and also a better quality of medicine for the chicks, but she lacks the money to do so. Therefore, she asks for an individual loan from TLM in the amount of 3,000,000 IDR. The loan is spent to buy three boxes of the medicine and also the fodder for the chicks.

He requested credit to set up a cobbler shop. Vladimer used to work as a cobbler and has enough experience in this field. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country's vulnerable poor. They do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Vladimer will purchase leather materials and all the needed tools for shoe-making. He will also repair shoes and get a profit. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income for the family. Their living conditions will improve, and in the future they will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

He is very ambitious, which is why he has decided to request a loan to buy two more dairy cows to increase his daily output and increase the income he receives for selling milk. In this way, he can continue to help his family with their financial burden. The loan will also offer him the chance to keep fighting to achieve his medium-term dream of establishing a milk-producing business, so that he can offer jobs to others and improve his family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1422255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He speaks in a monotonous tone, which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town, which is the reason his business is working well. Due to his good relations, his sales have increased a lot but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Zahida requested a loan for her husband to buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits etc. Zahida hopes that her husband will use the loan in positive way and that it will help him to cope with the demand. Due to more sales, his profit will automatically increase and he would be able to make more savings for his family.

He lives with his wife and two children in a small village of Telavi district. His wife is a teacher and works at a local secondary school. Vladimer is actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular he has a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. He works hard and has high quality produce which is sold to local retailers for a good price. But as the income is only seasonal and is not enough for everyday expenses, Vladimer decided to get a loan and start his own business. He sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe start-up program that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial condition and lack of experience.  \r\n\r\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, Roin applied for the credit to MFO Credo.

Her elder brother works as a waiter at the local restaurant and her father is a cook. Both of the family members get small monthly wages. Nino's younger brother goes to secondary school.\r\n\r\nThe family owns a small plot of land and grows nuts for selling. The family lives under the poverty line and gets modest monthly social assistance from the government.\r\n\r\nAs their existing revenue is very small and is not enough to cover everyday expenses, Nino decided to start trading. She requested a loan from the local credit providers, but they usually demand some stable income from the borrowers. Nino's credit requests were rejected several times, as she didn't satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received this credit within the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, called the Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

She lives with her parents and works independently to generate income on her own in order to support her children. She assumes all of the economic responsibility for her family since the father of her children abandoned them. Her father has a business in which he sells jackets and Ecuadorian blankets; they are from Ecuador but they have been living in Colombia for 40 years. He gave her a small space within his shop so that she could start selling men's clothing, an activity that she alternates in the afternoon with selling fast food. She does all of this with the goal of generating the resources necessary to give her children daily sustenance and the opportunity to receive an education.\r\n\r\nFlor is a vigorous, persistant and very hard-working woman who works non-stop so that her children will want for nothing. This is the reason why she is applying for a loan: she will invest it in the purchase of merchandise in bulk (men's jeans, shirts, pants) and thus have more variety to offer and satisfy diverse tastes in clothing. This will be reflected in the increase of sales and profit. \r\n\r\nFlor dreams of seeing her business grow strong, stable, and well-recognized in the area, which over time will change her family's living conditions and she will be able to enjoy her children, the fruit of her hard work.
