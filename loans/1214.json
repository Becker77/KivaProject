More items to sell will result in better profit. She will use another part of the loan money to buy products for her direct selling business, and slippers to sell. Her profits from business will definitely help her to support herself. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of expanding her business and having more stalls. She hopes for strength and good health to continue working. She meets up with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The house they live in has been deteriorating for years so she decided to renovate and build an extension to her house. For this project, she is requesting a loan of 5000000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, planks and fiberglass as well as vacuum insulated windows and hardwood flooring. Using those materials, she and her husband will renovate and build an extension to their house before winter. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating thus releasing less pollutants into atmosphere.

Her 9-year-old daughter goes to elementary school. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of MNT 4,000,000 to purchase a low-pressure heater and roof shingles.  Last spring heavy rain damaged the house roof, so she and her husband will repair the roof using the shingles.  They will also install a low-pressure heater. As a result, they will burn less coal for heating, thus releasing fewer pollutants into atmosphere. Burning of coal is the main source of air pollution in Mongolia.

Jos\u00e9 himself has only studied up to the fifth year of middle school, but he would have liked very much to study \u201cAutomotive Mechanics\u201d.

Jos\u00e9 puts forth a lot of effort into his job as he works about 12 hours every day and attends about 80 customers. Jos\u00e9 tells us that every day is a good day because he is able to return home with money for household costs, which gives him a little peace at the end of the day. He believes that his business is going well because he has a lot of faith in God and that God guides him, and for this reason he always has something to take home because he is honest, honorable and respects his customers.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is actually very grateful for Kiva loans, as this is the third time that they have given him their support and with it he will be able to make improvements on his work vehicle, which is a mototaxi.

","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a 33-year-old man who has a 7 year-old-son.  He was born and bred in San Miguel but, security problems forced him to move with his family to a different place. They built their houses there in a space previously occupied by the Pan-American Highway.  For family and financial reasons he had only 4 years of primary education and now lives alone with his 7-year-old son as his partner left him for another man.  Jos\u00e9's mother lives close by and helps him with his son and does some of the housework while he does agricultural work (for himself or as a day worker) or works as builder's assistant because they are the main economic activities in the region. He works with his brother growing basic grains (corn) on a plot of land which was left unused after the state bank repossessed it.  Now the locals grow subsistence crops on the land which is 0.5 km away.  Jos\u00e9 buys his agricultural supplies in the city, which is a 10km bus-ride away, and then carries them on his back to the plot.   His son goes to the local school each morning and is in the first year of primary education.   The loan will be used to buy agricultural supplies (weed-killer and fertiliser) to sow 0.4 hectares of corn.  The aim is to use the corn to feed his family and to sell some to local tortilla sellers and thereby pay of the loan.  Jos\u00e9 hopes that the loan will enable him to produce enough grain for his family's consumption and to sell the rest to pay off the loan he has applied for.  His ambition is to see his son study for a professional career and to eventually free himself of his current commitments.  He has an existing loan from another institution which has to be repaid within two months.  He hopes to improve his living conditions and buy some furniture, as he currently only has the bare necessities.  Additionally, he does not have electricity and so having this installed is, perhaps, his most pressing need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1413879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy weed-killer and fertiliser to sow 0.4 hectares of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-03T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-03T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Danilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215551}],"funded_date":"2013-09-04T20:43:33Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":601781,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 38 years old and married to a farmer.

Hugo will keep working and striving to achieve his big dream, which is for his children to become good professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1418931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-09-03T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-03T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":69.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":71.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":75.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":77.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":99.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":102.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.19},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.07,"local_amount":64.19,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":67.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054766},{"amount":26.07,"local_amount":69.51,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":73.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819661},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":71.13,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":74.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472581},{"amount":28.2,"local_amount":75.19,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":79.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695055},{"amount":28.96,"local_amount":77.24,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":81.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450391077},{"amount":62.48,"local_amount":166.62,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":175.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067558},{"amount":156.84,"local_amount":418.23,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":440.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880467},{"amount":21.71,"local_amount":57.89,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T09:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":60.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530787556}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T14:37:28Z","paid_date":"2014-09-20T09:29:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":599160,"name":"Isidora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Isidora es una mujer de 38 a\u00f1os de edad casada, emprendedora y luchadora, madre de 5 hijos los cuales son menores de edad y est\u00e1n en la primaria en diferentes grados de educaci\u00f3n en una escuela de la comunidad.

husband's death and also running her own business.  Erkebu has a higher education.  She spent many long years working as a chemistry and biology teacher at a local school.  Erkebu has been involved in animal husbandry for 40 years, having started with a purchase of livestock with 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 1 horse, 2 dairy cows and also 20 heads of small livestock, and the monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Erkebu requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to increase livestock headcount by buying small livestock.  Erkebu plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of domestic livestock quantities.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1419768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kors-Etti village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-03T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-03T18:00:06Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erkebu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10124.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777192},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10124.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942591},{"amount":204.36,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10124.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.97,"payment_id":459019535},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10124.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053290},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10124.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178170},{"amount":206.48,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10124.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.85,"payment_id":529946809}],"funded_date":"2013-09-30T06:43:12Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":601856,"name":"Gayane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gayane lives in Goris town with her family.

As honey is a must-have item for each household of Armenia, it is very much in demand among locals.\r\n\r\nGayane works hard to gather high quality honey and sell it. Her family consists of 7 people: Gayane herself, her husband, parents-in-law and three children (two of them are school age).\r\n\r\nThe income from agriculture hardly helps Gayane to cover her family's basic needs, so she would like to enlarge it. Gayane took a loan from a local financial institution before and wasn't able to repay it because of the family's poor conditions. But over years of hard work, Gayane and her family were able to farm in a way which is sustainable enough for covering monthly payments. So, Gayane has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.\r\n\r\nThe second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products, so lenders will greatly assist Gayane by giving her an opportunity to purchase 5 more colonies of bees and 3

Her son is in kindergarten and her younger daughter is not old enough to study yet.\n\nGladis has the support of her brother who is in charge of caring for the crop, while she takes care of the financial resources in order to attend to them and give them the necessary and possible maintenance.

lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well-known market areas in Montserrado County. She is 48 years old, and she stopped her education at 7th grade. Sally is married and has three children, ages 17 to 30 years old. Only one child lives at home and is attending school. For the past sixteen years, Sally has been selling Lappa, which are African cloths used mostly by women, in the local market. One problem she faces is small income. She enjoys the interaction with her customers and the profit she makes every time. She is requesting a loan to purchase more Lappa for her business. In the near future, she hopes to build a house for her children. She thanks the lenders for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1414543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is very positive and hard-working, married, and has three children. She works as a nurse in one of the local clinics. Her salary is not very large, and because of this she tries to economize when possible so that there will be enough money to cover basic family needs. Zebo's husband is in Russia for work; he drives a taxi. This year Zebo's son will start university - he wants to become a financier. Zebo really wants her son to receive a better education and become the best specialist in his field. Zebo and her husband earned money and tried to save for their children's education, but not long ago Zebo married off her oldest son, and had to spend everything they saved on that special occasion. But now Zebo has no savings. She therefore turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to pay for her son's education, especially since the cost of education has risen significantly. Zebo nonetheless believes and hopes that she can give her son the opportunity to study and receive a higher education.  She also hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1301787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to pay for study","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-03T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-03T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zebo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":144.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":149.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":154.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":164.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":170.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":176.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":194.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":201.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":215.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":222.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":230.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":238.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":246.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":253.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.93,"local_amount":144.35,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":147.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136799},{"amount":31.98,"local_amount":149.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":152.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900997},{"amount":33.07,"local_amount":154.3,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":157.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550179},{"amount":34.18,"local_amount":159.53,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":162.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774402},{"amount":35.35,"local_amount":164.94,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":168.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673535},{"amount":36.54,"local_amount":170.53,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":174.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144322},{"amount":547.95,"local_amount":2557.11,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2611.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960144}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T18:32:06Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":602710,"name":"Ruben","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruben es casado, vive en casa de sus familiares  ubicada en la ciudad de El Alto.\nEl estudio hasta el nivel secundario.

children. He lives in a rented house, occupying alone a room with brick walls. The house is located in the city of La Paz. Currently he works as a fast food delivery employee for more than 10 hours a day. He makes deliveries on a motorcycle, running great risks trying to arrive on time with the orders. And with the little that he earns he has to cover his expenses for food, education, rent and pay for basic services. Consequently he is requesting a loan because he wants to take two rooms under an antichretic contract in order to save money.

She only studied until the second grade, since her parents were poor and didn't view education as important.  She is a single mother to two daughters, 19 and 15 years old.  Her life partner left her 12 years ago, and since then she has had to support her family.  One of her daughters works in a cafeteria, and the other is in the ninth grade.\n\nShe has worked in agriculture since she was around 12 years old, since she always helped her father planting corn.  Now she works on a farm doing the same thing.  She tells us that it pleases her father to have taught her to work.

Most of these are his own neighbors, and they in turn recommend him to other people, who over time become regular customers.\n\nHe began more than two years ago with a private loan, buying and selling in small quantities, which he is gradually increasing in accordance with demand, and so far he runs the business by himself. He also comments that he likes his business because he knows about agriculture, and he decided to start it because he needed to be able to rely on his own income and to have a trade, as the allowance for his children was not enough and he had financial problems.\n\nThis is first loan with Kiva and he is very happy to know that he has a financial support, as he now feels sure of making progress with his business.

As the income from the agriculture business is seasonal and is not enough for consuming, Gela decided to apply for a loan and start an animal husbandry business to generate income.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Gela will purchase calves. After purchasing livestock, he will raise them and sell them in the spring for a higher price. This will generate an income and the new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved within the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program aims to provide business start-up and re-startup credits with more favorable terms to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products because they are

For that Sughran is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell. So that he can respond quickly to customer needs.

This, along with his job as a manual laborer, will generate a stable income, thereby giving him a real opportunity to improve the living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1421586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a motorbike to transport wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Nasamkhrali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-09-04T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-04T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":47.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":53.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.07,"local_amount":37.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134370},{"amount":25.74,"local_amount":40.45,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":42.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107953},{"amount":26.18,"local_amount":41.15,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":43.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255487},{"amount":27.22,"local_amount":42.76,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":45.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019618},{"amount":27.74,"local_amount":43.6,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":46.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670723},{"amount":28.55,"local_amount":44.87,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":47.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141345},{"amount":190.5,"local_amount":299.35,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":316.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467957076}],"funded_date":"2013-09-11T06:11:39Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:22:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":602014,"name":"Farruh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farruh is married and has two children.

She lives in the Marneuli district with her husband and six children. Tsitsino\u2019s husband is a cook and is the only one who makes money in the household. The family lives below the poverty line and gets a small amount of monthly social assistance from the government. The existing income is not enough to cover the everyday costs of such a large family. \r\n\r\nTsitsino is unemployed at the moment. She has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but she hasn't had any success. She wants to start a bakery and a confectionery, but her loan request has always been rejected in the past because of her lack of experience, which is usually required by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nTsitsino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions to vulnerable poor people, who do not have access to regular credit products.

For this reason, she requested a loan of PKR 20,000 from Kashf Foundation. Saira intends to use this loan to buy more spools of thread, along with bundles of cloths in different colors.

As his income is not stable, Eldar decided to begin an additional business and seek credit among local financial institutions. His attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe Start-up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $1300. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, he will begin trading in vegetables. He will purchase stocks of groceries and transport them to different villages to resell.

She received this credit within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, the so-called \"Start-up Program\" that gives rural poor the chance to start or re-start their businesses.

She and her husband practice farming; they grow coffee and keep dairy cows on zero grazing. Seasonally, they are also employed as casuals at a tea farm to pick tea, and this supplements what they get from the farming business. With three children in school, they barely have enough to save and have electricity installed for them. \r\n\r\nTheir source of energy for lighting is kerosene, and for cooking it is firewood and charcoal. Every month, they spend at least $35 on purchasing fuel, and this is a huge sacrifice, since they have to cook and the children need light to study in the evening.  \r\n\r\nWith their four cows, Grace can be able to save this money and enjoy cleaner, better, cheaper fuel for cooking and lighting by having a bio-digester constructed for her. With a loan VEP hopes to assist Grace in getting this bio-digester. In addition to cleaner fuel, she will also be using the bio-slurry to grow fodder and food crops so that she can also save money used on buying manure from other farmers. This will increase her crop production, and we hope in the future, she can start up a business of selling green groceries.

She is married and has three children between the ages of 1 and 17 years old.  Two of the children are currently attending school and they all live at home.  She completed 7th grade before starting her business. She describes herself as a hard working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nRebecca has had a cook shop business (restaurant), which sells rice and soup for the past 10 years.

Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nHawa did not go to school and she is married.  She describes herself as a hard working woman. Her spouse works as a security man.  They have three children between 2 and 16 years old, only two of whom are in school and live at home. \r\n\r\nHawa has a table where she sells fish.  She has been in business for two years and works from Monday to Saturday, spending 10 hours per day.  With this loan, she will buy more fish.  One of the greatest challenges that she faces is to increase her sales.  She transports her goods by taxi.  She started her business with money from her husband.  She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to build a house.

She is unmarried and has five children, aged between 3 and 19.  Only four are currently attending school and they all live at home.  She was unfortunate not to attend school.  She describes herself as a hard working woman.\r\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County, which is located by the sea.  It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \r\nMarthaline has a table business which has been selling palm oil, soap, pepper, milk, sardine, etc for the past four years.  She works from 8am to 5pm every day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is making enough income. She intends to use the loan to buy more palm oil, soap, pepper, milk, sardine, etc for her business. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because it helps to support her family.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\nShe wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their help.

Her children are between the ages of 1 and 20. Only one child is currently living at home and two are in school.  \r\n\r\nMammie has had a business selling fish for the past four years. She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more fish for her business. On average, she works 10 hours a day at her business from Monday to Saturday. She started her business with a small amount of money from her fianc\u00e9e. She transports her merchandise by a shared taxi. She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is controlling her own money.

He owns banana and yucca plantations and also works as a chainsaw operator to earn extra money so he can provide for his family all year round.

She is married and has three children aged 25, 20 and 17. She is a tea farmer in rural Kyamuhunga and she gives this business a maximum of 6 hours per day. She also has a small retail shop in the same area which she concentrates on when she is not in the tea business. She started growing tea so she could be able to have a clear source of income.

Buchanan is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish. Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia. \r\n\r\nJuah finished 7th grade and is single. She describes herself as a hardworking woman. Her children's ages are between 18 and 32, one of whom is in school and lives at home. Juah has been running a table business, selling fish. She has been in this business for 20 years and works from Monday to Saturday spending 10 hours per day. With this loan, she will buy more fish to sell.  \r\n\r\nOne of the greatest challenges that she faces is low income. She transports her goods by taxi. She started her business with money from her husband.  She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to build a house.

Buchanan is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish. Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nOretha stopped her education at grade 7 before getting married. She describes herself as a hardworking woman. She has four children between the ages of 2 and 19. They are in school and live at home. \r\n\r\nOretha has been frying and selling fish, cala (balls of rice), plantain and chicken along the roadside since 2009. She works 10 hours each day at her business. With this loan, she will buy flour, fish, chicken, pepper, etc. for her business. One of the greatest challenges that she faces is the low income. She transports her goods by taxi. She started her business with money from her husband. She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to build a house. She thanks you in advance for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1421730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her children are aged 19,12, 2 and 1. The additional dependent is an orphan to whom she decided to give support in the form of supplying basic needs. \r\n\r\nNjina is in a decoration business that she has operated for the last 13 years. She started the business so she would be able to sustain herself and care for the needs of her children. She spends an average of five hours per day running the decoration business, and when she is off she works in her restaurant, which is her other source of income. \r\n\r\nHer main purpose of acquiring the UGAFODE loan is to buy materials for decoration.

She is married with 4 children. Two of her children are going to school. After her wedding, Marion established her food stand business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nMarion requires a loan in order to buy more palm oil, onions, and cooking seasonings for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and repay her loan. In the future Marion plans to own a restaurant.

He has five children and they all go to school. He also has one additional dependent who does work for him at home. His major source of income is tea growing which he started in 2007 with the motive of having a steady source of income. He gives the tea business an average of 6 hours per day, and this has helped him to harvest more quantities of tea. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the tea growing business, he also grows pineapples and bananas which are his other sources of income.

This business education is in addition to the loan they will receive.  They have a variety of business to support themselves and help educate their children.  Several make and sell food, one has a catalog business and another sells cleaning products.\n\nAna Griselda (third from the right in the photo) is a 32 year old single mother of two girls 10 years and 3 years.  The older girl, who is in school, suffers from respiratory troubles.  So Ana has expenses for medicine as well as for school.  When she became pregnant with the first daughter her parents threw her out of the house and she cleaned houses to make money to survive.  Subsequently her parents took her back and three years ago she started her food business.  In the morning, from a basket on the street, she sells bread with chicken or black beans, and other items like tortillas and stuffed peppers. She will be spending her loan money on a stove, canister of gas, a blender and a food processor plus some ingredients in bulk.  These purchases will allow her to work more efficiently in the kitchen so she can spend more time on the street selling the food she makes. Her dream is to make enough money to rent a place from which she can sell her food throughout the day.\nHer monthly sales are currently Q10,920 (US $1,400) with a profit of Q2,772 (US $355) and she hopes to increase her sales to Q13,720 (US $1,758) with an increase in profit to Q4,889 (US $627) an increase in sales of 25% and an increase in profit of 75%.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1423911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a stove, a blender and other tools she needs to cook more efficiently and spend more time selling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Mazatenango, Suchitepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-09-04T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-04T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dicxy Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Griselda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":944.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.61,"local_amount":953.68,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":959.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095149},{"amount":119.98,"local_amount":948.68,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":954.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419860868},{"amount":120.07,"local_amount":949.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":954.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509405},{"amount":123.18,"local_amount":974.01,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":979.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733257},{"amount":117.43,"local_amount":928.49,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":933.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449639178},{"amount":115.2,"local_amount":910.91,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":916.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459105532},{"amount":119.64,"local_amount":946.16,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":951.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467920408},{"amount":236.11,"local_amount":1866.95,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1877.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479141179},{"amount":2.78,"local_amount":21.76,"processed_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":21.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490835095}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T22:13:22Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:16:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":602783,"name":"Justo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El sr.

They work at the jobs that their parents taught them from a young age, which are agriculture and animal husbandry, as well as the weaving of hats recognized worldwide.  They live in the Sigsig district, a community that enjoys a lot of greenery; their fields are fertile and the hands of their people are very capable.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Elvia. She lives in the San Bartolo neighborhood of the Sigsig district. She is 41 years old, is married, and from her marriage she has 5 children, ages 21, 19, 15, 13, and 11. Her oldest daughter is already married and lives independently; her second child works and is the one who helps her financially. Her next two children study in school, and her last child is in the small local school.  Her husband works everyday as a day laborer. The house she lives in is her own.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Elvia is a very hardworking and determined woman who is looking for a better future for her children and her entire family. She works weaving Panama hats, growing crops, and raising animals. These jobs allow her to be an economically independent person at the same time she is getting ahead with her family.\r\n\r\nShe invested her previous loan in the purchase of chickens and feed for her animals, from which she earned profits.

Two years ago she finished school with a wish to study in order to improve herself, but she hasn't been able to study since she doesn't have the necessary economic resources. Her mother is a single head of household and provides for her two children with difficulty. Because of that, Mauren Nataly uses every opportunity she can get in order to study. Her mother dreams of her daughter continuing her studies, since she knows she is a good student and loves to read. She wants to see Mauren Nataly succeed and grow intellectually. If she does, her family will have a better future because Mauren Nataly will be able to work and help her mother and her younger brother who will soon finish school and dreams of continuing his studies.\r\n\r\nMauren Nataly longs to continue studying because it will open new employment opportunities. She remembers everything that she has gone through since she was little, when her mother came home without the basic necessities, Christmases when there weren't any toys or clothes, and nights when they went to bed hungry. But all this could change now with the help that Kiva can offer Mauren Nataly so that she can study and achieve her goals. She doesn't want to repeat her mother's story, but instead achieve what many others have done. She dreams of having economic stability, that is, her own house, good health for her mother, and studies for her brother.\r\n\r\nAs many others she has dreams and fears, but her desire to struggle is greater than her fears and she doesn't think about the bad things that could happen. She believes that if her faith is as strong as her wish to study everything will be possible, as long as that is what her heart and her soul desire.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1420149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to study accountancy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-09-04T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-04T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauren Nataly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.08,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":151503.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410540000},{"amount":72.69,"local_amount":135000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-27T09:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":141054.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752524},{"amount":80.77,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":156727.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845845},{"amount":70,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":135830.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696799},{"amount":48.46,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":94036.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069870}],"funded_date":"2013-09-05T05:55:42Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:00:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Isabel Valencia","image":1247399}},{"id":601284,"name":"Santiago","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El es Santiago quiere realizar su proceso acad\u00e9mico en CAMPOALTO porque es su proyecto de vida,su pasi\u00f3n es la COCINA ama el estudio y amara aun mas su profesi\u00f3n quiere realizar su sue\u00f1o de vida, quiere crecer personal y profesionalmente y siempre ha sido destacado por su buen rendimiento acad\u00e9mico su mayor anhelo es cumplir su sue\u00f1o, ser el mejor chef con reconocimientos nacionales e internacionales  y ayudar econ\u00f3micamente a su familia.

His greatest ambition is to fulfill his dream of becoming the greatest chef, earning a national and international reputation, and helping his family financially. \r\n\r\nEven when he was a small child, Santiago's family noticed his calling to service and how he relished the preparation of a simple meal. For someone so young, Santiago paid great attention to the smallest details, improved his skills, and as he grew older, developed a passion for learning more about the complex art of COOKING. Santiago's secrets, recipes, ingredients, and techniques have been his own unique way of savoring the world, with its flavors and textures. His commitment to his career grows ever stronger and he has the courage to dream of becoming the best.  \r\n\r\nSantiago considers his studies the foundation of his life and believes strongly that education is the key to a better world. His ideal is to contribute to society, influence everyone he meets, and share his knowledge. Santiago hopes that his example will motivate others so that everyone who dreams will never give up and will pursue their dreams, no matter the cost. As a child, Santiago always thought that he'd never give up his culinary dreams. When he looks back, Santiago feels proud that he's pursued those dreams and ambitions even when few people believed he could fulfill them. Santiago believes that he only needs desire and passion, and to never give up in the face of challenges. He will be grateful to anyone who supports him just as he hopes to support others, regardless of social class. \r\n\r\nSantiago believes strongly that we're all equal and were born with talents and abilities that allow us to both to learn and to teach.

","en":"The association \"And Siggil Hann\" comprises several women who are residents from the suburbs of Dakar. At first, the women associated with each another at weekly tontine meetings enabling them to finance themselves in support of their revenue-generating businesses. Today, the association has just signed a partnership with the microfinance institution U-IMCEC in order to bolster the women's economic power, so as to help manage their businesses better and to fight poverty. \r\n\r\nThus, the association \"And Siggil Hann 5\" is a loan group of ten women who live in the same district and who work in the same business sector. The women are represented by Ms. Anta, a married woman who has been selling natural fruit drinks for twenty years. She starts each workday at 8 AM and works until 1 PM. The profits she earns from her business enable her to cover her home's electricity costs. \r\n\r\nAnta is a member of a U-IMCEC branch, where she is requesting a loan to purchase 'monkey bread' (the fruit of the baobab tree) and some 'bissap' (dried hibiscus flowers), which are the ingredients for making the juice drinks she sells.\r\n\r\nWith the growth in her profits, she plans on diversifying the products she sells by starting sales of 'fataya' [a kind of empanada served with sauce] and coffee. She would also like to save money for realizing her wish to travel to large countries for business purposes, so as to import merchandise to resell.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1420992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase local products to making juice drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2013-09-04T16:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-04T16:00:01Z","loan_amount":4175,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Dior","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seynabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seynabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oulimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madjigu\u00e8ne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":2050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170833.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":347.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":347.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":347.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":347.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":347.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":602245,"name":"Charity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charity is married, with three children.

She has a lot of experience in this field of work, but she hasn't done any sewing work for several years. Her children were small, and she didn't have any time to sit down and do any sewing or embroidery. Now Makhbuba is ready to resume her favorite activity and make dresses for sale, as well as create new  types of dresses. To do this she needs a new, upgraded sewing machine that is quick and easy to set up and operate. With this goal in mind, she has requested a loan in the amount of 1500 US dollars. She awaits your kind assistance.\r\n\r\nMakhbuba has to work a lot to provide for her children. Currently she takes care of livestock on her home property.
