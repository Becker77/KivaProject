His parents taught him to perform these activities, as he is from a rather large family with 14 members and scarce financial resources. For this same reason, they were not able to give everyone the opportunity to study. At the age of twenty, he got together with his life partner; they began to work on their own and had four children together. Two of his children are already in relationships and have left home, while the other two are studying for their high school degrees.\r\n\r\nTogether with his parents and siblings, he cultivated 14,000 square meters of corn and also worked with cotton, cultivating his own and working as a day laborer. He currently works on 14,000 square meters of corn and also makes trips in a cart when he is requested and as a day laborer. He is helped by his two older children, who work on different areas of the land, as the two younger ones are studying.\r\n\r\nThe funds from the loan will be utilized to buy agricultural supplies like manure and fertilizers, to pay workers and to prepare the land to plant 14,000 square meters of corn. He hopes to improve his cultivation of corn and to be able to have a better production at the end of the harvest.

Her husband makes iron chains by hand in his workshop. The chain is made on a hearth by hammering cut lengths of red hot wrought iron rods into oval links, one link passing through the next to form a cable. Now, the price of iron has increased and he does not have any in stock to make more chains so he is unable to make any chains to sell and earn an income.\n\nNagina requested a loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband can buy new iron rod coils and start his business again. Nagina is the mother of six children and it is very difficult to feed all of them in a day. Her dreams are to provide all the necessities to each of her children.

Initially, they met through a weekly tontine [savings group] that allowed them to self-finance their income-generating activities. Currently the group has signed a partnership with UIMCEC to support the economic empowerment of women so that they better manage their businesses and fight against poverty. \n\nSiggil Hann 1 is a borrowing group of 12 women who live in the same neighborhood. They are represented by Mrs. Wolimata, a married woman with 10 years of commercial experience selling fabrics and juices.

cities in Nimba County and the second-largest populated county in Liberia; it is rich in natural resources. He\u2019s married with three children, ages 3, 8, and 21; all live at home and attend school. For the past 10 years, he has been running a gas station. Robert L. has requested this loan to purchase more gasoline in order to have his business turn into a bigger one. \n\nThe problem he faces is the road's condition to his gas station, because some of his customers complain of bad roads leading to his station that cause them not to buy every day from him. He started this business by selling for his father on a table market, and learned this was of business from his friends.

They both have five children between 13 to 23. Only four are in school and live at home. \n\nWith little money from her mother, she was able to establish her business. Since 2006 she has been running a small local shop where she sells rice, salt, bitter-ball, okra, oil, etc; she spends nine hours each day on her business, from Monday to Saturday. \n\nOne problem she faces is small income. She is requesting a loan to purchase more rice, salt, bitter-ball, okra, oil, etc for her business. \n\nHer plan is to one day build a modern house.

He is married, has two children, and lives in a small village.  He loves his children and tries to make sure that they are never in need of anything.  He has been making a living from his business for a long time.  Kholmat is a very hard-working person.  His business consists of buying cattle, raising it and selling the collected milk and meat.  He has a lot of experience in this field and, with the help from his wife, his business provides him with a stable income.

In particular, he has a plot of agricultural land, where he grows potatoes and haricot.  He works hard and always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. Jambul also has a milk cow. His wife milks the cow every day and produces dairy products for selling. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Jambuli decided to start his own business.  He is seeking credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts have been unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe Start-up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables poor rural and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting a business. Jambuli's application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1,600 GEL. \r\n\r\nWith the credit, Jambul will purchase a stock of groceries and different kinds of vegetables and transport them in his car to different villages for resale. This will increase the income of his family. With increased income, he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family.

In addition, they have two milking cows and produce dairy products to sell. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Murad decided to start his own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts was unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The start-up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Murad\u2019s application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1,600 GEL. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Murad will purchase a stock of nuts to resell at a higher price.

","en":"This is Firdavs' second loan.  He took a previous loan to buy dried fruits and was involved in that activity for almost seven years.  He has now saved some money and is ready to make his old dream come true: he has been thinking about opening an internet cafe for a long time, and he feels that now is the right time.  To prepare himself for this and to familiarize himself with all the nuances of this business, he has spent the last year working in an internet cafe.\r\n\r\nFirdavs has already rented a space, located in a nice popular area, and he has bought a couple of computers and their components.  In order to be fully ready to open his internet cafe, he still needs to buy a few more computers.  With this goal in mind, he has applied for a loan as a way to finance his business.

He went to school until he finished his high school degree, since he did not continue with his higher level education for economic reasons, seeing the need to look for work and for that reason to set his studies aside. He is single, but he has a little daughter. With evidence that Se\u00f1or Marcelo has a great deal of experience in construction work, since he has been in this work for more than four years, today he is applying for the present loan to be able to remodel the house where he now lives. He indicates that the loan granted to him will help him improve the conditions in which he lives, indicating that it is during these days of cold that he is most affected."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1423807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

six children.  He lives in the countryside where the main source of income comes from farming and raising livestock.  Rustam is 46 years old and married to a wonderful woman.  For more than 15 years, he has made a living from farming.  He raises crops such as rice, wheat and corn, which he sells at the market.  Since his harvest is of the highest quality, there is always great demand for it.  His wife and his son help him with this business. In order to provide his family with all of the necessities, he wishes to expand his enterprise.

She is the mother of one daughter and lives in a common-law marriage with her partner. Five years ago, she started her own business producing arepas [corn cakes]. This idea arose because of the difficult economic situation her family was experiencing some years ago. She learned this work in a practical way, and little by little she perfected her technique and her knowledge for running the business. She has her daughter's help with the business, and she starts working very early in the morning, when she begins the day's production. Later she goes out to sell the arepas to various stores and to neighbors in the area where she lives. In this way, she has been able to generate sufficient income to cover her household expenses and provide an education for her daughter. Alba is a strong, dedicated woman who is passionate about her work and her family. This is the motive for requesting her fourth loan cycle, with the aim of carrying out some improvements to the business (replacing the floor and painting the walls). This will permit her to improve the image of the business and generate greater confidence among her customers about the way she prepares her products.

","en":"Abror is a young and active 23-year old young man. He is married and has one child, a daughter who was born recently. After finishing school, Abror was not able to obtain a higher education because of financial problems in the family. He began to develop independently in the technology field. Arbor and his friends  learned from the masters who repair mobile phones and other equipment. Thus, he learned a lot and gained experience in this business. Now, Abror has his own business. This way, he makes a living and supports the well-being of his family. Abror is an entrepreneur who repairs mobile phones. He has a mobile phone repair storefront in the center of town. His wife is a homemaker and is not employed.  She is raising their child and does work around the house. Since his business requires constant innovation, Abror wants to buy new equipment for further use.  This equipment will allow him to diversify and improve the quality of his services. Therefore, Abror has turned to Arvand and would like to receive a loan for the purchase of new equipment.

Ashkali community. His mother died many years ago. They own a small old house that is in need of renovation and has not had any repairs in the last several years. One of the main problems is the insufficient insulation, with the house losing much heat in the winter time. G\u00ebzim is the main source of income for his family but he makes very little income working in a market and on the street selling mobile phones.  \r\n\r\nEvery winter, it costs a lot of money to buy coal to keep the house warm.

She has five cows from which she gets milk, which she sells to her neighbors. Being familiar with the delicious milk that her animals produce, they buy it from her every day. She also raises sheep and hens for her own use, but keeps in mind that if she has to deal with some eventuality, she will fatten them and sell them at the market.\r\n\r\n\"I have large fields which I use to plant alfalfa and oats that I use to feed my animals.

He sells their milk door to door and in the main market. By doing so he generates income to fulfill his family's needs. His net income is not enough to cope with the daily and monthly needs of his family. He has lots and lots of expenses to pay for.

So he is planning to purchase one more buffalo so that he will have more milk to sell. \r\n\r\nHowever due to financial constraints, he finds it difficult.

He has 10 children and has been doing this work for 6 years. His primary income sources are milk, crops, transportation services, and personal business.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Dairy farming.' His biggest challenge is 'climate changes affecting crops.' An animal on the farm has been given the name 'Mitchel.'\r\n\r\nJohn was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'he was interested in dairy farming.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'The funds given if used properly make payment easier.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees.

Mahmadnazar and his wife, Davlatbi, went through a lot.  And their next plans are also not easy to accomplish.  Mahmadnazar decided to open his own shop to repair cars.  Because he spent several years working at an auto service, he obtained sufficient experience and now want to open his own business in this field.  The only barrier to realizing his plans is the lack of money.  Mahmadnazar used his savings to build a 12x6 meter space near his house with burnt brick to open the shop.  Now he has 400 dollars remaining.  This is why he is requesting a loan in the amount of 1500 US dollars to buy spare parts for cars and finally start his own auto repair business."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1420768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy spare parts for cars and start his own auto repair business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kulob","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.909167 69.781944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-09-05T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-05T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahmadnazar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":602508,"name":"Vichheka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vichheka (in the photo), 20 years old, is single.

She lives with her two children, Wilfredo and Yamileth, in the house she bought 10 years ago. For the last 20 years she has worked selling meat. She says that her job consists of buying pigs, particularly those which are heavy and healthy, which she then slaughters to sell the meat at local fairs. This brings in a good income, and she uses her good standing with customers to also sell beauty products. Things are going well for her, and she says that she sells more meat at festivals. A little while ago, she found a place to open her own chicharroneria (restaurant selling pork dishes), which will allow her to earn more money as she will be sourcing and preparing the meat herself. Business has been good, as the restaurant is located in a commercial district. This is her sixth loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support she is receiving to be able to get ahead.

Animals on the farm have been given the names Ruto, and Ngilu.\r\n\r\nRafael was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Because they offer farming loans.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'That recordkeeping is very important for a group to survive.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Rafael replied 'They will have milk for consumption and sale to substitute his income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Rafael owns the following: a cow, poultry, and a bicycle but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net and TV but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, or a

He is professional in his techniques and can easily fix the problem of engines in no time. He has to use various types of tools for the maintenance of buses. A few days ago, he shifted his workshop to another place.  During shifting, some important and expensive tools such as Philips screw driver, flat blade screw drivers, a drill machine, pliers, socket & ratchet set, heat gun, try square, G clamp, hammer, etc., were lost.  Rubeena requested a loan for her husband so that her husband would be able to compensate against this loss. \r\n\r\nRubeena wants to provide a better education and living standard to her children. She is hopeful that her husband will utilize this amount in a positive way and his monthly income will increase.

Buchanan is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea.  It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\n \nShe did not go to school and she is married.  She describes herself as a hard-working woman. Her spouse works as a security man.  They have four children between 14 and 23 years old, only three of whom are in school and live at home. \n\nSoyjah has a table business where she sells dry bush meat.  She has been in business for five years and works from Monday to Saturday, spending 10 hours per day.  With this loan, she will buy more dry bush meat.  One of the greatest challenges that she faces is limited income.  She transports her goods by shared taxi.  She started her business with money from her husband.  She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. Her future plan is to build a house.  She thanks you in advance for your support!\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1421682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

men of Shamata to be entrepreneurs. They had an agenda of helping each other start up small businesses so that by the time they marry they would be financially stable. Over that time they have been groomed to be disciplined and plan their lives while avoiding the reckless lifestyle lived by most young men.\nSince Shamata is not connected to the electricity grid, the group saw an opportunity during one of VEPs promotional drives and decided to partner with VEP and establish themselves as a solar lamp supplier in that region. They plan to stock solar lamps that are accredited by Lighting Africa as quality, and  which are also supplied by VEP and hence have a sustainable business.\nVEP has loaned them start-up capital and is also helping them in promotion and marketing.\nIt\u2019s expected that the business will pick up in no time as the community is already appreciating the benefits of using solar energy instead of kerosene. Peter, the Chairman of the group (the first person standing on the left side) explains that so far the group members are the first beneficiaries of the lamps and they no longer buy kerosene.\nHis wife who has suffered using dim light for 2 years is now very happy and is also encouraging other women to buy the lamps. Peter and his family can now enjoy improved health with cleaner lighting and they also save the money that was previously used on buying kerosene. He has opened up an account and started saving the earnings from the sale of the solar lights which he says will be a financial security for his family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":1421681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy

forties with three children. Her family relies on rice cropping on five hectares as the primary source of income. She has been involved with this business for 21 years, earning about 28,700 KHR per day. \n\nThis is the second microloan for Sarom\u2019s group with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

","en":"Lolajon is a 63-year-old widow with four children. Not long ago she lost her husband, with whom she had lived side by side for almost 40 years. It was difficult for her, but she came to terms with it, as she has children and grandchildren she needs to live for, as well as work that she has to continue.\r\n\r\nFor 20 years, Lolajon has been working as Delegate of the Isoyev division of the J. Rumy region. The residents of her village respect her for her honesty and fairness. All of her children are adults now and support themselves.
