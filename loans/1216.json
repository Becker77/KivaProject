Being an adult now, Cindy plans to find a job which will allow her to help her mother and her little sisters. She is preparing herself to do this successfully, Cindy can contribute, paying for her own studies and helping with some of the household expenses. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago, she took part in a program which offered technical training to compete in the labor market. She signed up and passed; thanks to this program she was able to broaden her knowledge in all areas having to do with a career such as public accounting. One year ago, she entered the institution to broaden her knowledge, and she has felt very satisfied there, since it provides a very good quality of learning and accommodates her as a person. Now that she has the opportunity to do something for her well-being, she is not about to abandon it, and in this way she can provide help to her mom. \r\n\r\nCindy enjoys sports and likes to exercise, read and help out in the house. She also likes to participate in theater productions or to be involved in anything having to do with culture or the arts in general. She would like to be part of an academy and study theater arts in the future, so that she can become a great actress as well as a professional accountant and be recognized as an enterprising woman. She also has a great desire to help the most needy in the country and be able to contribute to foundations, not only by herself but working with many people who want to improve the country's future.

Her mother separated from her irresponsible father five years after [Yuri] was born because he provided a bad life.  He did not meet with his responsibilities and mistreated them.  Her mother decided to give herself a new opportunity with another man who seemed like he loved them, but after six long years, life became unbearable with this man because of his bad intentions with Yuri, so she decided to run away at age 13 and create a new life with her grandmother\u2019s help.\r\n\r\nIn a small town age doesn\u2019t matter, only the desire to work.  She saw the need to quit school and work.  She did this for a year while she recovered from all the damage that the man had done to her regarding clothing, school books, and shoes.  After that she decided to go back to school and finish the final two grades, (10 and 11).  She bought school supplies, uniforms, and paid tuition with the money she earned and made a deal with her boss so she could work until 6:00 pm so she could attend school at 6:30 pm.  This allowed her to finish high school.\r\n\r\nAfter this she went to the capital and a friend gave her the opportunity to work in a small accessories shop where she met her husband.  Her greatest desire is to be able to finish studying for the career that she is studying for, so that her family will have a better quality of life.  She is grateful to her husband because he has always backed her and he has not interfered with her desire to get ahead.  She feels that education is the best investment that can be made, so she makes an effort to get one.  She is also an example to her five year old daughter.  She knows that Kiva is the best option she has and she is asking for your help.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1423196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-09-05T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-05T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":780000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.08,"local_amount":117600,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":124469.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539988},{"amount":219.26,"local_amount":402400,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":425904.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696784},{"amount":76.28,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":148177.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392988},{"amount":65.38,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127009.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069872}],"funded_date":"2013-09-06T13:11:15Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:00:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

the Ninotsminda district. The source of income for the family is the monthly salaries of Arshaluis\u2019s parents. His father is an electrician and his mother works as a cleaner to earn a living. Arshaluis is a very energetic young man and wishes to be financially independent and provide the family with better living conditions. That\u2019s why he decided to apply for the credit and start a taxi business.\r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved under the framework of the Startup program, which is the joint project of MFO Credo and Kiva.

Thus he works as a day laborer on various farms in the region, and in addition, he has fields with different products, whose harvests are collected to be sold in the various markets of the region. This borrower is a vigorous, active, and hard-working man, dedicated to his family, who are his principal motivation to continue advancing and overcome all the adversities that are presented to him, whether with his crops or at a personal level. Nevertheless, he always finds the tools to continue advancing. Now he is applying for a loan, which will be invested in the purchase of agricultural supplies (compost, pesticides, and fertilizers, among other items), with the goal of giving continuity to his work, caring for and preparing his crops so that the next harvests will be more productive and will allow him to increase the profit margin that he receives from the sale of his foods. In this way, Marcelo dreams of maintaining his crops, expanding them, and making them sustainable, so that they allow him to enjoy a stable economy and a greater well-being at the side of the people he loves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1421328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies (compost, pesticides, and fertilizers, among other items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Ceret\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-05T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-05T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelo De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35698},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36686},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37702},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38745},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39818},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40920},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42052},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43216},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44413},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45642},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46905},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48203}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.54,"local_amount":128248,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":136817.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807465},{"amount":21.4,"local_amount":38906,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":41505.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095549},{"amount":22.01,"local_amount":40022,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42696.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074606},{"amount":22.64,"local_amount":41169,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":43919.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009800},{"amount":72.46,"local_amount":131752,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":140555.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227133},{"amount":65.95,"local_amount":119903,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":127915.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480244827}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T07:04:52Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:56:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":602237,"name":"Virgen Poderosa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Virgen Poderosa  est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 5\u00ba  del programa de comit\u00e9, donde todas trabajan  y se ayudan por salir adelante se dedican a sus respectivas actividades.

She will use the rest of the loan to prepare the land and sow new seeds.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1424522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies to tend her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-05T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-05T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":152.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070313},{"amount":1.29,"local_amount":25.78,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":26.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833748},{"amount":164,"local_amount":3280.1,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3344.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449616521},{"amount":3.04,"local_amount":60.74,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":61.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490813022},{"amount":824.17,"local_amount":16483.38,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":16804.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504237143}],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T19:51:24Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:06:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Philip Hess","image":1178611}},{"id":602659,"name":"Armine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Armine is a 36-year-old married woman who lives in Vanadzor city with her two school-aged children.

She is married to Julio and has 4 children, and she lives with them in her own house. At first, she worked in agriculture, on some plots of land she owns outside the city, until she was able to save up enough money. Then, with the aim of remaining close to her children, she set up a grocery store in the first floor of her home. Each morning, she gets up very early and serves her customers, whom she treats with great warmth, since they are the heart of her business, and she offers them a broad variety of products, such as grains, vegetables and packaged foods such as milk, canned goods, and other items. \r\n\r\nShe likes to keep her business well-stocked at all times, since that is the key to retaining her customers. She has 12 years of experience with her store, and this has also allowed her to make good friendships and become very well-known in the neighborhood.

This area has a cold climate, with very fertile land and has several areas of natural beauty. Its architecture is a mix of colonial and modern. Its people, like the team members, maintain their culture and traditions. Their main source of income is from agriculture, animal husbandry, and many leave the city daily in order to work in different activities that will help improve their economic stability at home. All have a common goal, which is to improve their family lives. \r\n\r\nOne of the female members of this group is Digna, who is applying for her third loan for the Gullanpugro loan group. She likes this way of getting loans because of the unity and camaraderie that exists between all of the members. At the same time these loans help her to better their business. \r\n\r\nDigna is 31 years old, married and has had four children who are now aged 12, 9, 7 and 2.

He is married with two children age 12 and 17 years. In 2008, Mohamed established his clothing business. He began his business because after he completed his sixth form his family could not afford to pay his college fees, so he raised money to start up his business. Before this he was a cleaner. He works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. He says that the main challenge to his business is the lack of enough capital to run his business.\r\n\r\nMohamed requires a loan in order to buy men's shirts, shoes, jeans, and ladies' jeans to expand his business. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to increase his business and repay his loan. In the future Mohamed plans to build his own business structure and open another outlet.

She is very grateful to her husband for trying to make their life better. \r\n\r\nNelufar has a dream of living in a well-built home where she can raise her wonderful daughter in good conditions. The house they live in now needs major repairs since it was built a long time ago and has many problems. But Nelufar's wages won't cover the costs, so she has to put aside money for the renovations from her husband's earnings. Some time ago, Nelufar began fixing up her house. But she soon had to stop working due to lack of funds. She now would like to continue the repairs and finally finish them. For this reason she has decided to ask for a loan. Nelufar has turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase building materials for renovations to her house. She thanks Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n    "}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1416975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to buy building materials to fix up her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She and her partner have five children, who are in different grades in secondary school. She completed her primary education, thanks to a lot of effort and sacrifice on the part of her parents, who also taught her how to farm. On the farm it is only the family that works, with no external help. The family heads to the countryside every day, along with the children once they have finished their school day. That is where they do the work necessary to maintain their protected crops. Their crops are one kilometre away from their home. \r\n\r\nNorma's harvest is sold in the local market on a small scale, and to certain buyers who come from different regions near to the place where she lives. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of seeing her children grow up to be professionals and good people, getting by in the world in the best way possible. With time, by way of the land that they are currently working, Norma hopes to create employment opportunities for other people. It is for this reason that she is currently asking for a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative, in order to buy five quintals of fertilizers, five quintals of urea, five quintals of coffee fertilizer and five litres of coffee nutrients.

She is an old member of BRAC and she is taking another loan after her two previous loans. Two years ago, she took a loan and purchased an auto rickshaw for her husband with contributions from her savings. Due to continuously driving and due to bad condition of roads the rickshaw body got gradually depreciated. During driving it creates a rattled noisy voice, which is ridiculous for the passengers. His daily income is spent on household expenses and he does not have savings to fix the problem.\n\nTherefore, Sadiqa contacted with the Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan and let us know about her financially condition. She is in her third loan cycle and has shown an excellent repayment behavior. Due to her excellent repayment schedule the field officer approved a loan for her. \nWith this amount her husband would be able to repair rickshaw body and able to drive it again.\nSadiqa seems very happy after taking this loan and says thanks to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1416204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded

All of the children live with Do\u00f1a Ludis. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Ludis is a farmer who grows coffee, as well as corn and beans, although those two crops are only for the family's consumption. Do\u00f1a Ludis' parents taught her to farm when she was very young, sharing with her a lifetime of experience. The family owns its the land it farms, having acquired it through years of hard work and dedication. After the harvest, Do\u00f1a Ludis sells her crops to wholesalers who travel through the region purchasing high-quality produce at reasonable prices. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Ludis' long-term goal  is to earn first a high school diploma and then a university degree. Higher education will make her children proud of her; they'll see that she's a role model for them and that they can also achieve professional careers for themselves.  \r\n\r\nThese aspirations are the motivations for Do\u00f1a Ludis and her partner to strive diligently each day. Their goals are also the reason she is applying for a loan that she'll use to purchase eight quintales of urea, and eight quintales each of 12-24-12 and 18-26-0 fertilizers to cultivate and sustain her coffee crop.

He is married to Digna, his business partner, and they have children. He and his wife manage their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses.  \n\nJoseph operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. \n\nHe also has a variety store for additional income. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\n\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan.

y que se encuentran desesperados por una mano que les alivie, porque ayudar a las personas me da una satisfacci\u00f3n inmensa y pues pienso que a cada persona Dios le env\u00eda a la tierra con una

This is her story: Hello my name is Massiel. I am 24 years old. I currently live in Altos de Rafey with a family member, since I am not from this city. Sometimes I find myself forced to move constantly because I am not from Santiago and I do not have immediate family members here. I was born and raised in the town of Altamira, Puerto Plata. I grew up there with my parents and went to primary school in a small little school, which was a little far away from me and I had to walk, but I went very happily because I have always liked to study.\n\nMy father is a farmer. He loves to work the land. This is his passion and our means of support, while my mother takes care of the home and the family.\n\nI am pursuing my studies in medicine at the Santiago University of Technology (UTESA). \n\nWhen I was young, I liked to take care of the animals, and when it rained, I would go take care of them and cover them from the rain and there one day lying in my bed I asked myself how I could help others and I remembered those white lab coats I saw when I went to the rural hospital. Those people who were at the service of the people, helping, and in that bed I said to myself I am going to be a doctor.\n\nI like the career of medicine for the following reasons:\n\nBecause I love the study of life and the way I can help people to prevent, to maintain and restore their health, because I want to help people who suffer, who are in pain and who find themselves desperate for a helping hand, because helping people gives me immense satisfaction and I think that God sends each person to earth with a mission and gives a skill and a virtue to each one and I have found mine.\n\nDay by day I want to improve it because I feel that with my effort, my devotion, and my dedication I can do a lot and that God will use me as an instrument to reach those who are fighting to live and to combat a disease and that they have a future ahead of them.\n\nI need the help of this loan because I come from a family with few resources, so it is difficult for them to pay for my studies, and with this loan I would do better, because I would be able to take a greater number of subjects and there would not be any limitations. Without receiving this loan, I would continue fighting for my dream; I know that it would take me more time, but I refuse to give up. This loan would affect my life in a positive way, because it would bring me to the place I want to be, my goal, my dream, and I would do it in a faster, continuous, and secure way.\n\nMy academic goals are: to do well academically, to learn for my life and my profession and not for the moment. Once I finish at the University my vision is to be a specialist and a brilliant physician who does her work well and cares about her patients.\n\nRegarding my family and personal life:\n\nI want to help my family so that they can enjoy the best quality of life. I believe in family and love, so I would like to have my own family and be an example to follow in it, to let the town know that someone ordinary like me can with courage and passion achieve what nobody was able to imagine \u2013 that I would be a doctor.\n\nWhen I finish my studies:\n\nI want to specialize in general surgery, have my office to work in, pay my debts, improve my quality of life and help all the people who need me. I want to do medical clinics so that people with few resources can come in and have office visits and medicines.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1421065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is the mother of eight children. Seven of them are adults and live in their own homes. Only one, a 21 year old, lives at home with them. He decided to stop school in the second year of university and  help his father with the work in the fields. As a family they plant and grow coffee and other basic grains on a small scale, which serves to sustain the family and occasionally they sell part of their product. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has worked in this field for more than 40 years now. It is a tradition that goes back generations in her family. She sells the coffee beans \"en oro\" (separated from the outer skin or fruit and polished) through intermediaries so they avoid paying the shipping cost to the warehouse. It is stored and sold there. Her fields are about five minutes away by car and another part 15 minutes away. Her goal is for her children to receive a better inheritance, leaving a solid house and land they can work. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's dream is for her youngest son to finish university. She considers that the assistance she is requesting from COMIXMUL will help her achieve this project. What she needs right now is to help her coffee crops buying 8 quintals of urea, 8 quintals of Formula 12-24-12 and 8 quintals of Formula 18-26-0.

Percy feels that his business is moving forward because he is very responsible and, above all, because he wants to get ahead in life. \r\n\r\nPercy is very grateful to Kiva's small lenders as thanks to the help they have provided, he will be able to purchase more gems and thus have a greater variety of products to offer. He will continue to fight to realize his greatest dream: to provide his children with a profession."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1424604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase merchandise (gems)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Carhuaz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-09-06T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-06T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Percy Washintong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":151.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":156.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":162.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":169.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":176.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":183.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.99,"local_amount":151.98,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":160.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054772},{"amount":58.79,"local_amount":156.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":165.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819667},{"amount":60.81,"local_amount":162.15,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":170.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472586},{"amount":63.62,"local_amount":169.66,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":178.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695060},{"amount":66.01,"local_amount":176.02,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":185.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450391083},{"amount":68.78,"local_amount":183.42,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":193.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067562}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T21:10:40Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristen McNeill","image":null}},{"id":603598,"name":"Ivette Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ivette es originaria de la ciudad de Granada.

She is a 49-year-old from Waterloo, an eastern area in Sierra Leone. She is married with four children. Two of her children are currently attending school. For the past 20 years, Fatmata has established a palm oil business in a particular market area. She began her business because she wanted to create a permanent source of income to support her children. She works at the business from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm, seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the high cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase more local food like gallons of palm oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to become more successful and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Fatmata plans to export her palm oil to a neighboring country.

He plans to install balconies and windows, as well as change the metal panels on his roof so that water doesn't leak into the house during rainy season, and finish building a bedroom. Heriberto Antonio is very excited about these modifications because he knows that it will make his family safer and more comfortable. However, he does't presently have enough capital to purchase everything he needs to carry out the home improvements. For this reason, he decided to request a loan from FUSAI in order to buy windows, window guards, sheet metal, bricks, cement, and other supplies. \r\n\r\nHeriberto Antonio is very happy with this help and he assures lenders that he and his wife will do everything possible to get out of debt in the established time period.

She is a 41-year-old from Waterloo, eastern area in Sierra Leone. She is married with three children between the ages of 12 years and 19 years. Two of her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Kadiatu established her local food business within the Waterloo community. She began her business because she did not go to school and was forced into early marriage, so she decided to empower herself with business. She works at the business from 8:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the price inflation of goods.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to purchase more local food like ground nuts, gari [cassava flakes] and beans.

Apiza has higher education. She does animal husbandry as a main source of income for her family which she started 24 years ago with the purchase of cattle for an amount of 8,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work Apiza now has four milk cows, thirty sheep and also a plot of land in the size of 1.5 hectares where he annually grows corn, sunflower and potatoes.

Filder sells shoes at the Sunday market in his district where other merchants sell clothing.  Many customers, including farmers, visit the city to make their weekly purchases.  Filder started his business eight years ago, encouraged by his wife, in order to take care of the family.  He used the money he had saved from working in different jobs to buy his first batch of shoes which he sold as a street vendor.  Later on he decided to sell his goods at the Sunday fair in his district which is organized by the local authorities.  He was able to consolidate his business which has helped his economy.\r\n\r\nAt his stall we can find different kinds of men's and women's shoes and slippers as well as baby and school children's shoes.  He is very happy with his work because he earns a good income.  Over time he wants to expand his business and become a wholesale supplier.\r\n\r\nThis is his second Kiva loan and he is grateful for the financial support and committed to paying back the loan on time.

Her husband drives a mini loader vehicle; he provides loading and unloading services to a firm. \r\n\r\nZahra's husband carries metal from one place to another but due to maximum load, the body and engine of his mini loader have depreciated. Now his mini loader needs maintenance, otherwise his monthly income would be highly affected because he does not have another source of income. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Zahra requested a loan for the maintenance of their mini loader so that her husband can smoothly earn income to run their household and to support his family. She is very hopeful Kiva lenders will support her for fund raising. \r\n\r\nZahra is very thankful to Kiva and to its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Zyinat's monthly income is 6,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her homestead, Zyinat turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep to expand the count of livestock on her homestead. \r\n\r\nZyinat plans to invest income from the loan to further augment the quantity of domestic animals and plans to save money for home repairs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1421409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kommunizm village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-06T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-06T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zyinat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4648},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4784},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4923},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5067},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5214},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5364}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.83,"local_amount":4648,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4716.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014130},{"amount":99.67,"local_amount":4784,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4854.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777195},{"amount":102.56,"local_amount":4923,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4995.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427035},{"amount":105.57,"local_amount":5067,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5142.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942594},{"amount":220.37,"local_amount":10578,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10734.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553086}],"funded_date":"2013-09-09T23:12:05Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":602853,"name":"Neab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neab is a 29-year-old woman living in Pursat province.

27, is a single man who lives  in Ibb, Yemen. He is a hardworking man who likes to depend on himself.  He didn`t complete his studies due to the bad situation he faced. Over time, he has managed to collect a small amount to buy a mini-bus to earn daily expenses. \r\n\r\nRecently, his bus is not working well so he needs to repair his bus to continue providing for his family. He applied for a youth loan of 100,000 YER from AMB to buy spare parts to repair his bus so as to increase his daily income. He hopes to improve his living standards and own an extra bus.

Her younger son learned how to operate the lathe machine from a professional person for many years. Now he can operate the lathe machine and carry on his father\u2019s business. However, the lathe machine is in need of repair. Therefore, Safia requested a loan for her son so that he could have the lathe machine fixed. \r\nSafia is relieved now because she hopes that her son will be an expert soon and get a reasonable income

She has been handicapped since birth. She uses a wheelchair because her legs prevent her from walking alone, and she uses her hands to move herself around the house. However, she has overcome her disability with the great spirit of solidarity she shares with her family and neighbors. She reads and writes, is currently a member of her local ADESCO, and is the treasurer of Fundaci\u00f3n Campo's loan committee.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has a small shop in her house and also manages the school store, where she sells sweets and fruits to the students from 6:30 a.m. until noon. Her mother prepares the merchandise each day, and her nieces take her in her wheelchair to the school, which is about 50 meters from her house. Here she sits on a bench surrounded by the merchandise she sells to her customers. She learned the business from her mother, who has always managed small grocery shops and is involved in this business. Elizabeth is the owner of the business and has always been excellent at keeping accounts, managing inventory, and memorizing the telephone numbers of almost all her neighbors. Her mother, sister, nephews, and nieces are partners in the business and help her attend to the customers. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to pay the balance of a loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Campo; to buy merchandise for the store in her house and in the school; to buy fertilizer for her potato crop; and to plant her 0.7 hectare corn plot. She will have inventory to grow her shops, and she will be able to increase her and her family's income.        \r\n\r\nShe would like to expand her stores by adding more merchandise because she is well known in the neighborhood, the children like her, and she is growing her customer base. Now she gets by with little merchandise and has nothing to sell during the second school recess. She expects profits to cover her loan payments and part of the household expenses.

Her two sons are very expert in manufacturing furniture and help their father. Her husband has been making furniture for many years, and with the help of his two sons, his business is established very well. Their practice is to make furniture and then polish the furniture for finishing. Polish increases the shine, grace and value of the furniture.\r\n\r\nThe demand for manufacturing suddenly increased, and her husband has spent all the money to buy raw material instead of furniture polish. Now he does not have enough to buy his remaining raw material. Therefore, Gulshan requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband would be able to buy the remaining inventory.\r\n\r\nGulshan is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan, for this honorable support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1423486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy polish for furniture finishing.

old, married, and lives in the city of Vahdat.  She is a homemaker.  She has four children.  It is always nice when a person is doing what they enjoy.  It is doubly so if one is able to convert their favorite activity or a hobby into a profitable business.  With this in mind, Malohat wishes to start her own sewing business from home.  She knows how to sew and tailor traditional dresses for women.  In order to start this business, she needs to obtain a sewing machine.  This is why she decided to ask for a loan.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to use this loan to buy a new automated sewing machine and some fabric.  Malohat expects, in a day, to sew one simple dress and one dress with embroidery.  At the same time, she will also take care of the household.

Today she is proud to be famous in her community as the best at making beautiful designs. Now she has requested a loan of 20,000 PKR to purchase more material such as spools of thread with packs of beads and glittering material in different colors. She says that the females in her community are becoming demanding with the passage of time and satisfying them is a challenge that she has taken up.

He lives with them.\r\n\r\nShe learned this when she was very young, since her family has been doing this for generations and now she does this with her husband.  She sells her harvests to intermediaries who visit her community.  Her crops are located about two km from her home, although a small portion of them are in the same community.  The whole family pitches in, so they are able to avoid the cost of hiring a lot of people.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy 4QQ of urea, 4 QQ of formula 12-24-12, and 18-46-0 for her coffee crops.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to build an avian farm so that the people from the nearby surrounding areas will buy from her.

tailoring in her community. She has been doing it for the past five years. She knows the techniques of stitching very well. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns enough to lead a decent life.

A father of four children, he lives in a traditional family in the Massablacoura neighborhood in the town of Bougouni (in the third administrative region in the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nIdrissa has been selling cereals for fifteen years. His experience has earned him a good reputation and he receives orders for cereals, especially corn and sorghum. Three months ago, he also started selling groundnut oil. \r\n\r\nIn order to have the stock he needs to satisfy his customers, he is working with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He is on his tenth loan now, and his nine previous loans have all been repaid correctly. This new loan will allow him to buy four tons of corn, one ton of sorghum, and ten 20-liter drums of oil. He procures his goods in Bamako, Garalo, and in surrounding villages. \r\n\r\nThe cereals are stored in his store until a certain time. He resells them for cash to men and women customers who come from Sikasso and from Bamako.
