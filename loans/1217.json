Right now, it has a dirt floor and his son walks on the floor and it isn't very healthy for him. \r\n\r\nHis goal is to work hard and pay off the loan quickly in order to take out a bigger loan and make his house bigger.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1425348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to build a wall around the property and do some home improvement.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-07T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-07T14:20:06Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Amilcar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":47.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":51.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":55.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":59.47},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":62.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":63.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":65.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":71.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":78.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":85.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":88.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":104.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":603084,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"40-year-old Victoria lives in New Kru town which is one of the oldest communities in Liberia.

Her oldest child age is 30 and the last child age is 14.  \r\n\r\nShe has been operating a local restaurant in order to pay for her children's school, and maintain her home happily. She explains she is going to buy additional bags of rice, oil, pepper, charcoal, etc. Annie uses a shared taxi all the time to bring her goods to her local restaurant. She began her business right after her high-school days with a small amount of money which she gathered from her parents.\r\n\r\nShe is happy at her business because it is the only source of income and allows her to generate money to sustain her family. All her dreams and hopes are to one day be an owner of a big store, and see all her children through university.  She congratulates BRAC Liberia for their partnership with Kiva.

She attended grade school and stopped her study in the 6th grade. Her child lives with her and attends school. She explains how she has been going to the wholesale store to buy used clothes to resell in order to make ends meet. She sells from 8am to 5pm Monday to Saturday. She uses a taxi to get her goods from the store. She started this business by selling corn on the roadside with a little money from her mother, who taught her how to do this business. She expresses how she enjoys the buying, and she is proud of her business because she believes God directs more customers to her business every time. Her plan is to buy a piece of land and build a house. Also she hopes that her child will have a brighter future as she is trying her best to educate them. She gives thanks to the lenders of Kiva for supporting the program and empowering small business people; God should bless them.

She and her fianc\u00e9 are living together, and they have a six-year-old child who attends school. She lives in the Paynesville south area. She calls herself a businesswoman because she is business minded. She finished school after 1st grade. She has a shop where she sells goods such as soap, rice, toothpaste, sardines, oil, razor blades, batteries and drinks. Presently she is not facing many problems with her business, but she would like to increase her sales. She opens her shop from 7am to 10pm every day. She uses a taxi most of the time to take her goods to her shop. Mamie established this business by running a waiter market with a little money from her mother, and learned this way of selling from her friends. She enjoys selling to her customers and she is proud because her business is growing every day. She intends to buy additional goods to increase her sales. Her future plans are to build a house and send her only child to college. She says thanks to those who lend to BRAC Liberia, because \"it is through them that BRAC Liberia gives us money, and we are able to stand on our own.\"

The living conditions there are a bit difficult due to the high rate of crime, few bathrooms, filthy conditions and over population. But the most interesting parts of New Kru include the fact that rooms are a bit cheaper, there's the option to travel, and it contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia, and less rates of food.\r\n    \r\nCecelia is 48 years old, married, and her husband is not working. They both have five children, with ages between 25 and 15; only two of their children are currently attending school and live at home. Cecelia completed 12th grade before starting this business. She has been involved with the sales of used clothes in the local market. With the loan proceeds, she will buy more used clothes to make enough sales. She said she hopes to have fewer goods on her table in the market due to increased sales. With a little money from her mother she managed to establish this business 13 years ago and she learned how to run it from observing other businesswomen. \"I enjoy the flow of costumers\", she said.\r\n\r\nCecelia's dreams are to move from the table business to a shop business, build a house, and for her and her family to live better lives in future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1423679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She has been sewing and selling clothes to local people since 1998. Her husband provides transportation services and her son works as a sentry for a private company. The wooden house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair. So she is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, she and her husband will repair and insulate their old wooden house. The renovated house will reduce the overall usage of coal for heating thus releasing less pollutants into atmosphere which is significant contribution to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is very hardworking individual who wants to improve her family's life.

This is 35-year-old Mabinty from Rokupr from Northern area. She is married with 4 children between the ages of 2 years and 12 years. She began this business because she wanted to generate her own source of income to support the home.   \r\n\r\nShe runs a business of selling general stock items at her house. She sells cigarettes, milk, mayonnaise, pure water and drinks. She has been running this business for the past 5 years. She works at the business throughout the week from morning to night. Mabinty says that at present her business is doing fine.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan in order to buy more pure water, biscuits and drinks. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and take care of her family's welfare. In the future, Mabinty plans to expand her business more.

She gets up every day and does the daily household chores.  She makes her husband\u2019s lunch, and they then go to the field.  That is where they work together doing the different work like maintaining their crops.\r\n\r\nShe has two little children who do not go to school.  Her mother takes care of them while she and her husband are in the field.  Their coffee crops are four kilometers from their house.  They go there by foot every day.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to be able to continue expanding their coffee crops.  She wants to do this so that in the future her children will be able to inherit a decent and prosperous land.

gourmet food service, \"Splendishes by Shonali\". She required FDA approval, food labels, commercial kitchen space and ingredients and needed to hire her first two employees. These employees assisted with food preparation and allowed her to perform product demos to wholesalers.\r\n\r\nShonali has since produced a variety of award-winning items, most notably her horseradish mustard and red enchilada sauces, which won first and second places respectively at the Sonoma County Fair. Recently she has expanded into new product lines, such as kale chips, gourmet nuts and sweets. When asked how Kiva has impacted her business so far, she shared, \u201cGrowth is my biggest challenge, and it is frustrating to see huge businesses only get larger when small hardworking individuals are struggling to enter the market. \u2026 Kiva has helped me do that.\u201d\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Splendishes\u2019 reputation continues to grow in the community. Shonali recently garnered the attention of nearby Palomar Airport. Impressed by her cooking, a local pilot helped her secure catering contracts to private aircrafts. Although catering for flights is a lucrative opportunity for her, being on call from six in the morning until ten in the evening can be quite a challenge. She shared, \u201cI have to be able to cater at a moment\u2019s notice, so I always have to be prepared!\u201d \r\n\r\nShonali is confident that her second Kiva loan will open up even more opportunities for Splendishes to expand. She will use the funds to hire two additional employees to enable her business to meet increasing demand as well as have a presence at multiple farmers\u2019 markets simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIf all goes according to plan, Shonali hopes to ultimately have a commercial kitchen of her own instead of having to share a space with other companies. As for potential items available for sale in the future, Shonali says that she is open to making anything that delights her customers. \u201cI\u2019m always on the prowl to find something more delicious than what I made last!\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8500,"image":{"id":1185465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married and the mother of two children, who are 6 and 9 years old. Myleine's husband is a vegetable farmer and they work together to grow and sell their produce.

Co el fin de generar ingresos para apoyar el gasto familiar, decidi\u00f3 emprender un negocio de ventas de verduras con sus hermanos hace muchos a\u00f1os. Poco a poco su panorama de vida fue ampli\u00e1ndose y con ello sus posibilidades de generar mas utilidades, por eso decidi\u00f3 invertir en ranchos, v\u00edveres, refrescos, carnes y l\u00e1cteos, para venderlos al detalle, atendiendo que era una necesidad no satisfecha de sus vecinos en el barrio y de sus alrededores.

They live a municipality with a lot of artisan tradition and commerce in the Bol\u00edvar department.  In order to generate income to support the family expenses, she decided to undertake a business selling vegetables with her siblings several years ago.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, her life picture was expanding, as were her opportunities to generate more profits.  Therefore, she decided to invest in snacks, groceries, soft drinks, meat, and dairy products to sell on a retail basis.  She took note that this was a need that her neighbors and people in surrounding areas had that was not met.\r\n\r\nAs she located herself at a commercial spot where there was a small store, she managed to impact her clientele.  Now her desire to grow is unstoppable.  Her goal for later on is to manage to have a warehouse and to sell wholesale.  This way she would be stocking the small stores that exist in the area.\r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is not having enough working capital to manage to, little by little, fulfill her dream of prosperity.  However, as she has great discipline in her work, she has approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva loan.  With the loan she will buy products with greater turnover in larger volume and sell at better prices.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy snacks, groceries, soft drinks, and other basic needs items.  Her inventories will be well-stocked in order to impact her loyal customers and those that she has not yet met.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1424644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy snacks, groceries, soft drinks, and other basic needs items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-09-07T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-07T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1030000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82637},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92326},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95096},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":97949},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100887},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":103914},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":107031},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":110242},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":113549},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":126369}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.13,"local_amount":82637,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":85607.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083111},{"amount":49.3,"local_amount":92326,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-24T09:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":95644.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062453},{"amount":50.78,"local_amount":95096,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":98514.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732159},{"amount":52.3,"local_amount":97949,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":101469.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415380},{"amount":53.87,"local_amount":100887,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104513.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104524},{"amount":55.49,"local_amount":103914,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-02T09:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":107649.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919429},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":107135,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":110985.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140227},{"amount":58.87,"local_amount":110242,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":114204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834113},{"amount":60.63,"local_amount":113445,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":117522.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504260251},{"amount":67.48,"local_amount":126369,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":130911.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542527}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T13:51:54Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":603331,"name":"Khaled","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khaled is 29 years old; he lives in Gaza with his wife.

She lives with her mother and her three children in her very modes house, which has adobe walls, wood molding, a metal roof, and a natural floor.  She didn't have the opportunity to go to school because her parents didn't have the necessary resources to support her.  For this reason she learned to work the land, farming and growing coffee.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Emilia's plants are located on the same property where she lives, so the maintenance is easier and more regular.  Her oldest son helps her because the two younger ones are in elementary school.  They make their contribution, though, weeding and doing other things after they finish with their school activities.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Emilia has requested a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative to be able to buy agricultural inputs to take care of her plants and have an excellent harvest at the end of the season.  She's going to buy 3 quintals of formula 12-24-12, 2 quintals of formula 18-46-0, 2 quintals of urea, 2 quintals of coffee food, 2 quintals of coffee formula, 1 liter of insecticide, and 1 liter of Alto 10 SL.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Emilia plans to improve her coffee crop, increasing her plants with other, more attractive varieties that earn more in the market.  This way she'll be able to support her children in their studies so they can graduate and realize their goals and dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1425329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs for her coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T01:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T01:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":12233.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535587}],"funded_date":"2013-09-08T10:26:09Z","paid_date":"2014-09-19T09:53:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":603345,"name":"Valentina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentina lives in Jagna, Bohol with her family.

She and her husband are managing their household while operating their business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMa. Lourdes owns and oversees operations of their jeepney transportation business (see footnote). She has a one-unit jeepney (14 to 16 person capacity), which fills its daily quota of passengers each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney.\r\n\r\nMa. Lourdes hopes that her jeepney will always be in good condition, and she dreams that her children will have a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their lives and business every week.  There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. Jeeps were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipinos, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and with their ingenuity they modified the Jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every-day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet weekly. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay down their Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1424245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay for the spare parts and maintenance of her jeepney.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

aged 39, lives with her husband and five children in Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband provides services in which he changes vehicles' seat covers.  He purchases ready-made seat covers and also stitches them.  His shop is situated in the vehicles' workshop market. He has to capture his customers one by one and convince them to change their seat covers.\r\n\r\nHis business is going very well because he is expert and professional in his arts. He does not take much of his customers' time and quickly changes the seat covers. Previously, he was only providing services for motorbike seats; now he wants to provide services for various cars as well. For this purpose, he wants to buy various colors and types of Rexine (artificial leather fabric) so that he can also use his arts for car seats.\r\n\r\nFozia feels proud of her husband and is living very happily. However, she wants to financially help her husband by taking out a loan. Therefore, Fozia requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can buy various types of Rexine.\r\n\r\nFozia says thank you to Kiva and to its field partner, BRAC

previous loan was a big help in her business as she was able to buy the needed spare parts and accessories for her jeepney. Her income from the business was a big help in her children's education and in their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and to pay for the maintenance of their jeepney. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRosana hopes to have another jeepney and dreams of being successful in life. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies there. \r\n\r\n*Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers in helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese forces. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney: open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

He lives with his wife, two children and parents and grandmother in the small village of Kobuleti district. His grandmother is provided with a retirement pension. Archil has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Archil was unable to study a professional career. Archil works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize and nut trees. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. Besides this, he has a milking cow and produces dairy products to sell. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Archil decided to start his own business and sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.

She works approximately 10 hours every day and thinks it's going well for her because of her dedication.\r\n\r\nCarmen's very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help she'll buy a large quantity of clothes to sell so she can serve more customers.\r\n\r\nCarmen will continue to work and make the effort to achieve her big dream of having her own house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1424008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T12:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T12:30:01Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":199.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":210.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":215.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":227},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":232.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":241.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":257.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":261.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":272.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":282.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":293.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":304.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.54,"local_amount":199.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":200.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054775},{"amount":75.6,"local_amount":210.96,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":212.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819671},{"amount":77.25,"local_amount":215.59,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":217.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472590},{"amount":81.34,"local_amount":227,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":228.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695063},{"amount":83.42,"local_amount":232.8,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":234.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450391086},{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":241.86,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":243.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067565},{"amount":92.32,"local_amount":257.66,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":259.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880475},{"amount":93.63,"local_amount":261.28,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":262.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479104029},{"amount":97.8,"local_amount":272.92,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":274.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490799105},{"amount":315.43,"local_amount":880.28,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":886.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504222170}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T21:00:44Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:44:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":603383,"name":"Sokhon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokhon, age 42, is a garment worker.

She is married to Erwin, a caretaker, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRichie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  5-PHP's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also has a direct selling business and a piggery for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 9,000 PHP loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRichie dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

She began her business because as the second child of five, her parents were poor and could not afford to send all of them to school. She had the chance to attend school up to the secondary level, and therefore she is educated enough to read and write. She is using her educational background to operate her business successfully. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns a very respectable profit every month from this business. She would need a loan of GHS 1,700 to buy cream, quitters, perfume, wigs, weavon and other beauty products and resell to customers. In the future, she plans to improve her business and her family.

So far she does all her sewing by hand.  Since she has no sewing machine, it is very difficult for her to expand her production of dresses. So she has applied for this loan for help. \r\n\r\nArmine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit.

She is a single mother of two daughters, 6 and 9, and works on her own to provide them with the necessary. They go to the community school. Estela owns a separate house, but the children are close to the house and to their mother and her siblings in the same area.\r\n\r\nShe owns a business selling tortillas in her house that she manages independently. Before she worked as an employee near her house and there she learned the tortilla business. Later, after some time she decided to do it independently in her house, given that she knew it would be a profitable business to run. She gets up at 3 AM every day to prepare the corn and cook it in the wood oven. At 5 AM, she is already washing the corn in order to go to the mill at 6 AM. She enrolls and takes the girls to school at 7:30 AM. Her mother helps her with the production of tortillas for a while.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy corn and firewood. In these days corn is bought more cheaply because of the harvest of the winter cornfields of some farmers of the region. She will pay off a current balance in the CAMPO Foundation. Thereby she will be able to generate more income for her family and that her daughters are better and so that they are not lacking anything.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to have a successful business and that her daughters study and live well. She said that her childhood was hard: her mother made tamales to sell and she had to walk with the crate on her head through the entire neighborhood and she doesn't want this for her daughters.\r\n\r\nShe wants to see if little by little she can improve the house and to construct it of brick or cinderblock, because where she lives now it's made of sheet metal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1425514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Thirteen years ago, Matluba started a business, not a farming or herding business like many villagers, but rather in selling children's clothing.  Since she lives in a rural area she has little competition and it is easy for her to be successful in her business.  She buys her goods wholesale at a large city market and retails her goods from her own shop.

The plight of many women when it comes to firewood and charcoal can be likened to that of Lucy.\r\n\r\nLucy, second from right, is a middle aged woman. She is a mother of six and lives with her husband and her extended family. Lucy is a small scale farmer practicing dairy farming and owns a small piece of land where she grows food crops.

Her husband works seasonally as a casual laborer to add to the family income.\r\n\r\nHer main source of fuel is kerosene for lighting, as well as firewood and charcoal which are illegally acquired from the forest. This comes with a lot of challenges like women being sexually harassed by the forest guards, sometimes being arrested for trespassing forest reserves, sometimes being attacked by wild animals, and many other challenges. With the heavy load they have to carry they also develop back and joint problems.\r\n \r\nWith the campaign against deforestation in Mount Kenya forest, Lucy and her friends decided to have a biogas plant installed for them and they approached VEP for advice. Due to their many financial commitments, especially school fees for the kids and feeding the family, they opted for a biogas loan. With biogas Lucy and the others will save on fuel cost for cooking and lighting. They will also promote afforestation and a clean environment.\r\n\r\nLucy\u2019s immediate and extended family will also benefit from the bio slurry which will be used as fertilizer on the farm. In the end, she will save more money for her basic needs and will be in a better position to repay the

She met her husband after high school and he now works at a poultry plant.  He is in charge of taking care of the chickens and managing the coops.  Sara and her husband are the parents of an eight-month-old son.  They live with her parents.  \r\n\r\nSara requested a Kiva loan last year so that she could open a store in her parents\u2019 home.  Her mother previously owned a store that did very well, which is the reason why she requested a loan.  After she gave birth to her son, Sara was not physically able to attend to a business.  For now, she is only able to sell rechargeable mobile phone cards from her house and also cosmetics through magazines.  She has always enjoyed working in retail businesses.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she is requesting now, Sara will pay the outstanding balance of her previous loan.  The rest will be used to start a business that consists of selling clothes for all ages.  In order to buy inventory, she will travel approximately 120 kilometers round trip since the place where she buys clothes sells them at a much cheaper price.  Sara will also sell cheese that she plans to purchase in the city since the wholesalers offer a quality product at a good price.  She will still maintain her business of selling rechargeable phone cards and cosmetics through magazines.  With this loan, she hopes to establish herself financially and help her husband with the household expenses.  Since her son is still young, her expenses are numerous and much higher.  Her husband\u2019s salary cannot go any higher since he is already exhausted and they would like to live a little.

She lives with her husband and four children. The family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow and a calf. She milks the cow every day and produces dairy products for sale. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land, where they have 300 nut trees. They sell the harvested nuts at a good price. As the income is only seasonal and is not enough for covering the expenses, Sophiko decided to start her own business and seek for credit among local financial institutions. Her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe startup loan program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Sophiko's application was approved under the framework of this program, to get a loan of 800 GEL. With the received credit, she will start trading in clothing. Sophiko plans to go to Turkey and purchase clothing at wholesale prices, and then resell the goods at higher prices among her fellow villagers. This will increase the income of her family.

30-year-old Aminata from Moribatown, Sierra Leone. She is the mother of one child who is a year old. She went into the business of selling plastic slippers in 2008 to earn enough money to survive. She works at her business 10 hours per day and seven days per week, and says that her main challenge is price inflation. Aminata is requesting this loan to buy more plastic slippers to sell so that she can expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to meet this goal as well as pay her child's school fees. In the future, Aminata plans to open a shop.

Once she set a goal of opening her own business in animal husbandry.  She acted upon her goal and now, 10 years later, she is still raising large cattle.  She is always helped by her loving husband, her children and daughters-in-law.  She learned how to take care of cattle when she still lived with her parents before she was even married.

She lives with two of her seven children in the house that she first rented 12 years ago. 12 years ago, when she started her family, she began farming her mother-in-law's land an hour away from where she lives. There she grows various crops such as peas, potatoes, olluco and oca (olluco and oca are types of Peruvian root vegetables), which she takes care of each weekend, awaiting the harvest. The other days she does farm work in which she does milking and is paid a monthly salary. This helps her with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nFor that reason Mercedes wants to improve her harvests, as by selling her crops in the city of Pampas, she gets considerable income. But she wishes to obtain greater income, which she will get through improving the quality of her crops. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva, and in all this time she has obtained the money necessary to invest in developing her business.

is Liezel, 42, resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Arthur, who works on a maintenance staff, and she is a mother to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nLiezel maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers rely on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy additional supplies and products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other items needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLiezel hopes to have her own stall and dreams of being successful in life and business. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He lives in a rural area.  Upon finishing school locally, Abdunabi started study at an institute of international languages.  It was difficult for him to study because there were constantly problems with finances in his family.  After completion of his third year of study, he took a sabbatical and decided to move to China for work.  Once he completed his university studies, Abdunabi decided to remain in China to work, and there earned good money.  However, Abdunabi's mother became seriously ill and he returned home to take care of her and provide necessary medications.  From that moment he decided that he would not leave his homeland again, and that he would always stay near to his mother.  He soon married, and within a year a baby was born.  Abdunabi and his wife are happily married.  In his town he found work with a Chinese building organization, where he works in a laboratory.  His wife does not yet work; she stays with the small baby and looks after the home.  This year they decided to do repairs on their house, but Abdunabi does not have enough money for the repairs.  He therefore turned to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to purchase building supplies to repair his home.  He and his family wait and hope for a positive result, and he thanks Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1421529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials for his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-08T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-08T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdunabi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":227.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":235.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":243.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":252.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":261.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":270.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":279.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":289.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":299.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":310.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":321.19},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":332.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":344.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":356.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":368.58},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":386.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":603557,"name":"Kadiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!
