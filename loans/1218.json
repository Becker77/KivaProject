She has been working as an operator at a carpet factory since 2011. Her husband also works at the same factory and he has held the position of assistant overseer for over nine years. Their children all study at university. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam. Her house has deteriorated over the years and she wants to renovate it before winter. After renovation, her family can live in a comfortable and warm place where they don't need to burn much coal for heating. The burning of coal is considered to be the main cause of air pollution and the reduction of it will contribute to the efforts against air pollution as less pollutants are released into the atmosphere. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

Last year she opened a grocery store and in one year she developed regular customers. Her husband transports goods between cities using his truck. Mongolian winter, known as the most cold and harsh in the world, is coming soon. So Mrs. Tsetsegmaa has decided to build a house on her land before winter. She is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam. The high quality house is more comfortable and warmer than a Mongolian traditional ger. Last winter the family burned lots of coal for heating. If they were lived in house, the amount of coal burned would have been halved. The burning coal is the main source of air pollution according to the research department of Mongolia.

He lives in a small mountain town.  Bakhtier is married and has two children.  He raises and fattens cows, sheep, and goats, and also slaughters cattle and sells meat.  This is his family business that has been passed down from generation to generation.  Bakhtier sells beef and lamb at the local market and for this has his own butcher shop.  Beef and mutton fat is also available for sale.  Bakhtier also sells processed leather derived from the hair of the cattle.  2 times a week Bakhtier purchases cattle for slaughter and sells the meat.  He has regular customers who purchase meat to eat, cook, and sell.  This business provides Bakhtier with a good income, but the needs of his family are constantly increasing as his children grow.  Bakhtier therefore wants to expand his business in order to make a larger profit.  For this he turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to purchase cattle.

They have three children and live in their own house. Initially, Pelayo made a living in agriculture but now he has a grocery store in the public market where he lives. \r\n\r\nHe started his business with little merchandise as a test in a small establishment, but when he achieved good profits he converted it into his principal livelihood. He has the pleasure of offering his customers, mostly housewives and restaurant managers, a wide variety of fresh produce, as well as the provisions and grains that are most commonly consumed. He manages to achieve a good profit through these products. \r\n\r\nHe feels very happy with how his business is developing, since his wife is responsible for attending to customers during peak hours and restocking the merchandise, in this manner ensuring a well-organized business. He has almost 24 years of experience in this field and through today he has been very motivated in achieving his long-term goals.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with Kiva and he is grateful for the financial support he receives to move forward. Additionally he promises to make his payments on time. On this occasion, he would like 4,000 nuevos soles to buy wholesale merchandise such as rice, grains, fresh produce, sacks of potatoes, among other things to maintain a well-stocked business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1426101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery products such as rice, grains, fresh produce and sacks of potatoes, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T03:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T03:30:01Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pelayo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":583.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":646.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":644.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":688.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":711.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":726.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":438.13,"local_amount":1229.84,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1230.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905536},{"amount":229.48,"local_amount":644.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T10:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":644.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091522},{"amount":245.31,"local_amount":688.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":689.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778119},{"amount":253.39,"local_amount":711.26,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-25T09:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":711.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598526},{"amount":258.69,"local_amount":726.16,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T09:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":726.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147474}],"funded_date":"2013-10-01T08:01:48Z","paid_date":"2014-08-02T09:59:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie N.","image":1077468}},{"id":602966,"name":"Benkadi 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe BENKADI 1 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 52 ans, 5 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles polygames \u00e0 NIMPRODIOULA, un des villages de SIKASSO, 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur sixi\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution, les pr\u00eats pass\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9s.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est : le pois sucr\u00e9 avec Mme  SALI SIAKA  debout en deuxi\u00e8me position de la gauche  vers la droite sur la photo. \nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter le labour, la semence et les engrais  pour entretenir 0,5.

","en":"Petrona is 65 years old. She is the mother of 6 daughters and a son. She lives in the community where her parents raised her. She comes from a family of 5 siblings (2 brothers and 3 sisters), who now have their own families. For reasons of life, she did not go to school, since her parents told her that her schooling was work in agriculture. Thus she grew up in this environment, planting corn, beans, and sorghum, and also raising pigs.\r\n\r\nShe married at the age of 17, and from this relation she had 6 daughters, who now have their own households. She lives alone in the community. Five daughters live near her home, and the oldest lives in Guatemala. Her husband died about 25 years ago. The only son that she had died in the war that the country suffered in the 80s.\r\n\r\nShe previously went to Guatemala, since there her daughter has a little farm where she fattens chickens, where she learned this work, and she also does this in the community, although on a smaller scale. She also learned to raise and manage pigs together with her daughter.\r\n\r\nTo acquire the supplies for the pigs, the chickens, and the crops, she goes to the nearest city, which is 40 minutes from her house. To take the bus, she has to walk along paths to arrive at the road.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't have any fixed schedule to do her work, since she needs to be attentive at every moment (to raise pigs and fatten chickens). When she buys the supplies for the farm and raising beans, as well as when she buys concentrate for the chickens and the pigs, she is accompanied by one of her daughters.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is applying for is to buy fertilizers for planting 3500 square meters of corn and another 3500 of beans, and three pigs to raise and fatten. She will invest the rest in various household expenses.\r\n\r\nWith that she intends to assure her food supply and obtain economic income to improve her quality of life. She dreams of building an adobe house, since her present house is of wattle and daub.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she intends to obtain better economic income for herself and to help her daughters, who are

Odisha, India, stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their families with their contributions. They formed a group named Baba Biswakarma to access credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing businesses. Prior to this loan, the members have already taken their 4th loan from Mahashakti Foundation and have visibly developed their businesses with 100% repayment.  \r\n\r\nJayamala is the one standing third from the right with her hand raised in the photo. She is 46 years old and lives with her husband, two sons of 28 & 22 years and one daughter of 25 years of age. Jayamala hails from a traditional cloth weaving community. She has been running a cloth weaving business with her husband. Presently she has twelve hand looms for weaving saris. At the time of her first loan, the number of hand looms was four. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader 20 km away.  \r\n\r\nJayamala has engaged ten workers for the initial processing and weaving of saris. She only produces saris because of the demand in the market. Jayamala gets 15 lengths of sari per day. A bundle of yarn costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees and it produces 80 to 100 saris.She sells her products to the local traders, who come to take the finished product  from her home on a weekly basis. From this business she earns a monthly income of Rs.10,000, which is not sufficient to materialize her future dream. \r\n\r\nWith the present loan of 48,000 INR, she wants to buy thread\/yarn in bulk. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing and transportation costs of the raw materials. Jayamala wishes to grow her business and save enough to start a dyeing unit of her own. This will help her to do dyeing as per her wish and also fetch some extra income by dyeing others' yarn. Jayamala also hopes to arrange the marriage of her son and daughter in a respectable way.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Ahalja, Gunjamati and Harabati, doing grocery wholesale, cloth weaving and a sweet items making and supply business respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1424934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhuliasikuan,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jayamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gunjamati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ahalja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":192000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":192000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-15T00:46:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":603793,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia, 56 years old and married, works very hard to provide for her family.

He lives alone in a rented adobe house.  He arrived 15 years ago from the central mountain range in the country in order to look for a better future and to get ahead.  That was how he started seeking diverse work opportunities.  He managed to get hired as a day worker on different parcels of land of people that he knows.  He did different jobs in the production and sale of organic cacao in his area.\r\n\r\nHe says that he decided on this business activity because of the demand for work that exists and for the good income that he gets for each season.  However, on occasion he needs to deal with external factors like the rain in order to complete the jobs that are given to him.  He is known for being very hard-working and responsible.\r\n\r\nEven though he is independent, he has diverse needs which range from having his own house and covering basic expenses.  He plans to continue working with all of the motivation needed.  He wants to manage to get his own farm land upon which he hopes to produce organic cacao.  This is because it is a very important crop, and it provides good earnings.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with Kiva.  He is grateful for the financial support that he is getting in order to get ahead.  He pledges to make his payments punctually.  This time he wishes to have 3,000 soles.

She started this business with a little money from her husband two years ago. She said fewer goods on her table is the only challenge she faces now. She likes her business because it is affordable, and she learned this way of selling from her friends.

She has been running a small vegetable farm while also managing a grocery shop.  Doris is asking for a Kiva loan so that she can buy a water pump to help irrigate and expand her small farm.\n\nUsing buckets, Doris has been drawing water from a nearby well to water her fields of green maize and onions.  Over the past two years she has been selling her produce to markets in the nearby cities of Kabwe and Lusaka.  While she wants to expand her farm further, she currently lacks a water pump.\n\nWater pumps can be a major boost for small farmers such as Doris.  A water pump allows for farmers to water their crops more regularly, while also increasing the area they are able to cultivate.  Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a water pump can be very prohibitive.  Once she secures a loan, Doris will be able to get a water pump from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to her farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it.\n\nWith a water pump Doris hopes to significantly expand her farm, while still having time to manage her small shop.  She hopes to use the new profits from her farm to improve her shop while also support her children in school.  It is for this reason that Doris is asking Kiva lenders to assist her with a loan so that she can secure a water pump as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1425889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to obtain a water pump for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chibombo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":2610,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193.49,"local_amount":1010,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-25T08:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449731672},{"amount":139.84,"local_amount":730,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-24T08:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":746.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459769246},{"amount":51.72,"local_amount":270,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-21T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":276.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468036055},{"amount":76.63,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":409.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479254258},{"amount":38.32,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":204.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504389289}],"funded_date":"2013-09-09T22:16:20Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T17:23:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":603852,"name":"Kadzo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kadzo is a married woman with six children.

She is growing tomatoes, greens, okra and winter maize and has dreams of growing more, but currently lacks a water pump to manage a larger field. \n\nWater pumps can be a major boost for small farmers such as Ethel.  A water pump allows for farmers to water their crops more regularly, while also increasing the area they are able to cultivate.  Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a water pump can be very prohibitive.  Once she secures a loan, Ethel will be able to get a water pump from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to her farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it.\n\nEthel plans to sell her new crops to a larger market in Kabwe where she can fetch a better price.  With the new profits, Ethel plans to support her children in school.  It is for this reason Ethel is asking Kiva lenders to assist her with a loan so that she can secure a water pump as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1425964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to obtain a water pump for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kabwe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ethel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":2610,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180.08,"local_amount":940,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-25T08:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":961.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449731673},{"amount":153.25,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-24T08:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":818.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459769247},{"amount":112.07,"local_amount":585,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-21T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":598.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468036056},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":280,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":286.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517890734}],"funded_date":"2013-09-09T20:27:50Z","paid_date":"2014-08-18T09:32:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":604715,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes es una se\u00f1ora muy trabajadora y dedicada a su casa, ella se dedica a vender tostadas de yuca y pl\u00e1tano y as\u00ed mismo fresco de horchata.

She lives with her three children, the eldest works as a day worker and bricklayer's assistant and the others go to the local school and support her financially. She only reached the fourth grade at school as she had to work from a young age.\r\n\r\nShe makes tortillas for a neighbour every day from 7am until 2pm and at the weekends she sells things at home with her daughter. They sell drinks and snacks to people who pass buy and players from a local football court. She has a lot of experience in commerce, having worked her whole life since she was a young girl and since getting married she has enjoyed working in this industry. Previously, she had a school cafe and a tortilla business in the city when she was with her husband. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting, is to start a business buying and selling clothes for all ages and making pupusas at weekends, this will let her have a better income as she works hard and struggles to survive with her children. If the business is her own she will earn more as at the moment she works without seeing the results.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the loan is to have the necessary income for financial stability in the business as this year her daughter will graduate with a basic level of education, next year she will start at secondary school and will need money for the journey and food. She also hopes that her younger son will continue studying and prepare academically so he will have better opportunities in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1426236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to start a business buying and selling clothes for all ages and to make pupusas at the weekend.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T18:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T18:50:15Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":34.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.15,"local_amount":27.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":27.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090971},{"amount":28.8,"local_amount":28.8,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":28.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856923},{"amount":430.38,"local_amount":430.38,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":430.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505186},{"amount":13.67,"local_amount":13.67,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:08Z","rounded_local_amount":13.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621896}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T17:15:06Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Godwin","image":null}},{"id":603863,"name":"Aleksandre","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aleksandre is a 48-year-old married man.

Sadiq and his wife are engaged in their own business in order to have the income to meet their family's needs. He has been engaged in cattle breeding for the past 13 years. During these years, he gained the necessary skills and knowledge for the effective management of his business. \r\n\r\nHe usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and then resells them for a profitable price in the livestock bazaar. He also makes homemade yogurt and sells it, together with fresh milk, to his neighbors. His monthly income is about 144 AZN. This business is the only source of financial income in his family.

The members are united and have been responsible in their dealings with the institution. Though one of the members, Mar\u00eda Altagracia, is 80, she works very hard. She is a widow and the mother of 12 grown children. For 60 years, she has been raising chickens and turkeys, a trade she learned from her mother. She makes traditional skirts, which are part of her community's culture, and she sells detergent. \r\n\r\nAltagracia travels to the city to buy merchandise to sell in her town, but she prepares the detergent herself with the chlorine she buys. She has applied for a loan to buy chlorine, which she will use to make detergent. Neighbors come to Altagracia's house to buy both chlorine and detergent. She says she used to sell linens in other towns, but, at her age, it's hard to travel. She says she doesn't face any particular problems in her businesses. She does her work enthusiastically to keep her long-time customers and to have some income to pay her household expenses. She lives alone.\r\n\r\nAltagracia's single dream is to keep working and keep the businesses she enjoys going. She is very grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund for the funding that has helped the members, Eulalia, Blanca Estela, Mar\u00eda Severiana, Isidro, and Yolanda, grow their businesses.

His mother milks the cows every day and produces dairy products for selling. Besides this, they have a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. Zaza sells the harvested products at local markets at a good price. As the income is only seasonal, he decided to get a loan and start his own business and seek for credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or restarting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of USD 3,000. With the received credit, he will purchase a minibus and start trading with fruits and vegetables.

Her husband supplies plastic raw material to manufacturers in different firms.  In fact he buys used plastic bottles and accessories from scrap dealers.  After washing and crushing them into small pieces, he sells it to the manufacturers for reshaping.  The manufacturers give it different shapes through compression molding machines.\r\nOne day while crushing a hard plastic bottle the crushing blade inside the machine became stuck.  Its blade was horribly damaged and needs replacement but he does not have enough money to buy a new crushing blade.  Therefore, Rubina requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan. Through the loan amount her husband will be able to buy a new crushing blade easily. \r\nRubina says thanks to Kiva because her husband does not have another source of

Afiza has a higher education.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 10 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Afiza's hard work, today her business contains five dairy cows and also 0.20 hectares of land, where she annually plants onions and gets a rich harvest.

Miller makes his living planting cacao, yucca and other products on his small farm.  For a long time, Miller suffered setbacks in his life as he did not have his own income to support his household.  And so, ten years ago he decided to start a new project with the goal of making a name for himself.  He thought that his fiends, neighbors and family would want to purchase products from his land, in accordance with the season.  He started his business and it is now doing very well.  Miller likes what he does, as it allows him to have time to take care of his animals and his household.  In addition, since he started his business, his finances are doing very well.  He now has money for his household, and he hopes to continue growing, which is why he is thinking of expanding his sales.  This is his first loan with Kiva.  He hopes to collaborate with Kiva to be able to continue with his objectives.  At the same time, he promises to punctually repay his loan.  With the requested sum of 1000 soles (USD $375), he will purchase organic compost for his sown fields.

She is single, and she is helping her parents manage their household. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nBreezy operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for every item in the store.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells shoes and belts for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nBreezy dreams of having another business and hopes to have good health.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their lives and business every week.  There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet every week.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay their Micro Finance

Nuimi works in agriculture, she sells her products such as pineapple, cacao, bananas, and others at the local market, this is where she offers them, services her customers nicely who in their majority are neighbors that recommend her to other people who with time become regular customers.  She started more than eight years ago with a private loan, buying and selling in small quantities, to then increase according to demand, up to this point she has done this on her own, but occasionally she hires workers for seeding and harvesting.  She comments that she likes this business because she knows about agriculture and decided to start due to the need to have her own income and have a trade, because the money for their children wasn't enough and they had economic difficulties.

Thanks to Gulgaky's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow, one heifer and one calf.  She also works on 0.60 hectares of land, where she annually plants clover.  The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).

Since 2007 she has been involved with a cook shop business, selling rice and soup. Most interestingly, she has many customers since she sells delicious Liberian food. She started her business with a loan from her husband and learned this way of selling from her friends. She spends eight hours on her business each day. Because the location of her shop is a bit far from her house, one of the problems she faces is vehicle traffic, which sometimes causes her to be late to open her cook shop. \r\n\r\nAnnetta is requesting a loan to buy food ingredients, such as pepper, fish, meat, vita (a juice drink) and oil, to expand her business. She plans to expand her business even more and educate her

She hails from a poor family living below the poverty line. The lady sitting in the middle in the photo raising her hand is Rupeswari, She is forty-eight years old and lives with her husband, one daughter of 22 years and one son of 25 years who help her in all activities. \r\n\r\nRupeswari has been running a small dry food vending business for the last eight years. Her husband travels to the six nearest villages for selling of dry food items like bread, rolls, and biscuits, etc. every day. Rupeswari earns a monthly income of 4,000 INR from the above business. With this income, she is hardly able to manage her household expenses. So, she wants to expand her business by taking out a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. With the present loan, Rupeswari wants to purchase more stock of bread, rolls biscuits, etc. This will help her to meet the demand of the customers. \r\n\r\nRupeswari hopes to save enough to construct a house of her own and do wholesaling of  dry food items. The other four members of the group are Rita, Pramila, Bati and Bisakha who are running   businesses like a tailoring centre, a general store, and milk selling and cloth vending respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1424960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing bread, rolls, biscuits, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Luthurbandh,Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T21:50:05Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bisakha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rupeswari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":62000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":62000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-12T06:45:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":603965,"name":"Ergashaly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ergashaly is an entrepreneur who is married and has 5 children.

She gets 5 liters of milk per day, which she supplies in the nearby town. Apart from this, she is working as a 4th grade employee in the Integrated Child Development Dept. of Govt. of Odisha. From the above two sources, Dushila gets a monthly income of 6000 INR. According to her, the present income is insufficient on her part to manage her household expenses.  So, as there is growing demand for milk in the locality, she has planned to utilize the present loan for purchasing another cow of improved variety to add some extra income to her family. Dushila says this will help her to add some extra income and she will be able to manage her family finances smoothly. Dushila has also a dream to develop a dairy farm in future.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of this group are Nilendri & Nabami with milk business, Dahane with goat trading, Jamuna with general store and Sukanti with vegetable cultivation and vending business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1424972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Mahulpada,Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-09-09T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-09T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dushila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dahane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilendri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sukanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":68000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":68000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-11T01:31:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":603823,"name":"Allaha Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group named Allaha was formed in the year 2013 by four women of Titilagarh town with an objective of accessing loans from Mahashakti Foundation for developing their existing businesses.

She's the mother of three children, and lives with her husband in Mandela, one of Sikasso's villages (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nFor more than seven years, she's been selling cereals. Her experience in this field earned her a good reputation, and she gets orders from a diverse clientele. In order to have the resources needed to satisfy her customers, she's been working with Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso, for four years.

She is the mother of four children and still lives with her \u200b\u200bhusband in Mandela. She has been in the business of buying and selling grain for more than 7 years. Her experience in this trade has earned her a good reputation, and she receives orders from a variety of clients. \r\n\r\nIn order to have the resources necessary to meet her clients' needs, Sitan partnered with Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. Her previous loans have been repaid. This new loan will allow Sitan to purchase fifteen 50-kilogram bags of fonio (an important species of millet that was among the first grains to be cultivated in West Africa) and five bags of maize. She buys her stock in the surrounding villages of Mandela and usually sells to men and women locally and in Sikasso. With this loan, she hopes to make an average monthly profit of 32,000 CFA francs per month. These profits will be used to pay the interest on her loan, and the rest will be reinvested in her business. She is counting on becoming a well-reputed wholesaler in order to satisfy her growing customer base.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1264716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase grains.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mandela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-10T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-10T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207721},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972412},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624963},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850970},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740637},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T09:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220220},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-23T09:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045176},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":26463.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263057}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T15:44:24Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T20:37:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Halpert","image":1306950}},{"id":604805,"name":"Anibal","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. An\u00edbal tiene 21 a\u00f1os, el  se dedica a la venta y servicio t\u00e9cnico de tel\u00e9fonos de celulares,  este pr\u00e9stamo es su primera secuencia dentro de la instituci\u00f3n, el Sr. An\u00edbal va a utilizar  este pr\u00e9stamo  para la compra de una vitrina para  la muestra de su mercader\u00eda y accesorios de celulares,  su raz\u00f3n para solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo es mejorar su negocio, El Sr. An\u00edbal enfrenta retos en su negocio que son tener una buena venta y  va a utilizar los beneficios en seguir comprando mercader\u00eda para seguir mejorando su negocio y as\u00ed de esta manera seguir generando m\u00e1s ingresos y por ende  mejorar su calidad de vida, Sr. An\u00edbal se siente feliz y agradecido por la oportunidad que le brindan ya que esta la \u00fanica actividad que permite mantenerse.","en":"An\u00edbal is 21 years old and works selling and servicing cell phones.
