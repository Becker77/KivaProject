She is the mother of two children aged 17 and 4 years old. The oldest has graduated from high school but can't enter university for financial reasons. So he's at home right now. The youngest is in kindergarten. Diana is responsible economically for both of them and works in family's homes or takes care of seniors. But her employment is sporadic. They live in a rented apartment without much luxury. Diana's income barely covers the household expenses so they must limit themselves in many aspects and go without in others. At this time her best prospect to get ahead and offer her family a better quality of life is through the education of both herself and her children. \r\n\r\nBesides her children Diana must also help her mother who is 56 years old. She is also a nursing aide but because of her age, social prejudices and the requirements of some institutions, she has not found any work. Fortunately she takes care of the two children while Diana is working or studying. \r\n\r\nDiana is an example of getting ahead and effort. She has carried on alone in the face of great adversity. Three years ago she separated from her husband for motive of mistreatment. She has not been in communication with the father of her children, not even to claim the economic recompense due to her by law. He does not work and she doesn't want to put her family through this type of experience. So she decided to continue alone. \r\n\r\nGiven this whole situation she considers the help offered her for her program at Campoalto, a respite from a difficult economic situation.

He likes this profession a lot and this is his motivation to continue on with his studies. At the moment he has no way to support his father, as neither has stable employment now. Giovanny Andr\u00e9s occasionally works in a bar on Friday nights from 11;30 pm until 3 in the morning. He has no fixed salary. Other than this his father works at night selling a variety of packaged foods from a push cart. They are going though a difficult time. His father lost his only means of working, something which can happen quickly and Giovanny Andr\u00e9s needs to continue studying. There is no economic resolution of any kind and of course he does not want to lose the opportunity that he has worked so hard for, that is to study. Since he graduated from High School he has dreamed of becoming a great engineer. For sure if he studies he will go far. This is what he wants, to be a great systems engineer. This is his passion and for this reason he doesn't want his efforts to be wasted.

Three of them are grown and her youngest (13 years old) is in high school and still lives with her.  Her husband works as a farmer.\r\n\r\nNarcisa is a good mother and wife who helps her husband with the household bills with a small store that she set up in her house with what little she had.  This is how they get by, since her husband makes very little as a farmer.  She works every day from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm and sometimes even later.  Her husband and son both help her with her work when they aren't busy.  She has had her business for 12 years and because of it she has been able to put her children through school.\r\n \r\nShe will use this loan to further stock her store.

Juana married her husband when she was 16 years old, and together they have four children: a girl, age 15, and three boys, ages 13, 9 and 5.\r\n\r\nJuana says that her family shares the different jobs to maintain their crops, and they work hard together everyday to get ahead.

She says it is the source of income for her family\u2019s basic needs. \r\n\r\nJuana says she owns the fields where she grows coffee, which are 7 kilometers from her home. The fields must be reached on foot because there are no roads for cars in the area. \r\n\r\nJuana says she dreams of increasing her assets and to be able to see her children with families and children of their own.

She started this work because she had no economic support for her son so she decided to get ahead by opening her own business.\r\n\r\nThis is her 4th Kiva loan and she feels grateful for the financial support she gets to continue moving forward.  She will use the requested 3,000 soles to buy products like perfume, body cream and clothes, among others.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1427269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-10T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-10T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":450.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":479.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":477.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":515.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":524.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":553.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333.17,"local_amount":929.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":934.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905553},{"amount":171.14,"local_amount":477.59,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T10:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":480.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091541},{"amount":184.57,"local_amount":515.08,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":517.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778136},{"amount":187.79,"local_amount":524.05,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-01T10:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":526.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598543},{"amount":198.33,"local_amount":553.49,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T09:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":556.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147490}],"funded_date":"2013-10-01T12:32:57Z","paid_date":"2014-08-02T09:59:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":605235,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia sigue dedic\u00e1ndose a su negocio de restaurante ,la socia es una persona responsable y empe\u00f1osa ,la socia prepara desayunos, almuerzo y cenas para sus clientes que le solicitan, la socia prepara diversos platos como arroz con pollo, estofados, sopas entre otros, cada d\u00eda varia la comida para sus clientes, la socia lleva a\u00f1os con su negocio el cual le trae satisfacciones tanto econ\u00f3micas como personales, la socia desea poder seguir trabajando para de esta forma pueda seguir apoyando a su familia.\nLa socia solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de insumos como arroz ,aceite y otros. \nLa socia se compromete a hacer sus pagos en el plazo establecido.\n","en":"This client continues working in the restaurant business.

This work has always appealed to her, and so two years ago she began her entrepreneur experience with her own business, after she finished her pattern-making and fitting studies, focusing especially on making bermudas, shorts, and multiuse outfits. With her business and with the money that her husband, who works as a worker in a business, contributes, they generate sufficient income to take care of the household expenses. Their household includes two children, ages 4 and 6. Currently, Maira is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing that Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo is giving. With this she will buy a tabletop sewing machine and an overlock sewing machine, because her goal is to expand her workshop, and eventually to have her own home. Maira works painstakingly everyday, from 8 in the morning to 7 at night (including two hours of rest), from Monday to Saturday. Her primary customers are the shops in the area, who have placed orders with her and whom she gladly takes care of

She has been in this career for 36 years.  When a friend taught her the trade, she was able to support her family.  One year ago, Nancy started her own, independent business venture with the hope of increasing her family's income.  That is why her current goal is to completely develop her beauty salon's potential, to have modern equipment and convert her salon into a sizable business.  Nancy currently works from 9 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock at night.  She runs a cash business and offers her services every day to both regular customers and walk-in customers who are referred by her current clients. Nancy purchases her supplies in wholesale warehouses, which offer better prices.  It works out well for her, as she can then offer her services at competitive prices.  Nancy is requesting a credikiva, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will purchase raw materials and supplies like shampoo and conditioner and workplace equipment like an air conditioner, a display case and a service door.  With the investment, Nancy hopes for a substantial improvement in the service she can offer her customers by increasing both their comfort and their well-being.

For this reason she asks for the lenders support in collecting a loan of USD 3,000 to buy three more cows. As this is Angela's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who haven't had access to credit products before, because they have no credit history.

She and her husband have four children. Nurapa has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Nurapa is raising livestock and growing farm produce, having launched 19 years ago by buying cattle for 10,000 KGS. Thanks to Nurapa\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes one dairy cow, one , and 20 sheep. She also has a land plot of 2.09 ha [about 5.2 acres], where she grows beans every year. Nurapa\u2019s monthly income is 10,000 KGS.

As a child, Patricia\u2019s passion was always in the cake decorating business.\r\n\r\nNow, a successful 53-year-old, Patricia offers a variety of custom baked-to-order cakes for the El Paso community.  Customers are able to pick and choose what kind of cake and frosting they want, design and color, and anything else a person can dream up.  Patricia also caters to her customers who are conscientious about their health.  Many of her cakes are gluten and sugar-free and sold to physical trainers, diabetics, and health gurus.\r\n\r\nAccion Texas Inc., a nonprofit micro and small business lender, helped Patricia\u2019s business, Angeli Cakes. After Patricia was referred to the microlender when visiting True Credit, a business specializing in credit restoration, she received a loan to purchase additional baking equipment, supplies, cake mix

They average 50 years of age. They are married with an average of three children each. They run different businesses such as the buying and selling of grains and vegetables for making sauces. In the image, Kossira is the first seated person from the right to the left of the photo. They live in large traditional families in Tiele in the prefecture of Baguineda (Koulikoro region, Republic of Mali). They have been in small business for several years and are very sought after in their businesses. In the interest of satistfying the growing needs of their clientele, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago. They are on their third group loan. Kossira, who is the president of the group and very well known in Tiele, excels in the sale of vegetables for sauces. She expects to use her loan to purchase different types of vegetables for making sauces (peppers, tomatoes, onions, cabbage and Maggi bouillon cubes). She stocks up in Bamako from the wholesalers and resells in Tiele, at retail, for cash and for credit to a clientele made up of men and women. She hopes for a monthly profit of 20,000 f CFA, a sum which will allow her to repay the loan and reinvest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1424424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase vegetables for making sauces.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"TIELE","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-10T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-10T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kossira  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nakeni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207727},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972419},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624969},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850977},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740643},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":101702.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220227}],"funded_date":"2013-09-11T00:42:04Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:36:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Martha Schmitz","image":489893}},{"id":604327,"name":"Rosalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a widowed parent of five children, Rosalia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a buy-and-sell rice business in the Philippines and also earns additional income from a general store.

To earn an income and support his family, he has a business through which he makes a living selling chicken and other various merchandise.\r\n\r\nHis business started when he got the opportunity to buy a freezer.  With this, he started selling frozen chicken in his neighborhood community.  This first experience went very well for him, he was well received among his neighbors, and little by little he grew his clientele.  He takes advantage of this to sell them various merchandise, adapted to their needs, such as clothing and footwear.\r\n\r\nWualdimiro buys and sells chicken daily, and in the case of the merchandise, he does it every 2 weeks, buying in other cities where he travels.

","en":"Ziregul is 25 years old and she is divorced with two children (one daughter, one son).  In 2002 she launched a business selling children's goods with a starting capital of 6,000 som (KGS).  Since she has managed to increase her business and attract regular clients, Ziregul has an average monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).

Sometimes he leaves during the night to work on minor mechanical jobs.  With what little income he earns, he is able to pay for expenses such as food and the cost of basic services for his family.  \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used for repairs to his auto repair shop.  He wants to have more work space so that he can improve his earnings and service more vehicles that are in need of repairs or maintenance.  \r\n\r\nTeofilo dreams of expanding his shop by adding a shed so that he does not have to work in the open air where the sun or rain could slow down his work.  This is the sixth time he has requested a loan from IMPRO, but the third time from Kiva.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1022754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional repairs to his auto repair shop.

The potential of tutors and all the resources available for studies at AUCA attracts almost everyone to apply there. \n\nI live in a family of six: my parents, three siblings and myself. My parents both work, but my brother goes to school and my little sister goes to a kindergarten, which also has some expenses. Therefore my parents are not able to cover my tuition fees fully. I am applying for a Kiva loan which will help me to cover my tuition fees.

Now we also have a loan, which was taken to buy a house for us.\n\nAll the above-mentioned made it necessary for me to apply for financial aid, to be able to get quality education at the American University of Central Asia. I plan to become a professional in the field of Business Administration. To study at AUCA is one of my dreams, and I hope I will be lucky enough to get funded. For this reason I am applying for a KIVA loan, so that it would be easier to cover my tuition at AUCA.\n\nI will do my best to be a role model student of AUCA and play an active role in AUCA social life. The knowledge that I will get at AUCA will definitely give me a chance to make a significant contribution to the development of my region and my entire country.

This is her story:\n\nMy name is Zhamilia. I have graduated from high school this year and enrolled at the American University of Central Asia. I am applying for a Kiva loan to be able to cover my tuition fees. A Kiva loan gives an opportunity to people like me to pursue education at AUCA or other Universities. Lack of money impedes the process of education since you start thinking only about the money you have to pay; consequently, problems in studies occur. It is hard for my parents to cover tuition fees for three children and I would therefore like to take the opportunity that AUCA gives to its students and apply for a Kiva loan.  \n\nSince I was in ninth grade, I have dreamed about entering the best University not only in Kyrgyzstan, but in all of Central Asia. So, I have chosen AUCA because its unique features will guarantee me an opportunity to reach my learning goals. Also, educational instruction is given in English. From childhood, I have always liked this language and the chance to study in English would be magnificent. I have a keen interest in studying Journalism and Mass Communications because I have a big interest in photography and writing. I realized what field I wanted to study last year and had an immense desire to become part of JMC department at AUCA, and my dream came true.\n\nAUCA gives the best education in Central Asia. I will be able to help not only my family, but also my country while becoming a good specialist of the area that I have chosen. I am very enthusiastic about volunteering, which became an excitement when I first did community service in the USA. Comparing my country to others, I see that our economics are so weak and I would like to bring a change and give better conditions to my descendants. \nI will highly appreciate your assistance and want you to believe in my abilities because I always try my best in everything.

This is her story:\n\nMy name is Anastasia. It is my dream to study at AUCA, in the Journalism and Mass Communication Department. I enrolled in the AUCA Department of JMC this year and feel very excited about that. Attending the university in this program is the first step towards my future career as a reporter. I have dreamt of being in the field of Journalism since I saw TV news for the first time. AUCA is the best place to get higher education in the area of Mass Media because of the high quality of education and it is a chance to meet and interact with people from all over the world. \n\nI have always maintained excellent records whether it is academic activities in school or some competitions. Sports taught me not to give up, but I am quite confused about my expectations because of financial matters. So I would like to apply for financial support to AUCA.\n\nI am applying for a Kiva loan as my family cannot afford to fully cover the tuition fees. We have thought about AUCA since the first time we heard about it from our acquaintance. My parents saved money for my future education. Time has elapsed but our funds are not very big because of appropriate outcomes. Our family consists of four people: my parents, grandmother, and I. Only my mother has a permanent job but it is not a full time job, and the income varies. My father is a seasonal worker, so his income depends on certain seasons. I am a schoolgirl.  I could earn extra money, but this way I would have less time for studies and would not keep up with my class. All I can do now is to get good knowledge that will help me in my future. \n\nI will take part in all AUCA extracurricular activities with alacrity in which my participation can contribute to something useful for the university.

I graduated from high school this year and enrolled in the university of my dream \u2013 American University of Central Asia. \nI am looking for financial aid on Kiva's website to be able to cover part of my tuition fees. \n\nThe main problem of the young generation in getting higher education is lack of resources. And it is not only in Kyrgyzstan; it is all over the world. Millions of smart brains stay in the shade, and only some of them can reach to the light. Unfortunately, not many of us were lucky to be born into a family which can afford a high level of life style. In fact, statistically teenagers from poor families can reach many more achievements because they were taught to survive hardship since they were kids. If they get an opportunity, they do a lot to make it happen. \n\nI have chosen the American University of Central Asia so I can best apply the knowledge that I have gained so far. I was born to be a leader. The fact that I am the president of our class increases my chance of studying in such a university. I am a debater and experienced that during the last year. I also take part at Tech Age Girls program under IREX. This program gave me a lot of basic knowledge in IT resources. I also became more independent and democratic.  Thus, I would surely say that I could contribute a lot to the social life of the University as well.\n\nThe only problem is that my family is not able to pay the whole amount of the tuition fees, which is the reason that I am applying for a Kiva loan. \nI hope that I will get such an opportunity and I am ready for the challenge of a new environment. I am ready to devote myself to studies and to the social life of the AUCA. It is my firm belief that I can make a huge contribution to the economy of Kyrgyzstan.

She traveled to another place and started a relationship with a young man.  As a result, a beautiful baby was born.  However, her happiness was short-lived because everything she believed to be beautiful and lovely suddenly ended.  \r\n\r\nAt that point, she decided to return to her family but moving back home would be problematic since they lived in an area with a high level of violence.  On the way back, she ran into an armed group and decided to head toward a cold city where she practically knew no one.  Yet there were still opportunities to start from scratch, so she decided to finish her studies and pursue nursing.

She is the mother of four children, three of whom live with her and are in school. The oldest no longer lives at home. She completed primary education. Her partner is her only support for the different farming activities. He works in a \"maquila\" [a manufacturing operations free-trade zone] as a sewing operator. \r\n\r\nAt a very young age, Gladis started to learn all of the different farming activities related to caring for and growing coffee. Her parents began to teach her to farm when she was young because it is a family tradition. The land where she works along with her children and partner is their own, thanks to an inheritance from her parents. They bought the other part of land, and it is located an hour's walk way. They invest time in cutting and collecting beans as a family.\r\n\r\nGladis's dreams are to become one of the best coffee producers of her region, to be able to export her product to other countries, and to generate employment and income for her family and her household. As a mother, she wants to give her children an excellent education up to a high level, with which they will be able to deal with problems well and be someone in their lives. For this reason, she asked for a loan from the COMIXMUL co-operative, in order to buy agricultural inputs. These will help her to grow her coffee crops and nurseries, and to develop quality seeds for the final purchasers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1427388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy inputs to grow her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-11T14:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-11T14:10:10Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis Ondina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.2,"local_amount":3.96,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833752},{"amount":0.79,"local_amount":15.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":16.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042214},{"amount":6.01,"local_amount":120.21,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":122.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490813023},{"amount":442.83,"local_amount":8856.67,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T09:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9029.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535657},{"amount":175.17,"local_amount":3503.08,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3571.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542499102}],"funded_date":"2013-09-11T17:32:08Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aesclinn Donohue","image":1310197}},{"id":604458,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene is 30 years old and has two children.

Nairobi, Kenya. Due to his responsibility to provide for his family, Jacob runs a small egg supplying business in his neighborhood. He is also the chair of a local self-help group, which pools funds to help members invest in or start businesses. Because of his active participation in community activities and his desire to provide for his family, Jacob has singled out various business ideas which he believes will generate enough income to enable him and his family to live in comfort.

On average they are 40 years old with three children. They all live in the village of N'djebougouni in the Segou region (the fourth administrative region of Mali) and met through neighbourhood activities, family, and their business contacts in the village. They sell rice, Shea butter, groundnuts, and children's clothing. Hoping to increase their trade, the members of the group decided to join Soro Yiriwaso and this is their second solidarity loan. Mrs. Sadio (the woman sitting in the middle of the front row in the photo), is an important rice seller in N'djebougouni and the surrounding area. She plans to use her loan to buy two bags of rice from her supplier in Segou. The resale is made for cash or credit from her home to her clientele of men and women.

In particular, they have two milking cows and they produce dairy products to sell. In addition, they have a vineyard and they produce and sell wine. \r\n\r\nIn the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living.  So, Tornike decided to start his own business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. His credit requests were rejected several times since he was unable to satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nTornike received a credit in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up program gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start their businesses.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan of GEL 7,000, Tornike will build a greenhouse and grow cucumbers and tomatoes there. He will purchase the seeds and all the building materials to build a greenhouse. He will sell the harvested products locally, at a good price. This will increase the income of his family.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
