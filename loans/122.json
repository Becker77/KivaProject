Her ambition is to generate more income and take better care of the people she looks after. Her main challenge is low sales volume, but she is optimistic that she can turn it around by acquiring a loan to purchase an additional dairy cow. Lenah finds keeping dairy cows to be a fun experience, besides it being a means of self-sufficiency and food security. With the loan, Lenah will get surplus dairy products from the cow, which could bring her extra income to keep up with raising family expenses.

They call their group Tamaraneh III, a Temne word that means, \"Let us help each other.\" They have received several loans from Kiva through SMT and always repay them successfully. Their previous loan was for Le 500,000 each and this helped them a lot. They were able to earn more profit after the loan and solve many of their problems. Today, they are requesting a loan of Le 500,000 each to add to their businesses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isatu (pictured on the right) is the leader of this group. She was born in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. She is thirty-three and a widow with two children. One of her children is in secondary and one in primary school. She has been a businesswoman for the past ten years now. She sells ground-nuts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this loan of Le 500,000, Isatu will now be able to buy a one and half bags of ground-nuts to add to her business. Before now she could buy only baskets of ground-nuts because of low capital. She travels to Bamoi near the neighboring country of Guinea to buy the ground-nuts. The price per bag for a ground-nut is Le 300,000.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the ground-nut business is a lucrative one, ground-nut dealers, like Isatu, some times encounter difficulties in running their businesses. They may discover rotten ground-nuts in the sealed bags, which could lead to a loss of profit. Again, they have to travel to villages like Bamoi to buy the ground-nuts and sometimes vehicles are difficult to find to transport the goods. Terrible weather can also hinder Isatu's ability to obtain her goods. Notwithstanding the difficulties she faces as a business woman, she believes in her business as it the only means through which she can survive.

She now lives alone, and because of this, she works very hard as a cook in a restaurant near her town. While her husband was alive, he worked on a small farm, where he cultivated pineapples, bananas, and coffee. Now his plants require fertilizer and other treatments, and Ana spends a little time on the weekends tending to them. From Monday to Friday, she works as a cook in a restaurant from 4 in the morning until 9 at night, using her culinary skills. She earns 250 soles thanks to the good flavor of her food. During the coffee harvest, her salary increases to 400 soles since she has more clients. Ana is happy with her job as a cook and with her agricultural work, but sometimes, when she sees the coffee harvest she gets nostalgic upon remembering her large family. She knows that it offered the best to her children and that now they are good people. With her priD. she hopes to continue forward because she knows that life provides many surprises. Ana, in spite of her work, sets asiD. some time to work as the president of her community bank. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she is very punctual in making her payments. The money that she is requesting will be used to buy fertilizers and the other part will be used to order cutting her coffee farm and to grow without difficulties. She wants to invest in her farm since it has been left to her and her husband and because her husband would have liked it. She is also thankful to the community bank because she has learned the responsibilities of repayments and it has given her the opportunity to continue working. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":272028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":170}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423763},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117075},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011988},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595573},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989835},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210971},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640474},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080118},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":170.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996405},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":170.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841938}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T17:22:58Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":93346,"name":"Zaher","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaher is a 23-year-old man who lives in Saida, souther Lebanon.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sum"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To purchase medicine to sell to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613696},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010775},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233061},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664852},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105564}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T02:44:14Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Waring","image":null}},{"id":105634,"name":"Teofila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teofila es socia del Banco Comunal Golondrinas.\nTeofila es casada, tiene 45 a\u00f1os y 7 hijos, Teofila tiene una tienda en su casa en donD. venD. abarrotes en general, verduras, carnes, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda D. su esposo.

Their father doesn\u2019t live with the family but he sends money from his work on a boat.  Thanks to Dora\u2019s efforts from her work as a nurse in a clinic, she is also able to provide income.  Dora lives in her own house. She  sells food retail which she buys wholesale, and delivers in the area to customers who pay on credit in two payments.                   She also purchases seasonal products: she is currently buying Christmas items.  The competition is normal, but she has acquired a lot of experience and developed her abilities and skills in the business.  This has helped her a lot and now she is very popular with her customers.  With the loan that she received from the institution, Dora is putting capital into the business since the season is short- being close to the end of the year.  And she is paying a balance to agrocapital.  Dora\u2019s history of payments is good and her average of late days is zero.

She has two daughters, 19 and 13 years old.  They are her biggest motivation.  With love, dedication, and constant work she, by herself, has gotten them ahead with her seamstress business.  \r\n\r\nWhen she started this activity she did it as a pastime.  But, upon separating from her husband, necessity obligated her to make it more than a passtime.  She started looking for a market in the different schools in Cartagena.  Her effort and the quality of her products helped her get contracts with different educational entities, neighbors, and business employees in the city.  She currently sells a diverse line of clothes to them.  They ask for complete outfits, uniforms, blouses, pants, and elegant designs.\r\n\r\nMarisol thanks God for the marvelous gift that she has to do this work.  Her creativity is evident in each design; she adds lots of love.  She started making clothes in 2006.  This work gives her the opportunity of covering her children\u2019s necessities; food, education, clothes, and entertainment.  In addition to covering the family costs, she has been able to buy everything she needs in the house for a better life.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan that she has received from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  With the previous loan she bought raw material and increased her customers.  She accessed new domestic markets and institutions, and she has contracts with them.  Her business has definitely changed her life.  With the business she has work, great personal satisfaction, and she is able to give her children a better standard of living.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a loan for 2,000,000 COP.  She will buy raw material and supplies to make uniforms for everyday and for physical education for the school that she has contracts with and for orders from different customers that she has in the neighborhoods in the city.\r\n\r\nMarisol\u2019s dream is to see her business gradually grow.  Later, she would buy industrial machines and have workers operate them, which would generate income for their families.  She would offer her services to a lot of people who do not know her products and be recognized in the city.  In the long term she would expand into different cities in the country and represent Colombia.  Another one of her goals is to see her children become professionals because she considers that to be the best legacy that she can give them.  She also dreams of having her own house.  The biggest difficulty that she has is facing life alone with her two children.  But, she thanks God that she was able to get ahead.  Now she is happy and fulfilled knowing that she has given them everything they need and taught them that life is not easy.  But, with effort, dedication, and much love they can achieve all of their goals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is 39 years old. Evangeline is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Evangeline B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nEvangeline is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she raises pigs to sell. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $115 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Evangeline joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 5th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maria Erma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $95, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her future and her plan of buying a multicab. Maria Erma C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

With the 3000 soles he will buy corrugated iron to put a roof on his new home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":968509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy corrugated iron to put a roof on his home\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-01T23:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":199.85},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":224.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":226.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":237.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":240.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":255.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":261.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":281.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":290.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":301.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.93},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.53},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1516.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246219},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1516.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975900}],"funded_date":"2012-01-12T23:23:34Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":381052,"name":"Madre De Familia 1, 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Berthe is a Haitian citizen.

Most of her previous loans had been invested in breeding cattle but the profit was not as high as she expected.  Therefore, recently she has borrowed more money to open a small store selling salt.  Every morning, her husband would purchase salt from the seaside and she would resell it to other stores and customers in the area, earning roughly 3 million VND monthly.  Apart from this business, her family is still raising cattle and work on the field (but less than before).  Due to a stable source of income, she has been able to repay all the loans on time and still able to pay for her children education and living expenses.  Currently, the price of salt is low so she would like to borrow money to buy more and put in reserve to sell later.  This cycle she would like to borrow 6 million VND.  Her family income monthly is about 3.5 million VND.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh H.

When Julia first opened her store she did not have many patrons because she was still unknown, but since then the customers have increased. Since joining FINCA Per\u00fa she has been participating in training programs that help her improve her business. With the loan she is requesting, Julia will invest in her business by purchasing more products for her store and for her restaurant. She is saving for her dream of owning a car and helping her children continue their studies and becoming professionals. \r\n<p>\r\nAida R.

FINCA Per\u00fa, which Aida recently joined, has helped her improve her business. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy more products for her store. FINCA Per\u00fa emphasizes savings, and with her savings Aida dreams of her children continuing their education and being financially independent. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":211948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"The 19 members need different amounts of money, ranging from $35 to $200, totaling $2300.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-10-13T14:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dina Adrepina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tiburcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximeliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvestra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Humbertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nileda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rayda Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-27T19:16:29Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":383.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314826},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932443},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214738},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396468},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088279},{"amount":383.35,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981816}],"funded_date":"2008-10-13T19:16:29Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:08:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":72882,"name":"Qurbat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Qurbat K. is 45 years old.

Agnes M. from Mwanza is 45 years old and married with four children between the ages of 18 and 24. Agnes has been running a business selling charcoal since 2005. Charcoal is used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light it. \r\n<p>\r\nAs there is such a high demand across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative! Agnes works at the business for twelve hours per day, seven days a week, and is assisted by one employee. She currently earns about $150 USD from her business, and is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to purchase more charcoal and resell it. In the future, she plans to open another business. Agnes thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SELFINA<\/b><br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and lease-back microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

aspiration of Fe. She is married to Perfecto, who is a vendor and is 60 years old. She has five children to take good care of. She lives in Pililia, Rizal province, in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fe joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, hoping to have access to capital for her business operating a sari-sari store (general store). Since then, her business brings her enough proceeds for her family needs. It's her neighbors who are her avid customers.\r\n\r\nNow she seeks a loan of 10,000 pesos as additional capital for her store. The amount will be used to pay for sacks of sugar, beverages, cooking oil and groceries.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that with the support of ASHI and Kiva, little by little, she can reach her dreams in life: to send her children to school until college and to expand her business into a bigger grocery

She is 67 years old. Fabiana is widowed and has 5 grown-up children. To make a living, Fabiana runs a sari-sari or general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Fabiana has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fabiana joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fabiana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Fabiana is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Fabiana from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. She is now requesting a new loan of 14,995 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Conchita from PMPC.

It reaches to rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and the mother of four children. Previously, Mukaram's lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business as a traffic cop didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the home and of her children. This was the reason that Mukaram decided to start her own business four years ago selling the fabrics of the national dresses. Little by little she has made her business grow, and by allowing her clients to pay in installments she's seeing her orders get bigger. Now her business is running normally. However, she would like to continue bettering her household so that her situation will be stable in the future. She is asking for a loan of 3000 Somoni ($900) that she will pay back in four months. With this money, Mukaram will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for the national dresses and grow her business. The power to help her business grow is in your hands.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

Each member has already started their very own small business, and has started to experience some sort of success. \r\n<p>\r\nThis group is from an extremely poor area in San Pedro, Dominican Republic, and most have lived in this area their entire lives. Before receiving their first loans, each member was having a hard time providing for their families, let alone themselves. Hopefully this next loan will enable each member to increase the size of their small business, and to improve their standard of living.\r\n<p>\r\nDilcia G. is the representative of this group, and was more than happy to talk to us about her situation and life. Dilcia lives with her husband and her six young children (all under the age of 17). Each day has been a struggle for Dilcia and her husband to feed her six children, and also make sure they are getting to school. She knows that going to school and receiving an education is the only way for her children to break the cycle of poverty, and for that reason she does whatever she can to get them to school. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore receiving her first loan, Dilcia was not bringing in an income, and just relied on her husband's job. She felt useless, and felt that she was not an important piece of the family. Dilcia took out her first loan and started a small business making and selling food in her area. Since she is an excellent cook and a hard worker, her business did well and she was able to pay back all her loans and save some money. \r\n<p>\r\nNow she is going on her third loan, and hopes with this next loan she can expand her business even more. She said she finally feels like a contributer to the family, and feels like she is going to be able to provide her children with everything they could need! She is so happy about having her own small business, and is excited for the future for the first time in her life. \r\n<p>\r\nShe wants to thank everyone for the help they have provided her! Thanks for all your support and for enabling people like Dilcia to change their future!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":282998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They work with microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to meet the needs of their clientele and are on their second group loan, with the first repaid with no problems. They run diverse businesses, including selling children\u2019s clothes, charcoal, firewood, donuts, and soaps. With this new loan, they plan to buy a vanload of firewood, two dozen children\u2019s outfits, 60 bags of charcoal, 250 pieces of traditional soaps (farakourouni), 2 bags of 100 kg of millet, and about 20 kg of shea butter (for making donuts). They stock up at the big market in Sikasso and neighboring cities. The products are sold in different markets in Sikasso and in the neighborhoods to a clientele composed of men and women and mostly for cash. They foresee earning on average 17,500 CFA francs each per month of which a portion will be used to take care of the family (in the form of savings) and another portion will be invested in the businesses. The women of the Danaya group aspire to increase their sales in order to better satisfy their clientele.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":312293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy misc. items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Machitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":370,"local_amount":180000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":184839.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020241},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":92419.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242997},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":92419.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678778},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":92419.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112609}],"funded_date":"2009-06-02T03:10:27Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":109762,"name":"Eger Oswaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Eger Oswaldo M. tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, reside en el barrio Hialeah con dos hijos que su esposa dio, ambos j\u00f3venes estudian, el es cocinero de un restaurante desde hace tres a\u00f1os, anteriormente era mesero con su buen comportamiento lo ascendieron en la cocina.

She is 58 years old, married and has one child, who is 25 years old. Because of her strong determination to help her husband improve their living conditions, she saved their family from penury at a very critical point in it its past.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, Delia and her family lived a comfortable life. In addition to the stable salary that she and her husband earned from working at the biggest sugar mill in the island, Delia also owned and managed a restaurant that catered to and was patronized by the employees in the sugar mill. Then, because of many factors, including a sugar crisis and other economic downturns, the sugar mill closed down and let the majority of its employees go. Delia lost her business as a result.\r\n\r\nFortunately, severance pay from the company allowed Delia to start a small general store, from which she earned her daily income. With her hard work and diligence, Delia was able to recover from their financial downturn and in 2002, joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access additional capital. With help from this organization, her business continues to grow, and now earns a monthly profit which is a big help in defraying their household expenses.\r\n\r\nDelia has taken out and repaid a dozen loans from NWTF-PD. She plans to use this new loan to keep her general store well stocked at all times and continue to earn a good income for her family.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She has used them to add to her family income.  Thanks to her and her husband's earnings, the living conditions of her family have improved; they own their own home now.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to see that her sons finish their college education in Chemistry, Pharmacy and Medicine.

She\u2019s separated and lives with her daughter in her own home.  She has been a farmer for over 30 years.  She owns farmlands and also raises animals.  She goes out daily to take her sheep and cows to pasture.  Usually, her daughter helps her where animal and crop (potato and corn) sales are concerned.  However, it\u2019s the raising of animals that she stresses because this is where profits are higher.  This is why she intends to continue working to increase her herd size.\r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan with MFP and she assures that she will be very responsible with her repayments.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested funds to buy more animals in order to increase her herd size.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She is a very cheerful and hard-working woman.  She lives in her own house with her husband Walter, who is 52 years old, and her dear daughter Pamela, 16.  They are the reason for all her efforts.  Priscila grows peas, spinach and carrots for a living.   This she does with her husband who also works very hard to earn an income for their family.  For convenience sake she brings her products to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  It is here that she can obtain the best price.  What she likes most about her job is protecting her crops from the pests that can threaten her production.  She has been doing this for 30 years and considers transporting her products the most difficult since the trip is long and exhausting.  In time, she hopes to buy mO. land to increase her crop production and increase her income with the sales.  \r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  She is committed to making her payments on time since she does not want to cause problems for the other members of her communal bank where she is well-liked.

The communal bank members have many different businesses, such as knitting sweaters, making hats, selling clothing, running corner stores, selling Delicia brand products, and knitting skirts.\r\n\r\nPascuala has worked for Pro Mujer for two years and she joined the institution because she was invited to by a friend.  She currently has a handicrafts business knitting sweaters that she has been working at for five years.  She learned how to run this business at a training center.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is taking out now is to increase her working capital to buy wool that she will get at the Festival of La Paz on July 16 and that she will later sell on request.

She plans to travel in order to purchase an assortment of children\u2019s clothing for sale.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It is a pretty city with medieval architecture. It is the third most important city in Ecuador. It has a cold climate that is moderated by the warmth of its friendly and educated people\r\nMrs. Maria lives in a beautiful place in Cuenca. It is called Totoracocha. She is a member of the community bank called \u201cMujeres Triunfadoras\u201d (Triumphant Women). She is 48 years old and is happily married. The fruits of their love are the eight children they have created. They are 26, 25, 22, 21, 17, 15, 14 and 12. The oldest child is married and the three oldest children work and and help with the household expenses. The four youngest children attend school. Two of them go to night school and two of them go to high school in the afternoon. Her husband is incapacitated because he became ill from drinking too much alcohol. \r\nThis is her third cycle with the foundation. She is glad to be part of the bank because of all the benefits the foundation provides to her.\r\nWith the loan that the \u201cFoundation Espoir\u201d will deliver she will invest in her candy business. She has worked in this business for fifteen years and it has worked out well for her. She also has another job working in a cafeteria at night. She works everyday of the week without having a day off.\r\nThis is her third cycle working with the \u201cFoundation Espoir\u201d. She will use the money for her candy business to buy disposable items such as cups, spoons, sorbets, etc.\r\nHer dream is to have her own cafeteria because she has a lot of experience and she knows how to manage a business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva

Their eldest son is a full-time employee in Phnom Penh and the younger son attends school. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, Kunthea's business is suffering as his motorbike is old and does not work well. Thus, Sothery is requesting a loan of $1,000 to help her husband purchase a new motorbike to replace the old one and also to buy longan under contract for resale. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Sotheary T. and Mr. Kunthea Un are in the photo.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":441019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

C. is a widow who lives in Purok MMY Village, Bgry. Miranda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two businesses:  she sells fish and fattens pigs. Thelma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Thelma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 14000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4800, improving her family's standard of living.  This time, for her eleventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her fish vending business.  She will use the additional income to continue to save up for future home repairs. Thelma D. C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Nelio has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Nelio is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Nelio from HSPFI.

is Angie G., 42, resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Jaime G., a jail officer of the local penitentiary, and mother of three children, all of whom are still enrolled in elementary. By the grace of God, Angie has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Angie, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nAngie operates an Electronic Cellular Phone Loading Station. What she basically does is to buy electronic cellular phone load in huge amounts then retail it to the customer. Profit is generated depending on the network's policy of dealership. She may buy 3,000 PHP worth of load for 2,500 PHP, where she already has a 500 PHP profit, depending on promos and quota set by the networks. Angie is also currently readying a few pigs for slaughter and operating a buy-and-sell business with a variety of products.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products to be incorporated into her buy-and-sell inventory. She will also invest some of the loan to buy electronic load from different local networks. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nAngie hopes to be able to give her all her children a good quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

","en":"Munira is a loving wife and caring mother of four children. She started selling children's and women's clothes twelve years ago, when her husband did not have work. She travelled into the city and brought small quantities of goods. Later, she received a loan from IMON International and used the money for her business, increasing turnover.

Beatrice is a 53-year-old married woman with four children. She runs a kuku, or poultry, business that she started last year. Although she is a new entrepreneur, she has been making a monthly profit of approximately $US140. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. \"Kuku\" means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\nBeatrice is requesting a loan of $US275 to increase the number of chicks in her business and to purchase additional feed. With the expected increased profits, Beatrice hopes to increase the scale of her business.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

Thanks to her industry and courage in facing those trials, she started up a variety store as one of her sources of income to cope up with the basic needs of her family.   \r\n\r\nOne of her greatest dreams is to send her children to school and have them finish their studies.  She also dreams of a stable business and even of having the working capital to become a wholesaler of rice and a retailer as well.  With these dreams she needs a capital of Php 10,000 for her next loan through ASHI.  Giving a chance to have a starting capital of Php 5,000 she aims to do her best to maintain her good performance in ASHI, since this is an opportunity, according to her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":231959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Building goes by season in Kenya, so Amina does not sell much during the rainy season, but is quite busy now during the dry season, as people are building homes and offices before the rains come.<P>\r\n\r\nAmina found that working on the council has not provided her with a high enough salary to support the 5 out of her 10 children who are still dependent on her. Her profits from the popsicle business go toward daily transport, meals, and daily costs, while the larger (but infrequent) sales of building materials provide money for school fees and larger purchases.<P>\r\n\r\nAmina has applied for a loan of approximately 375 USD in order to buy what will be her second freezer, flavor and sugar packets, food coloring, and ice cream powder, as well as building materials. Amina says that she is two years away from retirement from the council, but cannot leave her businesses until her children are older. She has 1 child in university, 2 in college, 1 in form 3, and 1 in standard 7. They all attend private schools and the fees are high. Amina would like to expand from selling building materials into building houses with those materials and selling them. She is currently working to save funds in order to advance with this plan.

Due to financial difficulties, his studies were interrupted at the end of high-school. At age 20 Osvaldo moved from the Matola to the Boane district, where he still lives. He has been working as a driver-mechanic for 7 years. Working Mon-Fri, from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, his monthly salary is 8000,00 mt, which allows him to save some money--he currently lives in a house lent by his uncle. This is his first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. He learned about Hluvuku though a friend, who is already a client. Osvaldo plans to pay his first loan back quickly, so he can apply for another one, to finish building his house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

She has a fixed amount she sells every week, but would like to have more products to sell so she can increase her margin of income.  For this reason, she needs a loan in order to buy merchandise at wholesale.  The small quantities she buys now are not enough to allow her to buy at wholesale, so she is paying higher prices for her goods.

She has a business where she engages in three economic activities:  a sewing workshop, a variety store, and a beauty salon.  Luz is separated from her husband and has custody of her children because their father left the country.  Therefore she must work with great effort in order to get ahead.  She learned how to sew and style hair, skills that enable her to make a living and fight vigorously to support her children.\r\n<p>\r\nSince first entering the solidarity group program, Luz has received eleven loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She now receives individual loans.  Her participation in the organization has made a difference in her life because she has received business and personal advice in addition to taking out loans.  At the moment, she is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 COP to purchase school supplies, stationery, lingerie, accessories for making first communion dresses, linens, and shoes.   \r\n<p>\r\nThroughout the year, she has contracts with schools in the city to rent out first communion dresses since she manufactures all kinds of clothing and sportswear.  Through this activity she gives poor people the opportunity to wear clothing for special occasions at a very low cost.

S. is 31 years old and lives with her husband and their 3 children, ages 1,3, and 7 years.  They live in the Las Nieves neighborhood, one of the most traditional and heavily populated areas in the southeast part of Barranquilla.  They live in her parent's home, where they also have their business.  On her side, in a heated glass display case, she sells food and fried food such as soups, cold cuts, sausages, pork rinds, and rennet on a weekly basis, and on a daily basis she sells sweets and fruits, including sweets made of chocolate, marshmallow, coconut, and fruits such as mango, corozo, pears, and papaya.  On the other side her husband works selling fish, shrimp and other seafood.  This is their second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n and they request an amount of 2,000,000 Colombian pesos that they want to invest in the purchase of a light vehicle to transport passengers.  Her husband will drive this vehicle, and they will also use it to offer their food products for sale, because Yenni wants to have a daily income that is more reliable.  This is a medium that is often used for transportation over short distances and to other nearby neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nShe learned to sell watching her mother from the time she was a child.  Now she has this same business, which was left to Yenni 7 years ago.  Her previous loan was used to restock her store and to pay off other debts that were charging a high rate of interest.  Her dream and current challenge is to have her own house and to see her children grow and become educated for a better future.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Fernando B., a technician, and is mother to a young working adult and a simple stay-at-home who manages the household while she attends to her business.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a photocopying business. There is more need now than before for services like these as customers\u2019 demands increase. Her main patrons are students, who require her services for school requirements. She also has people who need her photocopier for documents, form replication and other similar needs. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy a second hand Xerox machine, bond paper, toners, ink, and other supplies for her business. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy spare parts and repair fees for the photocopying machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nTeresita dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He is married and is responsible for four people consisting of his wife and three children. Very dynamic, serious and entrepreneurial, he is proposing to expand his herd and repair his enclosure, so as to meet the needs of a rather large clientele from his village and its neighborhood, who buy animals from within 20 km of his village. With this goal in mind, Abduvahob is requesting a loan that will serve him as business capital. The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and also make some investments.   \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
