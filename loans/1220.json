Ella se dedica a la venta de tortillas y su compa\u00f1ero de vida, trabaja como jornalero en la comunidad y por las tardes y ratos  libres  recolecta la le\u00f1a que ocupara la cliente para la tortilleria; ya que elabora las tortillas en una cocina de le\u00f1a (hornilla), ella no estudio en su ni\u00f1ez y adolescencia. Pero, actualmente se a inscrito en un curso de alfabetizaci\u00f3n en su comunidad y manifiesta que ya esta aprendiendo a leer y escribir. \n\nEl negocio de la cliente consiste en la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de tortillas que vende con sus vecinos y algunos empleados que trabajan en una planta de destazo de pollos,corral y granjas avicolas.\n\nElla compra de la ganancia de la venta del d\u00eda 30 lb de ma\u00edz, para preparar la venta del pr\u00f3ximo d\u00eda. Se levanta a las 4:30 a.m. enciende la hornilla de le\u00f1a y pone a cocer el ma\u00edz, mientras prepara el desayuno de su esposo para que se vaya a trabajar. Luego, saca agua de un pozo artesanal para lavar el ma\u00edz y mandar al molino de nixtamal, a las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana todos los d\u00edas y empieza a moler. Prepara las tortillas desde muy temprano, su hija le ayuda con los oficios de la casa y se encarga de entregar las tortillas a  domicilio a algunos clientes esto lo hace hasta el medio d\u00eda.

La idea de hacer esto es para tener materia prima para la venta de tortillas y no comprar el ma\u00edz que muchas veces es escaso y caro en la comunidad. \n\n\n","en":"Elsys is 32 years old, in a relationship, and has a 14 year old daughter. She lives together with her daughter and life partner in her humble bahareque house. She is dedicated to selling tortillas and her partner works as a laborer in the community and at night spends his free time collecting firewood for the tortilla factory. Elsys makes the tortillas on a wood stove (burner). She did not study in her childhood or adolescence, but she took a literacy course in her community and shares that she is learning to read and write.\n\nThe business consists of preparing and selling tortillas. She sells them to her neighbors and some employees that work at a poultry farm.\n\nShe buys 30 lbs of corn from the earnings of one day to prepare for the next day. She wakes up at 4:30 am lighting the stove and begins to cook the corn, all while preparing the breakfast for her partner so that he can go to work. Later, she collects water from a well to wash the corn, and at 6 am every day, she begins to grind the corn. She prepares the tortillas very early. Her daughter helps her with household chores and is responsible for delivering tortillas to the homes of some clients around noon. Then, her daughter walks to school in the afternoon, and Elsys prepares to go to her literacy class at 2 pm that is taught by a neighbor of hers.\n\nThe loan that she is seeking from Fundacion Campo is to buy herbicides, pesticides to cure the seeds at the moment they are planted, 3 sacks of fertilizer, and to pay laborers for some days of work to prepare the terrain and to plant on a hillside, which does not require much tilling.  If there is a consistent rainy season they will harvest the crop and transport the grain to their house where they store it.  \n\nThey grow 7,000 square meters of corn on the property of one of her relatives. The idea is to grow the raw materials for the tortilla business because it is very expensive to buy them in the community.

He is a father of six children. He has been in rice farming for the past 20 years. With the loan, he would like to buy more fertilizers for use in rice production. The profits from the rice farming will be used to buy a house for his residence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

infant grandchild. Rusudan works as a saleswoman in a clothing store and gets a small monthly income. Her husband and son-in-law are construction workers and work on special orders. The existing funds are very small and hardly enough for covering expenses, so Rusudan decided to start a grocery store to increase the family income, but she needs financial support to implement her plan. Unfortunately, Rusudan lacks access to financial institutions to obtain credit to start a business, as they require a stable income and business experience. She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo--the start-up program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of USD 1,900, Rusudan will purchase basic groceries to set up a grocery store. She will take care of her clients and treat them in a kind and friendly way. Her daughters will assist her running the business. With this credit, she expects to improve her income and increase the turnover gradually. Rusudan will work hard to tackle her financial difficulties and make her repayments on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1426069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

To achieve his goal, Mauricio has enrolled in the Universidad Mayor De San Simon. He plans on graduating in June, 2014 but without a loan from Vittana, he fears that he will need to defer his graduation. \n\nWith this loan, Mauricio plans on spending the money towards purchasing his textbooks. As an added expense, textbooks are often not bought to save money. With them Mauricio hopes to be able to better understand his subjects. In addition to his responsibilities at school, Mauricio currently works 30 hours a week and earns $9 a day.

the Brownsville, Texas, area.  \n\nEver since he could work, Patricio always worked for his father, transporting rock, dirt, concrete and other building materials to work sites where his father installs septic tanks. But this familiar business wasn\u2019t just a job to him; it provided a living.\n\nIn early 2013, Patricio\u2019s father helped him purchase a truck to help with the hauling. As his father saw the entrepreneurial spirit in his son, he passed the truck ownership to Patricio to form his own trucking and construction business.\n\nThe money Patricio saved from working with his father wasn\u2019t enough to maintain the truck, keep the tank full, properly operate his business and purchase what he needs before bidding on projects. \n\nSeeing his struggle, his sister, a current Accion Texas Inc. borrower, recommended that Patricio visit the nonprofit microlender to inquire about applying for a loan. After Patricio applied and received approval, he quickly used the money for start-up and fuel costs, and regular maintenance for his truck. The Accion loan allowed Patricio to further his trucking and construction business and be competitive in his field. He is also now able to compete for larger projects in the Rio Grande Valley area.\n\nAs Patricio continues to bid for local work, he\u2019s planning his next goal, which is to hire subcontractors to assist with the workload.\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1407382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay start-up and fuel costs, and provide regular maintenance for his truck.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Brownsville, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":604776,"name":"Cherilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cherilyn is 41 years old.

They all live in the village of Benzana in Segou region (the fourth administrative region of Mali) and know each other as neighbors and relatives as well as through their business activities in the village. They work as vendors selling condiments, firewood and charcoal. With the goal of bolstering their working capital, the group members have decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their second solidarity loan cycle. Mrs. Satou (the first women standing from left to right in the photo) plans to use her loan to buy five bags of onions, two baskets of tomatoes, a bag of garlic, and a large quantity of vegetable oil from her supplier in Segou. She sells for cash and on credit out of her home and on the street, to a customer base composed mainly of women. With this loan, Mrs. Satou hopes to achieve an average monthly revenue of 20,000 West African francs, which will be used to provide for some of her children\u2019s needs and build up her working capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1425219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy condiments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Benzana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batou              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8 Bamady ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fadima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8  Karim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djodo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":84959.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207737},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":84959.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972429},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84959.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624979},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":84959.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850987},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":84959.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740653},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84959.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220237}],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T12:14:35Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:25:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":604832,"name":"Gabriela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gabriela is 42 years old and married with three children.

She's married and the mother of two children. She lives with her husband in a large traditional extended family in Bougoula-Ville, the city center of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nShe's a trained tailor, but instead of practicing this profession, she became familiar with the buying and selling of fruits (mangoes, oranges, bananas, papayas, avocados, pineapples, etc) a few years ago.\r\n\r\nShe runs her business at the Grand Market in Sikasso, and as a traveling saleswoman. About two years ago, eager to better satisfy her ever-increasing clientele, she decided to join Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n\r\nAfter three personal loans that were repaid without problems, she's seeking her fourth loan in order to buy cartloads of various kinds of fruits and better meet an ever-increasing customer demand.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, she foresees turning an average monthly profit of XOF 100'000 (ca US$ 200) to be used to help cover the expenses of her family, and repay the loan. She will reinvest the remainder in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1425230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy cartloads of various kinds of fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T09:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T09:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asmahou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":31250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":32637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207738},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":32637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972430},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624980},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850988},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":32636.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740654},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T09:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":32637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220238},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-22T09:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":32637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045183},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":32637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263060}],"funded_date":"2013-09-12T17:54:30Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T20:37:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":604861,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alma is 44 years old and single.

On the other hand, she has plans to expand the business and set up a locale to sell food. This is her second Kiva loan and she is very happy to know she has financial support that will allow her to continue forward with her business. That is why she is committed to making the payments on time. The amount of 1000 nuevos soles she has asked for will be invested in fixing up the locale, such as by painting the walls. She is also going to buy sodas and snacks wholesale to sell and thus have more income. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1427286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to do maintenance on her locale and buy soda.

She lives with her uncle and one of his children in Bougoula-Ville, the downtown area of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nFatoumata has been in the business of purchasing and reselling spices for around 5 years in the big market of Sikasso where she has a stall.

The shop was built by her father and his friend three years back. She sells pan, tobacco nuts, tobacco leaves, cigarettes, local cigarettes, sachet shampoo, sweets, candies, detergent soap, detergent powder, etc. She says, village farmers usually stop at her shop to buy pan and cigarettes to take them to their field, and  while returning from the fields they stop again for pan and cigarettes. Agui shares that villagers love chewing pan and smoking cigarettes as it is affordable for all. \r\n\r\nShe wants a loan from Kiva to get more stock for her shop. The present income is insufficient to get abundant supplies as she also shares family financial problems. Therefore she is planning to get more supplies like bathing soap and more pan items like tobacco nuts and leaves. She has plans to expand her pan shop into a grocery shop in the future. The lack of a big grocery shop in the village creates lots of hassles for the villagers as they had to travel to the main town market for grocery items. She is happy that her plans will be fulfilled and thanks Kiva and WSDS for the support.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in running tea-stalls, selling chives, weaving and farming."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1422991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase supplies for her shop and expand the shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bishnupur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T13:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Achuiliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khangamlu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charinlu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Percy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jangamliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guangthuilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ajailiu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apanliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dihni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aguilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chamlangliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T08:18:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":604786,"name":"Rengsai Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In autumn, these ten hard working tribal women formed a group called Rengsai.

They hail from a remote tribal village that is 25 kms away from the city of Imphal in the northeastern region of India.

She is a mother to two children. Her husband is a private school teacher in the village. Being in a private school, he does not get a salary regularly and therefore could not meet the family's needs. Hence, in order to eradicate the worries of the family, Gailunei opened a variety shop in the village. \r\n\r\nShe keeps tobaccos, chips, soap, salt, candle sticks, matches and some daily essential products in her shop. Through the loan she avails from Kiva, she plans to expand the shop as well as store enough stock so that the shop will never run out of stock even during general strikes and economic blockades. \r\n\r\nShe also wishes to raise her two children by sending them to good school and providing them quality education. Her children are her source of inspiration. She appreciates WDSD\/Kiva for being gracious to her and the group.   \r\n\r\nThe rest of the women are engaged in weaving, ginger plantation and vegetable cultivation to generate more income.

It currently has over 3000 members, made up mostly of men and women who live in various regions of Senegal. The mission of this EIG is to allow its members to run their businesses in farming and fishing, general import and export, transportation, industry, handicrafts, construction, livestock, mining, fish transportation, hydrocarbons, art, culture, printing, carpentry, public utilities, performance, fish processing, agriculture, furniture sales, glass making, baking, and delivery service.\r\n\r\nThe group is led at the national level by Mrs. Ramatoulaye who signed an agreement with UIMCEC in order to finance its members, which would allow them to acquire the supplies and financing necessary to pursue their businesses.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh Groupe 46 is a borrowing subgroup of the EIG Makarimal Akhlakh, made up of both men and women, which has 10 members represented by Astou (the woman with her hand raised in the photo.) The borrowers are all members of the same EIG and run their own small businesses.\r\n\r\nAstou has been growing her business for more than 5 years by selling fabrics and vegetables. She begins each day at 8:30am and works until 6pm. The profits she earns from her business allow her to provide for her family and to pay for the schooling costs for her children. Astou is a member of one of the branches of UIMCEC where she is requesting a loan in order to purchase fabrics and vegetables for her business. \r\n\r\nAstou's hope is to meet the growing demands of her customers. With the growth of her profits through this financing, she plans to save money and diversify the products that she sells in order to better provide for her children's schooling.

Her family is made up of her three children and her partner. She finished four years of school. Her partner is a farmer, and she is both a farmer and a homemaker. Her parents taught her how to work the land from a very young age. Antonia has worked growing coffee and malanga [a starchy tuberous plant] for more than twelve years. Her customers are neighbors, family members and different coffee buyers that come to the area. Antonia owns the land that she farms, thanks to a bank that gave her the opportunity to buy it.

She also installed a photostat machine to generate extra income. The shop generates good income, as there are very few in town who run a photostat shop or own a printer. The irregular power supply in the town also gives an advantage to her shop, as she uses an external power generator to run the shop. She also sells eatables in the shop. The meagre income generated by her husband from farming is insufficient and, therefore, she also bears most of the household expenses for the family. During off-season, her husband usually helps her in the shop by getting all required items, such as petrol and printing papers, from the main market.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, she will purchase good quality ink cartridges and get the Xerox machine serviced for better results. She says maintenance of the machine is difficult when other priorities, such as kids' education, need to be a focus. This loan will be used for servicing the machine and purchasing ink cartridges.

Hard-working Hellut sells bathing soap, detergent soap, detergent powder, tobacco leaves, tobacco nuts, sweets, candies, chips, small-sized packet juice, etc. Her main source of income is the shop, so she gives her heart and soul to make this a successful business for her. She generally gets the supplies from the main market and sells them in the village at a little higher rate. Passengers waiting at the parking lot buy from her shop as it is easily accessible and that is again profitable for her business. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more supplies for the shop and could sell them during strikes and bandhs (protests). She says the place where they live is prone to curfews and economic blockades wherein supplies to sell are short. She is happy that Kiva could be of help in this situation and make her believe in herself once more.

She and the other nine members joined hands and formed the group to support and enable themselves to sustain and generate incomes for their family. They live in a village 40 kms away from the town of Manipur, which is also one of the northeastern states in India.\r\n\r\n Since Nengneilhing's husband serves as clergyman in the church on a voluntary basis, income generated for the family is not sufficient at all. Nengneilhing runs a grocery shop in the village. The shop is located in front of the village school, which is also the main pathway for the villagers. She sells all essential commodities like cereals, rice, edible oils, sweets and candies. Most of the buyers are village farmers, and their usual time to shop is during morning and evening. At day time, she is least busy, so she also sews and makes an extra income. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase stocks for the shop. Most of her customers rely on the shop as they purchase the supplies on credit and usually pay it back at the end of the month. She said that she will expand the shop once she avails the loan and will repay the loan on time. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for lessening her burden and building a relationship with them. She says, \"Thank you so much.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members are engaged in piggery, paan-dukan and ginger farming.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1425173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase and refill the shop with more grocery items and makes more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kholneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengtinlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jangkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veikholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjalam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T18:34:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":604913,"name":"Bawi Lestari 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After fulfilling its obligations to Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK), Ni Nyoman and the members of Bawi Lestari 2 Group get another loan.

She is engaged in a tailoring business and the town also acknowledges her work. Total dependence on her husband's income would surely bring them a huge debt with children's education fees and other expenses. She shares the family expenses by generating extra income from tailoring mosquito nets. \r\n\r\nManaging family expenses and efficiently running the business is not easy with little profits. Demand is high but sometimes she fails to supply because she can't afford the capital expenditure to purchase a the whole roll of the cloth to make the nets. Customers usually bring the cloth material to stitch when she can't provide it. Then she gets paid only for the labour she spends on tailoring. This is the biggest drawback in her business and she is determined to overcome this issue.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase cloth material in bulk and sew the nets. All the generated income will be accounted as hers. That way, she has more opportunities to expand her business.

When she isn\u2019t being a teacher in the school, she is a farmer, something she learned at a very young age from her parents. Her parents were farmers all their lives. The farm she works was passed on to her from her parents so that she could earn more profits and to give her a better lifestyle and a good education. This year is her first harvest; she has worked for over two years preparing the soil and giving the field the best care possible. Once it was sown, she anxiously waited to see the fruits of her labors.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, today she is asking for financing with which she hopes to give the final touch to her crops so that they will be profitable. She will buy 12 quintals of fertilizers, 10 quintals of coffee formula and 12 quintals of urea to give maintenance and help to her coffee crop because she hopes that her harvest will improve and have excellent results.\r\n\r\nHer goals for the future are to increase her lands, to sow a variety of grains to help grow her business, to improve her profits for her daughter, and most of all to earn a good income in order to give her a good education and to send her to the university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1428012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T16:50:04Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Keila Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":14500.08,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T09:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":14527.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535659},{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":14499.92,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":14527.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542499105}],"funded_date":"2013-09-24T18:37:25Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":604955,"name":"Carmelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelita is 55 years old and married, with five children.\r\n\r\nCarmelita works hard to provide for her family.

Some of his children are studying at the university and some are still in high school.  For more than 15 years, Hait had worked as an electrician at a factory.  Since his salary was low, he left that job and started his own business as an electrician.  Hait has always dreamed that his children would obtain a university education.  This year, his 17 year old son, Nazir, has finished high school and enrolled into the Khujand State University.  Hait is asking for a loan to pay for his son's university tuition.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has a high school education and provides the main source of income for her family. She raises livestock, which she began 15 years ago when she bought cattle for 10,000 som. Thanks to her hard work, Nazira now earns 10,000 som per month and has thirty sheep, one milk cow, and one heifer. In order to expand her farm, Nazira asked Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 som to purchase cattle for breeding.

She is married to Jaime, an employee, and she is a mother to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household, while operating a business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarietta runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out,\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In this case, Marietta is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper, when compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, Marietta's business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in net sales, every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional stock of used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags, and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan back into the business, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nMarietta dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her family is always in good condition. She meets up with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1426987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

after the death of her husband and also running her own business.  Kanymbu has a secondary education. She works at a local school cafeteria.  To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 24 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 2,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Kanymbu's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 calf, 15 sheep and 14 goats.  The monthly income amounts to 6,500 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Kanymbu requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to increase livestock headcount by buying sheep.

Their son is married.  Gulfara has a secondary education.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 18 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Gulfara's hard work, today her business contains 3 horses, 12 sheep and also 3.92 hectares of land, where she annually grows beans and potatoes.  The monthly income amounts to 8,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Gulfara requested a loan in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to gather her harvest.  Gulfara plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and plans to save money to continue educating her grandson.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1424918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Elfete owns cows to provide for her family's needs, which allows her to be able to save the money that she would normally spend on milk and other dairy products.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, she is requesting a loan in order to buy another cow and to renovate her stable since it has been a long time since she was last able to fix it. The loan will help them to improve their living conditions, because increasing the number of cows and taking care of their surroundings will enable her family to have more milk and milk products.

He remembers that his father bought him a machete to take him along and teach him how to weed the cornfield; he\u2019d get up at dawn and work all day.  He didn\u2019t get the opportunity to attend school until the age of 14 when he was sent to school.  He learned to read and write and completed first grade.\r\n\r\nLater when he decided to form his own family he\u2019s worked growing basic grains and ten years ago decided to buy a gravid cow to gradually increase the number of animals and he\u2019s managed to develop to subsist and cover other needs.  Today, he\u2019s taught his children to farm so that in future they will be able to develop work skills and develop other skills.\r\n\r\nThe client works raising calves; he buys them small and sells them already pregnant.  He\u2019s been doing this work for about 10 years now.  In addition to this, he works growing corn and sorghum from which he gets crop discards that serve as animal feed during the dry season.  His two children help him with the agricultural chores and to care for the animals.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy calves to raise during the next year; they will be destined to milk production or to sell pregnant and to yield profits to cover some of his family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nIn future, Margarito intends to keep the doors open to another loan once this one is paid off, if necessary.  He also intends to work exclusively raising calves (expand the business) and to let his children carry out the agricultural activities to cover the family\u2019s basic needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1411073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarito Obdulio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525579}],"funded_date":"2013-10-12T00:39:15Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:13:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":604103,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha esta separada del esposo, vive con sus hijos en casa propia de la ciudad de La Paz.\n\nActualmente se dedica a la venta de fruta en la zona sur de la ciudad de La Paz, ambulando todos los dias vendiendo frutas de temporada las cuales las comercializa en diferentes lugares tanto en pensiones y snaks.Necesita credito para incrementar su capital de trabajo y poder comprar m\u00e1s fruta para ofrecerla a sus clientes \n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Martha  es tener una tienda de abarrotes en su casa\n","en":"Martha is separated from her husband and lives in La Paz.\n\nShe sells fruit in the southern part of the city, walking every day selling seasonal fruit in different places.

The region is very complicated in terms of land, and they do not have access to electricity even though the community has asked the local authorities for support.  Specifically, Bernardo's group depends on candles, and sometimes ocote (pine resin), for lighting.\n\nThis is Bernardo's story:\n\nBernardo is a 48-year-old man that lives in the community of Tlaxcantitla, described above.  He supports a family of 4 mainly by cultivating corn, and sometimes by selling firewood to the community.  Bernardo's house has no access to electricity, so the family relies on other lighting sources such as candles and ocote, which are not very powerful or efficient.\n \nFor this family, education is very important, and a solar home system will allow Bernardo's kids to increase the time they can use for academic activities at night. \n Additionally, Bernardo needs to be more productive to increase the family income, which now is about $25 USD on a productive week, and create a better life for himself and his family.  A solar home system will allow him to achieve this goal. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1428915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase a solar home system that will allow him to improve his productivity.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tlaxcantitla, Zongolica, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":275,"posted_date":"2013-09-12T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-12T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Merced","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":624.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410334522},{"amount":16.7,"local_amount":210,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":218.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419876117},{"amount":64.43,"local_amount":810,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":842.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430245981},{"amount":128.86,"local_amount":1620,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440007582},{"amount":42.95,"local_amount":540,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-04T09:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":561.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459122509},{"amount":175,"local_amount":2200,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-04T09:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2289.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467938480},{"amount":49.33,"local_amount":620,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":645.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490853541}],"funded_date":"2013-09-14T03:46:38Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T14:23:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":603783,"name":"Saltanat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442 23 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 2 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0421\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442 -

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEstrella Marie operates a doormat business. Her products are small rugs and larger doormats. She buys a large quantity of doormats and then sells them. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought; sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. She directly sells her products to her neighbors and the local community. \r\n\r\nShe also has a direct selling business for additional income. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of doormats. \r\n\r\nEstrella dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies. \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Blanca sells fish, so she goes out to the local market very early to look for fresh fish, which she takes back to her father-in-law's house. Because the house is in a busy area of town, she sets up the fish in front of the house and waits for customers to come to buy high-quality fresh fish. She has been doing this work for about a year and works on her own since her husband works in another region of Peru and sends money back home to support the household. She likes her work because it gives her time to be at home doing other things. It also offers her a good income, and she hopes to be able to support herself and perhaps in the future set up a grocery store in her house. This is her second loan with Kiva, and she is grateful for the opportunity it provides to increase her working capital and generate higher earnings. She will use the requested loan of 1000 soles to buy fresh fish, as well as some trays and other materials so she can sell more comfortably and not have to use items belonging to her husband's parents."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1428078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T00:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T00:30:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":148.05},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":160.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":159.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":172.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":175.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":184.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":148.05,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":155.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353803},{"amount":60.13,"local_amount":160.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":168.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905562},{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":159.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091550},{"amount":64.6,"local_amount":172.28,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":180.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778145},{"amount":65.74,"local_amount":175.29,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-09T10:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":183.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598552},{"amount":69.1,"local_amount":184.28,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":193.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147499}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T18:35:09Z","paid_date":"2014-08-02T10:00:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":605030,"name":"Desederia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Desederia is a hard-working entrepreneur who has a restaurant business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 40,000 through NWTF to buy additional ingredients like vegetables, spices, meat, fish, etc., for her restaurant.\r\n\r\nDesederia has been in this business for 28 years.

They have been together for ten years and have three children, two of which go to school. Jes\u00fas and Josefina have a family business selling auto accessories such as colored lights, stickers, deodorizers, steering wheels, side lights, carpets etc. Hilaria will invest her part in her grocery store.\r\n\r\nThis time Jes\u00fas and Josefina are requesting a loan to buy more products, things they do not have, like cables for installing alarm systems, Jes\u00fas told us: \"Before we had no idea how to install alarms, but now I am taking courses to learn and get my business ahead. The challenge for me is that I don't know how to manage the business. I started it because it was what my father used to do\". Jes\u00fas has been in the business just three years. \r\n\r\nThe goal for Jes\u00fas is to expand his business but also in the future he would like to open another business close to his house. The current location of his business is on loan to him. He has to pay rent each month and it is an obligation his family has to keep. He would like to take a course in managing his business. He is learning little by little through experience, but he would love to have more formal training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1127650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy automobile accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Lucas, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5763.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6101.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6392.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6742.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":469.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":519.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":443.83,"local_amount":5764.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5807.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227957},{"amount":469.87,"local_amount":6102.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6147.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991802},{"amount":492.22,"local_amount":6392.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6440.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644450},{"amount":519.08,"local_amount":6741.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6791.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877911}],"funded_date":"2013-09-15T04:29:44Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":604510,"name":"T\u00e9ko","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"T\u00e9ko pour subvenir aux besoins de la famille fabrique et vend des savons \u00e0 domicile.

Angelina, or Ange as they call her, is 44 years old, married for 27 years to Jorge. Together they have a family with four children, three of whom are still dependent upon them and two are still in school. Ange has had a flower shop for nine years and says that the idea was hers. She began it by renting a locale, selling only natural flowers and with time she decided to take a class in flower arranging. \"I enjoy seeing how flowers can be decorated and combined; if the flowers are very pretty by themselves, they are even more so as an arrangement.\" Ange's business is going very well and little by little her husband also is becoming more interested in this business so she has taught him everything she knows and now each of them has an independent flower shop. They aren't having any difficulties and their flower shops are successful in each of their seasons. They buy the flowers in another town where they get a cheaper price in order to increase a little more their profits. \"My only goal is to see my children become professionals; my spouse and I inspire each other to be able to pay all the expenses of the children's education.\"  The members of the group are Angeles, Blanca Estela, they are seeking a loan in order to invest in growing yearling sheep, Adriana wool and cosmetics, Emma sells tortillas, Kevin raises chickens, Milagros sells clothing, Carmen baby clothing, Emma R. steers and Norma rents furniture."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7050,"image":{"id":1423966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy flowers to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":7050,"lender_count":152,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Los Anageles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milagros Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":92000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":7050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":11500},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":11500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":881.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":881.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":881.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":881.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":881.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":881.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":881.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":881.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1762.5,"local_amount":23000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":23060.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227958},{"amount":2643.75,"local_amount":34500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":34591.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991803},{"amount":1762.5,"local_amount":23000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":23060.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644451},{"amount":881.25,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":11530.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877912}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T15:20:08Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":605044,"name":"Channang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Channang is single, lives with her parents, sister and brother on an Island in the Mekong River about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh City. \r\nChannang is a silk weaver.

The place where the members live is a large community where they grow corn even though the people of this place are sad because in recent days a frost fell and burnt many crops and they think it will be difficult to recuperate the product, even more so with the lack of rain. Celedonia, who they call Cili, is 48 years old, married to Francisco for 29 years and have a family with six children, of whom only one girl depends on them to attend school. Cili raises and fattens beef cattle, for 25 years, since she was very small. She watched how her mother also raised and fattened animals. when she married she saw the necessities her home needed and decided to help with the expenses. While her husband was working Cili took care of the children and she had a little bit of time left over. Raising beef was her best decision, Cili bought the animals when small and took care of them for a while to sell later. She says it was not difficult to raise them, it requires effort and a lot of work thus her only difficulty is the lack of money to buy them their feed. Also when the animals are sick and lose weight customers don't want to buy them in that condition. \"I continue raising the animals so that when I have an emergency I can sell them, even if they only pay me a little it doesn't matter, I wouldn't like to stop raising my little bulls.\" Cili dreams of continuing to support her husband with the household expenses and with the education of their daughter. \"If she wants to have a professional career, I am going to help her.\" Thus as Cili has grand dreams and great desire to see her daughter succeed, the other members of the group also have goals to accomplish and therefore they are seeking a loan with the institution to invest in their businesses and in this way obtain more income. Concepcion and Marian will invest in their convenience stores.  Maria L. will invest in clothing and Juana will invest in chickens and turkeys. All are very content as they began with a loan and promise the institution and Kiva to remain in good standing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1423972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy feed for calfs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Valerio San Jose del Rincon.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T03:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T03:10:01Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celedonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8259.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227959},{"amount":946.88,"local_amount":12375,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12389.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991804},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8259.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644452},{"amount":315.62,"local_amount":4125,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4129.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877913}],"funded_date":"2013-09-14T10:47:29Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":604516,"name":"Memenaka","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Afin d'augmenter son capital, Memenaka revendeuse de produits d'alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale fait sa toute premi\u00e8re demande de cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 WAGES.

Medina has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Medina works with livestock breeding, after having started 18 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Medina's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow, one bull and also 5.70 hectares of land. On this she plants beans and wheat every year.
