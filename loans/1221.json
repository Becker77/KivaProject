","en":"Lira is 43 years old, divorced, and has two children. Lira has a specialized high school education. She has very good reviews from her neighbors. They speak of her as a kind and hardworking woman. As the main source of income for the family, Lira has since 2008 been involved in trade of food products, having started this business with 20,000 som (KGS). She has her own shop where she sells food products. Thanks to her hard work, Lira was able to develop and grow her business. Her activities bring in about 15,000 som KGS per month, which is the basis for food and household expenses. Income from the business allowed Lira to expand her inventory. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her business, Lira turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 83,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of wholesale food products for resale. Income from the loan will help Lira to increase trade in the grocery store, and the resulting profit will help to raise and educate the children in good

The group is comprised of three micro-entrepreneurs from Dansoman-Accra, Ghana. \r\n\r\nLucy is single and has one child, who is 18 years old and a second-cycle student. \r\n\r\nLucy is very excited to be receiving her first loan from ID-Ghana, hopeful of repaying it successfully. She has had her business for around ten years. Her business consists of selling foodstuffs (cassavas, plantains, coco-yams, yams, etc.)\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Lucy will be able to buy more plantains, cassavas, coco-yams, and yams to sell to customers in Dansoman.

and lives in the countryside, which has good conditions for raising livestock and growing crops. Shuhrat is married and is raising three young children. He is engaged in livestock and crop cultivation, and has sufficient experience in livestock and agriculture. Mainly, he grows wheat, barley, corn, and onions. His wife helps in running the business. Previously, Shuhrat traveled to Russia for work. He remained there for 6-7 months and returned home in the autumn, but due to illness it is already the third year since he stopped going there. \r\n\r\nShuhrat has two hectares of conventionally irrigated land and two hectares of rain-fed land. Due to the remoteness of sources for irrigation water in the summertime, he experiences great difficulties. To reduce the cost of production, Shuhrat does not hire seasonal workers and does all the work by himself with his wife. \r\n\r\nOne of the problems for all the farmers in the region is the remoteness of sources of water for irrigation, which reduces the productivity of land. Shuhrat applied for a loan for drilling a well, which very much eases the problem with irrigation water and thus increases the yield of the land.

It\u2019s a very small group but they are noted for the unity among them.  They chose the group name precisely because they wanted it to be a united group but also because it\u2019s the name of the community they live in.\r\n\r\nManuela, 69, is a very hardworking woman.  She\u2019s been married to Miguel for many years.  He hasn\u2019t worked for several years and only takes care of the drinking water system now.  They have formed a family of nine children together some of which are attending secondary school.\r\n\r\nManuela works making grilled corn and popcorn to sell outside her house.  She relates that all she has to do is set up a small table and a tarp to start selling the corn.  She only sells weekends on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  She takes advantage of these days because that\u2019s when she sells the most;  she\u2019s been in business six years now.\r\n\r\nManuela says: \u201cPreviously I had no idea how this type of Mexican snack food was made.  The business belonged to my daughter but she had to leave it to go work in Mexico City.  But when I saw the large clientele she had I decided to continue with it myself.\u201d  Manuela is very grateful to Kiva and to VisionFund because when she started selling the corn and popcorn she could only sell 50 because her money didn\u2019t stretch any further than that to buy more.  However, she found out about the loans and that\u2019s how she decided to request one.  Little by little her sales have increased and now she sells 100.  She adds chicken legs to her corn and was able to accomplish this thanks to the support and to her great effort.\r\n\r\nShe comments: \u201cI have no difficulty and am very happy with my business because I don\u2019t have to make much of an effort to carry it out.  Also, because I\u2019m an older woman I could no longer find employment easily and by selling corn and popcorn I\u2019m able to insure my future.\u201d  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the corn and popcorn sales, Manuela also raises small animals like chickens, turkeys, ducks and piglets to sell.  Her dream is to be able to have a locale in which to sell her Mexican snacks because it isn\u2019t too safe to sell in the street any more.\r\n\r\nThe other group members also have great dreams and are requesting their loans to invest in their businesses to reach their goals.  Silvia, \u00c1ngela and Imelda will invest in their grocery stores, Josefa and Flora will invest in pigs and Juan will invest in turkeys.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1423863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Edemar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":386.36,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5053.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227961},{"amount":579.55,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":7580.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991806},{"amount":386.36,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5053.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644454},{"amount":347.73,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4548.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877915}],"funded_date":"2013-09-15T19:37:39Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":605168,"name":"Recho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Recho  is a 58-year-old farmer, and widowed.

She has a university education, and most of her family\u2019s income comes from raising livestock and growing crops, having started nearly 15 years ago with 10,000 KGS\u2019 worth of cattle.  Thanks to her determined efforts, her farm now has 5 dairy cows and 5 horses, as well as 2.55 hectares\u2019 worth of land for growing alfalfa and barley each year, and her monthly income has risen to 10,000 KGS.   \r\n\r\nTo develop her farm further, Elmira is requesting a loan of 100,000 KGS from the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners; she hopes to use the money to buy more cows and increase her herds.  She plans on using the additional income that the loan will allow her to continue to buy more cows, as well as to save money for her children\u2019s education. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1425177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kojoyar village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T19:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T19:50:01Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":604575,"name":"Azimjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0412 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0418\u0441\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u0412 \u0418\u0441\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0447\u043e\u043d. \u0415\u043c\u0443 34 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u043e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0447\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 -

The group is made up of three members who live in a Mazahua community, known for having a very beautiful surrounding of trees.  They meet in a place that can only be reached on foot.  The most celebrated festival is on June 25 where they celebrate Santa Ana.  Gilberto, who represents the group, tells us that his nickname is Beto.  He is 57 years old and was a teacher, but now he is retired and has been married to Aurelia for 33 years.  They formed a family with their children, of whom only one still lives with them.  He is their dependent and attends school.\r\n\r\nBeto is asking for a Kiva loan through Vision Fund in order to buy grocery goods to stock his store.  He says that he started it 15 years ago because there was only one road to get to the other side of town and there were many people on it, so he decided to set up his store.  \u201cI started by setting up a table an some boxes to show my products, however over time I saw a need to buy new shelves and refrigerators to be able to sell cold cuts and also some cold soft drinks.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter some time they closed the road and built a fence, which caused his sales to drop in Beto\u2019s store.  This is when he decided to buy another house in another part of the community, where his store is now located.  Beto\u2019s challenge is the competition, but this situation does not discourage him.  It\u2019s quite the opposite, so he is asking for a loan so he can buy more merchandise.  He feels that if he has a bit of everything in his store, he will attract more customers.

She started out sewing around 20 years ago.  She learned the business empirically and little by little she has perfected her knowledge and technique.  She currently works with third parties as she has contracts with some neighbors in the area.  She works Monday through Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. or according to the amount of work she has.  This is how she has been able to generate the income to provide the daily necessities to her household and to provide her children with an education.  She is an enterprising, active woman who is dedicated to her family and her work, which motivated her to ask for a loan to buy an overlock sewing machine.  It will increase her current capacity, facilitate her work, and improve her production time in filling orders with the best quality finished garments.  This will be reflected in an increase in contracts and an accompanying increase in income that will allow her to keep ensuring her family's wellbeing.  In this way, Marta wants to keep moving forward to achieve her dream of strengthening her business and making it more profitable so she can offer her children, and especially her older daughter, a better quality of life and a better education.

She lives in the Gurjaani district in the Kakheti Region with her husband, Soso, and her mother. Her mother is provided with a retirement pension. The family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard and a plot of land where peach trees are grown. They produce wine and sell it locally along with the harvested peaches. \r\n\r\nAs the income is seasonal and not enough for the family, Ketevan decided to start her own family business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe Startup program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Her application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 5,000 Gel. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Ketevan will open a metal and plastic workshop. Soso will work in the workshop and get orders to produce metal and plastic products, as he is experienced in this field. Ketevan hopes that the business will be profitable and they will be able to expand it in the future to improve their living

He lives in a rural setting, and he is a businessman who deals in bark-cloth trading. Bark cloth comes from a local tree and was used as clothes in the old days.\r\n\r\nTonny works seven days a week, and each day he works for twelve hours. He supplements his income with agriculture, where he grows coffee.\r\nTonny has been in this business since 1996 and he supplements his income with agriculture that he carries out in season.\r\n\r\nHe learned this business from experience he acquired from his family members.  Being an early school dropout, he was engaged in this activity at a tender age.\r\n\r\nHe is acquiring this loan to add in his business by purchasing more stocks of bark clothes.

Living conditions there are a bit difficult, due to the high crime rate, fewer bathrooms, filthy conditions, and overpopulation, but the most interesting part is that rooms are a bit cheaper, there are options for traveling, the town contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia, and food is less expensive.    \r\n\r\nCynthia is unmarried and she has two children, ages nine and ten. They are attending school and living at home. Cynthia was able to complete 9th grade before starting her business. \r\n\r\nFor the past five years, she has been busy running her shop where she sells drinks, like stout, beer, and soft drinks, among others. \r\n\r\nWith the loan proceeds, she will buy more drinks for her business.

Asya has a specialist high school education and raises animals and crops as her family's primary source of income, a business she began 14 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 15,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Asya's farm now contains two milking cows, two calves and five sheep, with monthly income at 10,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her farm, Asya has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase steers for fattening and then reselling at the market for a higher price. Asya plans to use income from the loan for further augmentation of the size of her herd.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1425216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase steers for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ananievo village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-13T21:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-13T21:30:08Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.76,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":830}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":622.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":30348.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942612},{"amount":622.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":30348.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053309},{"amount":825.24,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40464.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.76,"payment_id":529946833}],"funded_date":"2013-10-12T16:36:29Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":605719,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to hire workers to handle the clearing and pruning on his coffee farm.

Living conditions there are a bit difficult, due to the high rate of crime, fewer bathrooms, filthy conditions, and over-population. But the most interesting part is that rooms are a bit cheaper and there are options for traveling. Interestingly, the community contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia, which leads to lower prices for food. \r\n\r\nMargaret is single, with three children aged between 7 and 18, all of whom are in school and live at home. Over the past eight years, she has been operating a table selling crabs.

Her credit requests were rejected several times since she was unable to satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received a credit in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

He is 57 and has a wife and adult children. Islom is a farmer and he works a small plot of land. As with many villagers, his property includes two cows for his family's needs. In addition to his current work, Islom now wants to buy and sell big-horned cattle in order to improve his family's financial situation. His starting capital is $450.

It is composed of eight members and is led by a board of directors, where Manuela is the president. \r\n\r\nThe businesses carried out by the members of the communal bank are varied; among them are: selling athletic equipment, sewing jackets, selling fruit, buying and selling lambs, weaving blankets, a neighborhood store, making traditional blankets, and selling ropes. \r\n\r\nThe loan that they are taking out will benefit owners of small businesses like Manuela. She says that she joined Pro Mujer four years ago at the invitation of a promoter from the organization who came to visit her at her house. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she has a neighborhood store.

As seen in the photo, krupa and krupacha are cotton mats which Tajiks use in lieu of couches and chairs.  Gulnoz has been making these mats for 2 years, and as her business has grown, her mother has come to help her as well.  In tandem with her mat business, she also buys and sells towels and tablecloths.\r\n  \r\nGulnoz' husband has gone abroad seeking work and has been away for some time already; she works hard to provide her 5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son with food, clothing and all the necessities of daily life.

Klara has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Klara's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 10 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 14,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Klara requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a cow for increasing livestock headcount. Klara plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and to save money for her son's

","en":"Nazira is 43 years old, a widow, raising a son after the death of her husband and running her own business. Nazira has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 17 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 35,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nazira's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 2 calves, 8 horses and also 15 heads of small livestock. The monthly income amounts to 18,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Nazira requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to increase livestock headcount by buying cows. Nazira plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock

When she was a little girl her mother, who worked as a domestic employee in different houses, taught her how to work and she liked everything having to do with cooking.  When she grew up she got married and had two children, but her husband left her.  Then she had another relationship and another child, and together they started their own business, a store and coffee shop, which they ran for 12 years.  Her partner passed away but she was able to support the pain and continue on.  She worked for her children's well-being and was able to buy her own house.\r\n\r\nOver time she changed the store for a fast food business and, because of the success she had, decided to set up her own restaurant two years ago in her home.  Little by little she became well known for her good food and service.  The borrower is a persevering, hard-working woman who is dedicated to her family and her work.  That is why she is requesting a loan to renovate the restaurant's bathroom and to buy new tables and chairs.  This is so she can provide better service and comply with hygiene regulations and inspections.  She wants to make her business more attractive in order to attract more customers and increase sales and income.\r\n\r\nGilma dreams about expanding her business and offering employment opportunities.

She has been a farmer for many years and works the land with her husband. Her husband  also works as a bricklayer to being in more income for the home when he has the chance. With him, she has 5 children who all live under the same roof. Her oldest son is 18 and he graduated from secondary school but didn't continue with his studies because there isn't enough income in the home. The next oldest, a daughter, is 17 and she is in her last year of high school. The next oldest, a daughter, is 13 and only went to school up to the sixth grade. The fourth oldest, a daughter, is 10 and in the fourth grade of primary school, and the youngest, a daughter, is 7 and in second grade. She has worked the land for more than 15 years and her specialty is growing coffee as well as making plant nurseries in season. They grow corn and beans for their own consumption as well as to sell sometimes. They acquired the land little y little and started with a small parcel that was inherited from her parents. They were the ones who taught her to work the land. Today her property is approximately 1.05 hectares of cultivated land thanks to their hard work day to day. They sell their product to middlemen and their crops are grown around their house. This facilities getting a better result with the yield, involving all of the family members and avoiding the cost of hiring more workers.\r\n\r\nLucila's dream is for her children to be able to go to school and improve their quality of life, as well as to leave them a strongly established inheritance. That is why at this time she has asked for a loan to buy 3 quintals of urea, 3 quintals of 12--24-12 formula, and 3 quintals of 18-26-0 formula to help prepare her crops for harvest, which is growing near, and to have an excellent result.

She plans on graduating in November, 2013, but without a loan from Vittana she fears that she will need to defer her graduation. With a $729 loan, Patricia plans on using the loan to cover the cost of her graduation fees.

She wants to help her children in their studies. \r\n\r\nElsa began making cakes with her own capital, then she began to buy merchandise from Karla until the point where she started selling from her own catalogues. Now she would like to invest in this season's products. She continues to sell cheese and cakes, as well as diversifying her business by selling clothes from Nicaragua and other items from the catalogue.\r\n \r\nElsa receives income from the sale of different products. She sells cheese weekly and makes cakes to order. Her income has allowed her to cover the repayment of the loan she applied for, as well as purchasing goods which enabled her to increase her income and expand her portfolio for her clients. \r\n\r\nThanks to her previous loan that was sourced by Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, she has experienced an important development in her business: she now has a client base who buy goods from her monthly. Elsa would like to invest in more products from the catalogue, since her years of work have garnered her royalties which she could capitalise on to obtain better earnings this season. Her husband is a fisherman who spends long periods away from home, which is why her business has made her the breadwinner of the family. \r\n\r\nElsa has big projects she would like to develop, one of which is to make a space in her home where she could display vases and exhibit her products in the style of a bazaar. She would also like to acquire a vehicle in the future which would make the distribution and commercialisation of her products easier. Through her efforts she has acquired a computer so that her children have the tools they need to study. She would also like to learn how to use it for her business.

Celmy says that it is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible. Celmy plans on spending her loan to purchase her textbooks, which are often not bought to save money.

videos and advertisements. Recently, he decided to go into business for himself and created Reanimator Media, a media company out of his new residence, Houston, Texas. Originally from Los Angeles, Calif., Adam works with one of the top acting agencies, which he says allows him to network with more musicians, actors and people they know.  \r\n\r\nAt 25 years of age, Adam says he can\u2019t say exactly how many artists he\u2019s worked with throughout the entire span of his business, but he says he\u2019s worked with at least 20 bands within the past 12 months. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and recently decided to make it a full-time deal,\u201d he says. And since he is new to having a registered business, Adam had to learn how to obtain more capital. \r\n\r\nWhile doing an online search for lenders, he found nonprofit microlender, Accion Texas Inc. Once he applied and was approved, he was able to rent a studio, pay monthly fees and charge other bands for his services and facilities. Before the Accion loan, Adam was paying studio fees by the amount of time spent;, and the fees quickly added up. But his Accion venture will save the business money, which could be used on Adam\u2019s one full-time employee, or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nAdam\u2019s business, however, isn\u2019t just for musicians looking to record their latest album. Adam\u2019s skills allow him to manage sound and lighting equipment for live shows, and his networking skills allow him to always stay employed. He says since he\u2019s worked with many other artists, bands are learning the name Reanimator Media and are seeking him when they need to rent equipment.\r\n\r\nAdam has plans to market his business through a clothing line named Occeus Couture. Accompanying Occeus\u2019 owner, their main designer will travel from Florida to Houston to open a new store. And to promote their upcoming grand opening, Reanimator was hired to complete marketing projects. Adam says this will help both businesses. The campaign will try to show other companies that his business doesn\u2019t work solely with bands, but with major companies as well. To learn more, check out Reanimator Media\u2019s Facebook page for upcoming events and Adam\u2019s latest information: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/#!\/ReanimatorMedia\/. \r\n\u2003\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1427428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to rent a studio in order to charge bands for his services and facilities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Houston, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-09-14T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-14T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":605501,"name":"Juvita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juvita is 30 years old, and she is married.

She has been involved with someone since she was 15 years old. Coming from that relationship, she has six year old daughter who currently studies in the first grade in the community school, which is about 50 meters from where they live.\r\n\r\nHer partner works in construction and also agriculture. Her in-laws also live in the house where she lives with her daughter and partner. Thanks to her efforts and those of her partner, they have managed to build a home on the land of her in-laws.\r\n\r\nLeivi comes from a family of eight siblings (three brothers and five sisters); she is the last sibling in the family. She grew up farming. She studied until the seventh grade.\r\n\r\nShe works selling pupusas (a treat made from stuffed corn dough) and other traditional treats during the afternoons four times a week in the community where she lives. She learned this thanks to her older sister, who taught her the job. She decided to do this because she already had her own home and had to help her partner to get by. She also works raising pigs and poultry, which she grows and fattens so that she can then sell them. At this point she has three years of experience.\r\n\r\nShe buys the supplies for her pupusa sales in the closest city. She has to walk twenty minutes to get to the street where she catches a bus. The bus travels around 40 minutes to arrive and buy the supplies. She does this once a week.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is asking for is to buy three pigs, valued at $225.00. She needs the rest of the money to construct a snack shop in the community from wood and metal sheeting. She can sell traditional snacks and pupusas to her customers, because the neighborhood is in a high-traffic area near the community school.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will get a higher income, which will allow her to give her daughter a better quality of life. She will also contribute to the support of her home.\r\n\r\nShe plans to have a stronger business in the future, where she can offer her customers basic staples.

","en":"Zarina is 43 years old and married.  She, her husband, and children live in Vahdat, a city not far from the capital.  Her husband works as an administrative manager in the school their children attend.  Zarina had her own business until six years ago when circumstances forced her to close it.\r\n\r\nNow she has decided to restart her business, since her children have already grown up a bit and she can dedicate herself to her business.  To realize her goal, Zarina applied for a loan.  She already has her own shop.  With the loan funds and her own savings, Zarina wants to buy grocery items in order to open her store and start selling.  She plans on expanding her business in the future and open a second store.  She is very happy that she will again be independent.

She also would go with a machete to the hills to prepare the soil and sow the corn and bean crops.\r\n\r\nCurrently, with the help of her children she has sown 7,000 square meters of corn and 3,500 of beans. Every single day she has to keep watching and waiting for her crops.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for is to buy three pigs ($225.00) and poultry ($100.00); she will invest the rest in farming.

The father of her children left her 12 years ago, but she has been in a relationship for 3 years and her current partner is a farmer just like her. There are four people living in her house: her 18 year old son who works in agriculture, her 6 year old grandson who studies, and her and her life partner.   \r\n\r\nJosefina has been a farmer for 38 years, a job her father taught her how to do. She also has another source of income selling cakes and prepared fruit. Her workplace is four blocks from her home which she can walk to or sometimes go by cart. Her life partner is the person who helps her on the farm.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is applying for will be put towards the purchase of seeds, fertiliser, herbicides and workers to grow corn, beans and sorghum.

is a 42-year-old married woman and the mother of four children. \r\n\r\nFifteen years ago she decided to start a stitching school business at her home to meet her household expenditures.

She teaches and stitches, with the help of her students, for the people living around her house and uses the income to support her entire family. \r\n\r\nDue to lack of funds, however, she is unable to teach each of her students because she does not have more stitching machines for practice. She contacted BRAC Pakistan for a loan so that she could get an additional machine to help her students practice. It\u2019s her third year with BRAC Pakistan and she has shown good repayment behavior.

She was only able to study up to first grade and did not finish primary school because her family had various financial problems and they were poor.   Her husband didn\u2019t complete primary school either as he only studied until fifth grade.  They have two children.  Their eldest son is 32 and lives in another country and he helps them with expenses.  The younger son completed third grade but he didn\u2019t like school, so he decided to work the land like his parents. Their income is dependent on coffee cultivation, although they also have a small general store that generates additional family income.  The family engages in various activities such as cleaning, cutting, pruning, and applying fertilizer and manure, which helps them maintain their crops.  They own the land that they work.   They inherited some land from Maria\u2019s parents, and with the profits from the first coffee harvest, they bought another parcel.  Their crops are a fifteen minute drive from their home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s goal and purpose is to tend to her coffee crops and sow new coffee plants to expand her crops because her family is very dependent on this work.  With the income from the production, she plans to make a terrace in the back of her house so that once the beans are cut and washed, she will have a space in which to dry them.  For this reason, today she has requested a loan from the Comixmul cooperative, with which she will purchase 3 quintals of urea, 6000 units of coffee plants, 3 quintals of 12-24-12 formula, and 3 quintals of 18-24-0 formula [types of fertilizers].  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1429589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase new coffee plants, and purchase inputs to maintain the planted crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-14T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-14T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Aida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1425,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":29084.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895327}],"funded_date":"2013-09-15T03:13:06Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":605572,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nancy lives in the Likoni area in Kenya.

She has a good business site with regular customers who buy from her, and she also sells good quality products. With this business activity, the community will eat plenty of vegetables at cheaper prices, which will lead to good health.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this business, she will pay her children's school fees and provide them with other school necessities; expand her business by reinvesting the profit, and also pay her bills.
