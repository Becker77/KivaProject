Daniela is 19 years old, married and has a young daughter who is not yet in school. Daniela explains that she went to school until secondary school, and when she grew up it was difficult for her to find a well-paid job where she could also have days off. So she decided she should open a laundry service, which she established out of her parents' house since she could set up a room for it there. \r\n\r\nWith her own business, Daniela was able to keep an eye on her house and her family. She says that she started this type of business because she once worked in a laundry and she saw that, though it was a difficult job, it was profitable. She is now requesting a loan, and says that it was her sister who invited her to join her group, Poetas, in order to ask for it, as she saw that Daniela was having some problems with her washing and drying machines. Daniela says, \"At the moment I am having a lot of problems with turning in the laundry on time, since it takes me a bit longer because two dryers and a washer have broken down, and I need capital to be able to fix them, so I can finish my pending work and not let my clients down.\"\r\n\r\nShe will also invest in products for washing clothes. She says her dream is to be able to buy three washer-dryer combos-- new ones, as the ones she has, she bought used. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Rodrigo, Irma, Ricarda, Teresa, Eduardo, Beatriz, Elizabeth, Pablo, and Roberto. They will invest their part of the loan in their businesses of buying car parts and oils, running a hair salon, buying and selling frozen foods, buying material and liquids for a unisex beauty salon, buying supplies to make traditional corn-based Mexican dishes, buying sweets and fried foods to sell, stocking seasonal fruits and vegetables and stocking clothes and shoes to sell by catalog."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7300,"image":{"id":1423178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to maintain washers and dryers and to buy laundry supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-14T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-14T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":7300,"lender_count":189,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodrigo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":7300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5937.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1825,"local_amount":23750,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":23830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227968},{"amount":2281.25,"local_amount":29687.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":29787.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991813},{"amount":1368.75,"local_amount":17812.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":17872.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644461},{"amount":1825,"local_amount":23750,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":23830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877921}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T02:30:52Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Meravi","image":1279777}},{"id":605587,"name":"Kumomoru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kumomoru is 35 years old, married to Eunice and a father of four.

She is 25 years old and married with two children. She started her business from a small amount of savings that she had made. She knew about Milango through friends, and she decided to join so that she could access credit to fund her business.

He is employed by a private company, making deliveries. He gets a small salary (approximately USD 240 per month). Mamuka\u2019s wife is involved in a cosmetics-trading business from her house. Her regular customers are women from the local community. The income from this activity is unstable and small, as well. The couple works hard, but their earnings are not enough to cover food and daily expenses. \r\n\r\nMamuka owns a flat in the city center, which is not renovated.

She started this business by selling to her friends, which led to her establishing her own business, and she learned these ways of selling from her friends. She is very happy with her business because she makes a lot of profits and it keeps her busy. Most interestingly, she learned different kinds of local languages. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy more fufu and soap to increase her business.

Today, thanks to their teaching, he has corn and bean crops, located on rented land.  He sells the products he harvests at the market, making this his main source of income, which allows him to support his family.  The borrower is an active, vigorous, enterprising gentleman and strives daily to ensure the welfare of his wife and children because they are his main reason for forging ahead, and overcoming various obstacles as his business is very unstable and uncertain.  This leads him to seek the support of a loan, which he will invest in the purchase of farming inputs (seeds, manure, irrigation, and fertilizers) that he needs in order to be able to harvest the current crop, prepare the land for planting again, and continue with his work.  Francisco dreams of growing his crops and making his business more profitable so that he can offer his family better living conditions and enjoy the fruits of his arduous labor.

She plans on graduating in December, 2013, but without a loan from Vittana, she thinks that she may need to take time off to work and save until she can return to school. Often there are fees for earning your title in medicine before graduating. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her responsibilities at school, Noemy currently works 40 hours a week as a medical assistant and earns $11 a day. Unfortunately, Noemy's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, her parents never had the chance to move up. \r\n\r\nGrowing up, finances have always been tight. As the youngest of five, with two older siblings attending college already, Noemy is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her own without the assistance of a Vittana

She is contributing much to the family income, as her husband\u2019s income is not sufficient to support their entire family. Bushra is a motivated mother of six and is responsible to provide them with good quality food, education and clothing. For the improvement of her business, she contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of 30,000 PKR. The amount will be used to purchase spools of threads, rubber bladders and leather covers in a large quantity to cater to more customers without delay. She is hopeful to get an increase in her sales, which ultimately will help in generating more cash. She dreams of expanding her business and desires to use part of the profits on her children\u2019s

She milks the cows every day and produces dairy products for sale. They also have a hectare of agricultural land, where they have 250 nut trees and 300 mandarin trees. They sell the harvested products at a good price. Because their income is seasonal and not enough for the family, Mtvarisa has decided to start her own business. She has sought credit from local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. This startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people and inexperienced entreprenneurs to get a loan for starting or re-starting a businesses. Her application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $1,200 to start a clothing business. She plans to purchase clothing at wholesale prices and then resell it at higher retail prices. This will increase her income and allow her to improve the living conditions of her

She is very appreciative of the trust she has received to get access to a loan.\r\n\r\nEpifania is a member of a group called Caracol and the other members of the group are:\r\nBenita, who sells sweets,\r\nMari Cruz, who sells snacks,\r\nRosa, who sells soft drinks,\r\nLucia, who sells fish,\r\nYadira, who sells clothes,\r\nEmma, who sells groceries.\r\n\r\nCelestina and Edith wanted to be part of this photo because they were part of a previous loan cycle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":1423978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts and maintain her vehicles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Cosolapa Caracol, San Miguel Soyaltepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T02:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T02:20:06Z","loan_amount":3700,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mari Cruz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yadira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":12078.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227970},{"amount":1156.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":15097.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991815},{"amount":925,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":12078.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644463},{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":9058.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877923}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T02:00:56Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aesclinn Donohue","image":1310197}},{"id":605673,"name":"Rael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rael is 32 years old, married to David, and blessed with 2 children aged 2.5 years and 3 months old.

So, she decided to start a husbandry business but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from borrowers. Her credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo - Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of $3700, Nana will purchase a milking cow and a pig. She will also purchase building materials and build a cattle shed.

Not long ago, a friend of Komil's suggested he work with him as a cameraman, as their client base has increased, and he wants Komil to take on some of the clients.  Komil worked as a cameraman some time ago, and has 10 years of experience as one.  He would film weddings, birthdays, banquets, and the like, and would always produce beautiful, high-quality work. \r\n\r\nTo get the ball rolling with his re-entry into the business, Komil is requesting a loan so he can buy a modern, professional-quality camera.  He has big plans for the future; for one, he plans on founding his own film studio.

The group is composed of eight members who will gratefully receive micro-loans for their productive activities.\r\n\r\nJuliana is a 40-year-old married woman with six children who range from eight to twenty years of age. Each one of them attends school and the oldest daughter is in college. Juliana is thrilled with their educational progress. Juliana works in the textile industry and manufactures beautiful, traditional Guatemalan blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d (pronounced \u201cwee-peeles) from various villages including her own. She also makes the pretty, adorned aprons that the women wear as part of their daily attire. Juliana not only manufactures and sells her products in her usual venue but also takes special orders as well which she delivers every eight days.\r\n\r\nJuliana\u2019s business is progressing well and looking toward the future, she realizes that she needs to keep injecting financial capital to it. For that reason, she is applying for her 3rd loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and is requesting a loan of US$720. She will use the funds to buy different kinds of fabrics, yarns, and beads to decorate the huipiles. Juliana is excited at this opportunity to as it will allow her to sustain and grow the business. The income generated will be used to provide a better quality of life for the family including opportunities for improved healthcare and education. One of the biggest achievements that Juliana has achieved is having her 20-year-old daughter in law school. Juliana and her husband are making it a priority to keep each of their six children in school as they are aware that this is a real key to a more successful future for them. Juliana only attended school through the sixth grade as her parents thought that was enough time for her.\r\n\r\nJuliana is the Secretary and Member of the Board of Directors of the \u201cBuganvilias\u201d Trust Bank. She, along with the rest of the members of the group, are most excited to receive new loans. Many of the ladies are involved in textile production and will use their loans to sustain and improve their business. They are most grateful for this opportunity and look forward to a more successful future for themselves, their families and their community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1427997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy different kinds of fabrics, yarns, and beads.

He is very excited to be taking out his third Kiva loan. From the time he received his first loan in 2012, Edson\u2019s business has grown significantly. He has purchased additional equipment like a trading booth to better serve his customers.  With his working capital loans, he has been able to offer additional services to his customer base such as mobile airtime. He also opened another outlet in his hometown of Chililabombwe.

Having more cash in hand will allow Joseph to serve more customers, which will provide him with additional income. Joseph is hopeful that once he starts making this additional profit, he can purchase a laptop for enhanced service delivery to his customer base. \r\n\r\nJoseph is grateful for the opportunity to be connected with Kiva lenders.

Their daughter just began her studies at elementary school. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of 4,600,000 MNT to buy building materials such as fiberglass, wallpaper, vacuum insulated windows and foam. Using those materials, he wants to insulate and repair the interior parts of the house as he already renovated the outer parts using his savings. After renovation, his house will no longer lose its heat through its walls and windows and then his family will live in a comfortable and warm place without worrying about the incoming winter. Also they will burn less coal for heating thus releasing less pollutants into the air; a significant contribution to the efforts against air pollution.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Analyn earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nAnalyn is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nAnalyn dreams of expanding her business and hopes to have a better life for her family.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies there.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1428240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T12:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T12:10:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4412.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771698},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3677.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824737},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2941.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478562}],"funded_date":"2013-09-15T14:50:57Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:52:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":605815,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alma is married with four school-age children.

Zurab is the only one who makes money in his household.  Specifically, he is employed by a private auto company and provides the organization with the technical materials. His small wage is hardly enough to cover food and everyday expenses. That is why Zurab decided to start his own business. All of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his lack of experience in the business. \r\n\r\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, Zurab applied for credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva. This program enables the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $2,000 will help him to purchase a minibus. Once the minibus is purchased, he will transport passengers on the minibus line in return for a service fee.

The men are considered brothers by the community because they are always together doing things, talking, and helping one another. They live in a small, quiet town, where transportation used to be a problem, but taxis are now readily available.\r\n\r\nMarce, 40, represents the group and has been married for 18 years. She has three dependent children who are in school. Marce is hardworking and enterprising. She has three businesses: a diner, a small grocery shop, and selling clothing. She started selling clothing when her mother gave her clothing as a gift 15 years ago, and she works at this job Wednesday through Saturday. She has been managing her grocery store Sunday through Tuesday for four years.  \u201cI wanted to start another business to increase my income and help pay household expenses.\u201d Her grocery shop is in one of the local markets. \u201cI started selling sandwiches and tacos four years ago, but my customers liked my recipes so much that I decided to open a diner to offer more items.\u201d Marce's diner is open every day and is managed by her employees while she is at her other two businesses. \r\n\r\nRafael also sells clothing and has applied for a loan to buy more. Marce's businesses are successful, though her diner has competition. \u201cI think my diner stands out because the food is delicious, and the juices are 100% natural.\u201d The owners of her prior location asked her to move, as they wanted to run the diner. Marce moved to a space where the owners are very nice, and she was able to put in air conditioning. She says she is very lucky. The new location is less visible, but customers know where to find the best food. \r\n\r\nMarce dreams of growing her businesses and opening another diner. She smiles and says, \u201cI will name it Maricela 2.\u201d Her current diner is called Cocina Maricela.

She is 53 years old and married with eight children ages 13 to 34. Wilma has been engaged in farming tomatoes for 14 years now. She is asking for a loan of 6,000 PHP to buy fertilizer and seedlings and to pay for the labor of the hired help.

Her husband wants to grow his business by expanding his shop and his inventories. Therefore, Mumtaz requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband could expand his general store. With the help of this loan her husband will buy flour, pulses (peas and beans), soap, detergent, etc. to sell. \r\n\r\nMumtaz wants to have a baby girl, but due to some physical disease she is unable to give birth to a baby. Through the store's profit amount she will get better medical treatment so that she could have a baby. She says thank you to Kiva's field partner, BRAC Pakistan, and to the honorable lenders who would take warmth in participating through their support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1428275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

As a result of her hard work, today Ainagul has two milk cows, one horse, one bull calf, and 40 sheep.  Her monthly income is 5,000 somi (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Ainagul applied to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 somi (KGS) to buy cows in order to increase the size of her herd.  Ainagul plans to invest the profits from her loan in further increasing the number of cattle she has, as well as save money for her children's future

My parents work as laborers, and they work on other people\u2019s land.\r\n\r\nThis loan is very helpful for me to continue my study and help me to get a job after I graduate from this school. The distance from my home to school is about 7 kilometers, and I go by motorcycle. In this vocational school, I will learn automotives, because I love machinery and my hobby is automotives. The kind of work which I dream of is to become a mechanic. I hope I can get much knowledge at this school and hope I can practice in my real life daily. Besides automotives, my other hobby is football. I spend my free time studying what I learned in school.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for this loan and lenders who give me this loan so I can continue my study.\r\n\r\nIn the picture is Rori and Fikri,

He and his partner are in a common-law relationship.  He started out working as a truck driver, but some time ago he began transporting people with a minibus that he acquired.  Most of his trips are to the towns in the western part of the Department of Antioquia.  \r\n\r\nDiego is active, hardworking, and dedicated to his job and his family, who serves as his primary motivation in life.  For this reason, he looks for new ways to get ahead and overcome the obstacles that directly affect his work, such as the high price of fuel and spare parts for maintaining his vehicle.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan so that he can invest in the purchase of a set of tires for his minibus and mandatory vehicle insurance.  This will enable him to provide better service and offer better safety when transporting passengers.  As a result, Diego will be able to strengthen his business and generate more income to sustain his household and provide for the well-being of his young daughter.  \r\n\r\nIn the midterm, Diego dreams of acquiring an upgraded model of minibus that is comfortable and spacious so that his passengers will prefer his service.  This will lead to a better financial situation for his family so that he can provide his daughter with an excellent education that will help forge a prosperous and successful future for when she grows up.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1429091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a set of tires for his minibus and mandatory vehicle insurance.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAnalina operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat homecooked meals during evenings, when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and a means of frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one person to two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than purchasing raw food. Analina's regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. \r\n\r\nAnalina earns a minimum 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. To help continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 18,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more products, such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings and frozen foods. \r\n\r\nAnalina dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes to have a good life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His family consists of his elderly father, wife and four school age children (a daughter - 8 years old and three sons - 9, 13 and 15 years old).  Zohrab is working in the local self governance body, but the salary he receives there is not even close to covering the family's everyday costs. To take care of his large family, Zohrab breeds a livestock of cows, pigs, piglets, and cultivates alfalfa and grapes. He now wants to maintain and enlarge his livestock a little bit. To meet his goal, Zohrab plans to buy a cow, five steers and some forage for them. In order to do so, there is a need for a loan of USD 3,000, which he hopes to collect with the support of the lenders.

six happy and enterprising members. Every one of them has a business activity with the single goal of offering their families a better quality of life. This group is located in the municipality of Tierra Blanca, where the main industries are trade and livestock.\r\n\r\nDominga is one of the members of this group. She is 44 years old and only studied up to secondary school. She is married to Eduardo, who works as a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nShe says that from a very young age, her parents taught her to work. When she got married, she decided to start her own business selling Mexican antojitos (corn-based dishes) and cosmetics so that she could help her husband to provide for their children and give them an education. With her hard work and effort, she achieved this goal, but she continues working to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe sells cosmetics and antojitos door-to-door to neighbors and friends. Since she has been making sales for some time, she is very well-known and she has good clients. She thinks that what makes her business different from others is the friendly manner and energy that she puts into her sales.\r\n\r\nThis loan from Vision Fund will help her to buy a variety of cosmetics (lipstick, nail polish, perfumes, creams, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and make-up) and supplies to make Mexican antojitos.\r\n\r\nDominga hopes that her business continues to prosper, because in the future she would like to open a small restaurant where she can offer her delicious antojitos and fast food to her clients.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMaria: Pineapple juice sales\r\nRosa: Cosmetics sales\r\nLaura: Mechanic shop\r\nRomarica: Confectionery\r\nLaura: Beauty salon"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1422504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics and ingredients to make Mexican antojitos.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca, Ver","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romarica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3800},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3800},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3800},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3800},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":295,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3861.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227973},{"amount":294.88,"local_amount":3798.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3859.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991818},{"amount":295.12,"local_amount":3801.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3862.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644466},{"amount":295,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3861.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877926},{"amount":295,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3861.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766961}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T20:15:57Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":605920,"name":"Rukhsana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukhsana is 38 years old.

She also offers cell phone minutes and charging. \r\n\r\nWith support from the city government, Mar\u00eda has taken several courses in business management that have added to her experience as an independent entrepreneur. To this combination of experience and study, Mar\u00eda has added the effort, tenacity, and dedication that have allowed her to sustain her business in the face of numerous challenges. Two of the greatest obstacles she faces are poor weather and changes in the neighborhoods where she works. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is always seeking new ways to increase the range of products that she can offer in order to meet the needs and tastes of her changing customer base. She is therefore applying for her third loan cycle and plans to use the loan funds to stock her business.

He lives with his mother, father, wife and two small children (a 4-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son). Arsen is currently a taxi driver, but his earnings do not support his large family. \r\n\r\nTo be able to meet the family's daily needs, Arsen also breeds cows, sheep, piglets and hens. He is also involved in beekeeping. Arsen and his family are cultivating some wheat, barley, beans, potatoes, grass and nuts. Those are the main sources of the family\u2019s income. As their needs increase day by day, Arsen wants to increase the amount of cattle he owns by buying two more calves. To reach that goal he needs a loan of $1,000 USD. \r\n\r\nArsen has previously taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back because the family faced difficulties. However, thanks to their recent hard work, Arsen is able to run his agribusiness in a way that ensures that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. The lenders will provide great support to Arsen and his family by giving them an opportunity to receive the loan and to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1428379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The group chose its name because it is a piece of biblical praise that they liked. This group is made up of five happy, enterprising people, each one of which pursues an economic activity with the goal of improving their quality of life. This group is located in a community called Huixcolotla where the main sources of employment are raising livestock and growing sugarcane.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Rosa is 37 years old; she was able to study only until secondary school. She has four children with her husband, Julian, who learned the carpentry trade when he was working in the United States. When Julian returned home, he decided to open his own carpentry business. Rosa says that they work very hard in the workshop to support their children and provide them with better academic opportunities in the future. They specialize in making furniture (tables, beds, bookshelves, chests of drawers, armoires, windows and doors) and in special orders from customers. They have ten years of experience in the business and during this time they have built their clientele based on the quality of their work; they put significant amounts of time and effort into each piece because they know it will brighten the lives of the family who uses it. \r\nA loan from Vision Fund will help Rosa and Julian purchase wood, nails, contact glue, wood screws and varnish, and to maintain their equipment. This will allow them to continue their business; Rosa hopes that it will keep growing and that someday their children will work alongside them. \r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nBenjamin, lime sales\r\nLucio, pig sales\r\nAzahel, sugarcane farming\r\nElena, bakery\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1430381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wood, nails, contact glue, wood screws and varnish, and to maintain equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huixcolotla, Tierra Blanca, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azahel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4254.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227974},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4254.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991819},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4254.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644467},{"amount":226.43,"local_amount":2926.18,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2963.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877927},{"amount":423.57,"local_amount":5473.82,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5544.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766962}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T02:02:09Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatrice Peaslee","image":null}},{"id":605943,"name":"Mariafe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariafe is 54 years old, married, and has three children.

However, the low salaries are not enough to meet the basic needs of their family. \r\n\r\nAni and her husband are involved in horticulture as well. This is an important source of income for them. They grow peaches, apricots and apples. Ani's husband helps her to sell the fruit in the local market. As life gets more expensive day by day, Ani wants to find new sources of income. \r\n\r\nA loan of $3,000 USD will help her to buy a cow, fertilizer and tractor fuel.  It will also help to pay for the water bills and to pay for the workforce to be able to continue the growing and the harvesting of the fruit.\r\n\r\nAs this is Ani's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who have not had access to credit products before because they have no credit history.

She lives in the small village of Samtredia district with her husband and two infant children. She graduated from teaching college and works as a teacher at the local public school. Unfortunately, a teacher\u2019s salary is not enough to make ends meet for a family. \r\n\r\nIn the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps residents to make a living. The family is involved in the husbandry business. They have three cows and produce dairy products to sell. Additionally, they have a plot of agricultural land where watermelon is grown. They sell the harvested watermelon seasonally. \r\n\r\nWith the loan of $2,500 USD, Natia will build a mill and will get orders to grind corn. Natia hopes that the business will be successful, as there are many families who grow corn in their village. It is obvious that the job will be hard, as she has no experience in this field. However, she and her husband are ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her business gradually. \r\n\r\nNatia decided to start this family business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Her credit requests were rejected several times because she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit through a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  The start-up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased with help from Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1428383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has no additional family members. She has a business of tailoring at the market and sells on both wholesale and retail basis. She has been in the tailoring business for 13 years and she works six days a week.   She has applied for a loan of Ugandan shillings 1,200,000 from Kiva partner MCDTSACCO in order to buy more rolls of cloth and threads. \r\n\r\nHer major business challenges include seasonality (the rainy season) which hinders her customers to reach her and defaulters.

One obstacle she has is the lack of reliable power supply in her area and that having access to electricity for only a few hours a day leaves little predictability about the exact hours when she will be able to work.
