He would like to improve his business and increase his income by lowering his expenses. Currently he is paying high fees for the transportation of his goods, and he would like to eliminate these expenses by purchasing a motorcycle wagon - a 3-wheeled motorcycle with a large flatbed used for transporting goods. To be able to pay for the cost he is taking a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

As the income is too small and not enough to cover everyday costs, Tamar decided to request a loan and start a clothing-trading business with the loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Her credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo - Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.\r\n\r\nWith the loan of $700 she will purchase clothing at wholesale prices and sell them in her community door-to-door. Her regular customers will be her neighbors. She plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women and children. It is obvious that the job is hard for Tamar, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her trading business gradually.

She is from the south of the country where she lives with her 3 children whom she is raising alone since the death of her husband. As a widow with limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, she is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home.  She uses her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has 10 years experience primarily making dresses for women and children and occasionally other fabric household items. To improve her work conditions and ensure she can work during the hours when there is no electricity provided in her area, she would like to buy a generator and also a new sewing machine. To pay for these purchases she is taking a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor.  These borrowers would otherwise be unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan.

They all work together to support the family.\r\n\r\nShe is a hardworking person and currently works in agriculture, planting thyme on parcels of land owned by her family that are just a few steps from their house. She\u2019s learned this from her parents since she was a child. She now works half the day and spends the other half studying to be a primary school teacher. She has been working independently in agriculture for 10 years, helping her parents economically so that she could finish her last year of high school. This was how she decided to start her own crop and make it her main source of income. \r\n\r\nShe has seen that her crop generates a good income. So, she wants to expand cultivation by requesting a loan of GTQ 4,500.00 (Guatemalan Quetzales) to buy tomillo seeds and organic fertilizer. She needs these for planting so she can have successful sales and improve her income, along with her family.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue expanding her crop and helping her family improve its living conditions. She also wants to support her siblings so they can continue studying and finish their academic studies.

Gladys likes this form of credit because she gets to meet with the other group members and establish a daily work routine with them.  \r\n\r\nSra. Gladys is 33 years old, in a common-law relationship, and has three children (ages 11, 6, and 3).  Her two oldest children attend a small school in the city.  Her husband works for a private company.  They do not own a home, so they live in a rental property.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Gladys has managed her own business for eight years.  She sells shoes as a street vendor.  Gladys works Monday through Friday, but without a set schedule.  Her work enables her to look after her family and still contribute to the household finances.  The money from her loan will be invested in the purchase of shoes.  Her goal is to have her own shop where she can sell her merchandise.     \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":1428179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes to sell.

Franklin lives in this city. He is 43 years old, single and lives with his parents. He has been a member of the communal bank for five years. He really appreciates the help that this institution has given him in his efforts to get ahead. Franklin is a very hardworking man who is using his knowledge to get ahead in life. He works in his family's woodworking and furniture-making business, where he sells his creations. They make beds, other types of furniture and anything else you can make out of wood. They sell out of their workshop as well as in other cities, where they sell at very good prices. Their business has been around for over 50 years and has been passed down from generation to generation. Franklin decided to take out a new loan similar to the previous one, since it helped him tremendously: he was able to weather a very tough situation precisely because the loan enabled him to invest in supplies to make furniture. This loan will be used to buy wood, paint, nails and other carpentry materials that they need to make their products. His dream is to keep in business and to sell more furniture.

She has three children who reached a degree of education that enables them to get ahead in life. They currently study at university and live with her on week-ends, since they reside in the capital, where the university is, during the week. Though she is married, Reyna lives alone, since her husband is abroad, where he works in construction, gardening, and painting. During the week, a niece, who is in the ninth grade, and a daughter-in-law keep her company, so that she will not feel lonely. She fattens and sells chickens for a living, her main customers being the inhabitants of her district, although she sometimes takes her products to the market. She has had this business for five years. She had started with egg-laying hens, but they all died suddenly so she switched tracks. She educated herself about chicken-raising, by asking people around her and also thanks to the information her children looked up for her on the Internet. Before this, she only did housework and watched over other people's poultry. Twelve kilometres separate her house from the place where she sells her products. She goes there in her vehicle and buys the supplies she needs for the farm in the same place. Reyna will use the loan to build a feed silo to store feed for her two cows, who are about to give milk. Thus, she hopes that her milk production will be higher and will enable her to have an extra income. Thanks to the silo, she knows her cows will be well-fed, and will produce abundant milk. One of her projects for the future is to revisit the egg-laying hen business, which, before nature turned against her, was one of her main sources of income. Another of her dreams, this one concerning her family, is to see her three children graduate from university and have better chances in life. She is also thinking about starting to raise milk cows in order to finance her egg-laying hen venture. She knows that, as long as her children and God are on her side, she needs but efforts and sacrifices to reach her goal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1430533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to build a feed silo to store feed for her two cows, who are about to give milk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T09:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Milagro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":155.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":147.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":160.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.95,"local_amount":20.95,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":20.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716639},{"amount":113.23,"local_amount":113.23,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":113.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621915},{"amount":144.41,"local_amount":144.41,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":144.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903338},{"amount":321.41,"local_amount":321.41,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":321.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243679}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T01:46:04Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:20:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":606075,"name":"Gayane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gayane is 51 years old and lives in Kapan city.

They have three children aged 13, 10 and two, who they live with in their own home. Daysi's work involves selling foodstuffs such as rice, sugar, milk, and other items. During the day, she goes out onto the street in front of the house to exhibit her products, which she buys in the local wholesale market to then sell on. In addition, at night she sells regional dishes. She goes out at 5pm and begins making her food. She has been doing this job for five years, and works alone. What she likes about her work is the fact that it allows her to make two incomes from home, and she has always loved cooking.

All of them are women who know each other very well. Their great friendship is what distinguishes them. They have been getting loans from VisionFund for two cycles. They live in a Mazahua community and still conserve their regional traditions. The most important crop there is corn. In fact, during the month of September, the people in the area can finally enjoy the ears of corn after several months of cultivation. The members chose the name Manita de \u00c1ngel because at the group representative's house there is a plant with that name. Alicia is 39 years old. She has been married for 22 years to Fabi\u00e1n who is a merchant. Together they have created a family with three children who are in school. Alicia sells accessory products such as beads, pins, headbands, antennas, threads, batteries, etc. She has been doing this for 22 years. Alicia remarked \u201cI started selling from a small tray, walking around the plazas. I started the initiative to sell myself.\"  This time, with the loan, Alicia will buy more merchandise since it is important to have products to offer. Alicia and her husband have difficulty selling their merchandise since they weren't allowed to set up in the plazas. but they worked really hard and were able to get a stable spot in the street market. Nonetheless, they also go out to sell in other places to cover a wider area and have more profit. Alicia's goal is to be able to have another stable spot, more than anything to grow her business. Her earnings will be a big help to pay for her children's education expenses. They really want to be able to go to college and improve their quality of life. The members of the group are Ana Elizabeth and Janet. They are going to use their loans to invest in clothes. Felisa, Celedonia, Josefina and Rosalba will use it to invest in cleaning supplies, and Irene will invest in sheep and chickens. They are very grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund for the loan. It will be a big help to grow their businesses, which will allow them to improve their and their families' quality of life.

","en":"Jedislenni is 28 years old. She is the mother of one 8 year old son and lives with her romantic partner. Seven years ago, she started working in a women's clothing store as a counter salesperson. A few months ago, she decided to go off on her own and she opened her own business. It consists of selling blouses designed by her. After she designs them she orders them to be made and then distributes them to different customers in the city. She does all of these activities alone, but during special times she hires someone else to help her because the number of orders goes up, especially the second half of the year. This requires her to have good working capital. She is an active, enterprising, creative and driven woman.  In order to keep getting ahead, she is asking for this loan to invest in buying raw materials (fabric, accessories, thread, buttons) and to pay the sewers who make her designs. This allows her to increase her working capital and get more production to satisfy the requirements and needs of the customers who are stocking up for the Christmas season. All of this is reflected in the increase of profitability and income she makes. With them, she wants to keep investing in her business until she attains her dream os having her own brand that is recognized in the marketplace, getting production to distribute wholesale and generate more employment opportunities. This way, Jedislenni will be able to improve her family's quality of life and well being.

The second oldest is 17 and only studied the basic level, because he didn't want to keep studying, preferring to help his parents with their businesses. The third is 13 and isn't studying, and the fourth is 10 and is in the fourth grade in a local school. The fifth is 9 and is in the third grade, and the youngest is 7, is in the first grad,  and is studying in the same school as her older siblings. \r\n\r\nThey inherited the land that they farm, which is located in the same place as their home. Teresa de Jes\u00fas dreams of buying a plot of land to grow more crops so as to leave her children an inheritance with which they can look after themselves, and to support them in their education, since she was unable to study, so that they are successful in life.

She lives with two of her four children in her father's house.  Marta became a widow four years ago and so become head of the family.  Her children love her very much.  Marta has a stable job in a local state school, where she works every day and her main income comes from her monthly salary.  She uses this salary to pay for her son's further education studies - he is studying in Lima and, Marta says, she \"wants to give him the best\" she can.  However, with many bills to pay, Marta had the idea of starting to sell meals in the town where she works.  She works out of a tent which is strategically placed in the school where she works.  Marta is well-known as she has been working there for 23 years. Marta's business is going very well and, thanks to her profits, she has an extra income.  This is her second loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support being provided, as it helps her to improve her business.  For this reason, she promises to make her repayments on time.

","en":"Gulnara is 48, widowed, and has two sons. Her children are grown and work at private constructions sites. They live with their mother and help with the farm. Her main source of income is animal husbandry, which Gulnara has been involved in for many years. She started the business with 1000 som (KGS). Gulnara's industriousness has enabled her monthly income to reach 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her efforts, she has been successful. Currently her farm has 1 dairy cow with a calf. With the goal of increasing her number of animals, Gulnara applied for a loan at the Bai Tushum & Partners microloan bank in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow. Gulnara plans to put the income earned from the loan into increasing her number of animals, and she hopes to marry off her older son in the future as well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1408067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Widowed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1821},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1986},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2043},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2103},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2164},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2227},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2292},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2359},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2431}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.41,"local_amount":3591,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014093},{"amount":79.88,"local_amount":3804,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3912.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426988},{"amount":84.61,"local_amount":4029,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4143.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553043},{"amount":43.66,"local_amount":2103,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":459019486},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":2164,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053251},{"amount":46.77,"local_amount":2227,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2290.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749405},{"amount":48.13,"local_amount":2292,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2357.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178133},{"amount":49.54,"local_amount":2359,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2426.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462760},{"amount":51,"local_amount":2431,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2500.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":529946758}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T14:33:12Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:08:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peter and Lynne Weil","image":null}},{"id":605961,"name":"Warni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The story of Saeful, son of Warni:\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a first grader in vocational school now.

accountant since his childhood, so since he finished school, he enrolled in college. He is currently in his second year.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Azam's mother has been sick with gastrointestinal cancer.

She has six children with ages ranging from 8 years to 21 years. She describes herself to be credible. She operates a farm where she keeps dairy cows that produce milk for selling. She has been involved in this business for 15 years. Her business is located in a profitable place, and her primary customers are local residents and business people.\r\n\r\nShe describes her biggest business challenge to be inflation of animal-feed prices, which reduces her profits.

Por esa raz\u00f3n, promete ser puntual con el pago de sus cuotas.\nBertha, invertir\u00e1 los S\/.300 soles en la compra de comestibles como arroz, leche,az\u00facar, entre otros, para abastecer su tienda de comestibles. \n","en":"Bertha, age 51, is a happy woman because she lives with her husband, Alipio.  They have four children.  Only one of the children lives with her in the house that she inherited from her parents.  Eight years ago she undertook the business of selling groceries in the front part of her house.  She comments that ever since then it has gone very well.  She was the first one to sell food in her village, which is far from the city.\r\n\r\nShe now hopes to be able to increase her varied and nutritious food products.  She is one of the most well-known villagers because of her charisma and good service.  She comments that in addition to her food store, she also like to plant and raise animals as a good daughter of the countryside.  However, she does these business activities occasionally.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva.  She is grateful for the financial support provided; it helps her to improve her business.  For this reason she pledges to be punctual with her payments.  Bertha will use the 300 soles to buy groceries like rice, milk, and sugar, among others, to stock her grocery store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1430607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries like rice, milk, and sugar, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T14:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T14:30:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":346.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147540}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T13:51:58Z","paid_date":"2014-08-02T10:00:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":606145,"name":"Jacinta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacinta is a 32-year-old, married woman.

She is married with four children between the ages of 17 years and 25 years.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Kadiatu established her palm oil business. She began her business because she wanted to generate her own source of income. She works at the business from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm, seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to purchase more palm oil to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and increase her business. In the future, Kadiatu plans to expand her business more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1428722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase more palm oil to expand her business.

With this investment she'll avoid making many trips to the city to buy these supplies in small amounts, as it costs her money and takes up a lot of time. With the supplies at her house she can manage her crops well. This will give her a higher yield and increased profits. Her dream is to open a shop, to have a daily income and help the neighbors, offering them basic food goods.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nElvira dreams that one day her store will become a grocery store and hopes to have her house renovated.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nShirley hopes that her business will get stronger and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. There, she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The group wish to continue their relationship for better or for worse. They all live in a town which is about 62 kms away from the town capital and it is also the second most populated town in the state of Manipur, which is one of the North-Eastern states in India.\r\n\r\nChinzanian runs a tea-stall in the village, and the stall is located at the junction point of three villages. Villagers, nearby residents and passengers waiting for public transport usually stop at the tea-stall for tea, 'puri', toast, boiled egg, and omelette. Her love for work is appreciated by the group members as well as by villagers. Household expenses are borne by her as her husband's income is mainly used for their children's education and other family expenses. She is always in need of capital money as family priorities need to be taken care of and borrowing money from money lenders is possible only at a high rate of interest.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan, Chinzanian will purchase stock like wheat flour, milk powder, and liquified petroleum gas. She wants to run the business efficiently and generate more income to manage her family expenses. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful work shown with the group and she wishes to continue working under the umbrella of Kiva and WSDS. She says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in small businesses like selling chilli, 'paan-dukan' and running a variety shop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1428570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase stock like wheat flour and powdered milk for the tea-shop ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kholnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chingliankim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinzanian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T07:26:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":606349,"name":"Diomema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of five children, Diomema works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a general store.

cultivating \u201cchigua\u201d, beans, and corn, which are the predominant agriculture products from the region.  They each live on around 200 USD per month to maintain their families and they lack basic access to infrastructure and services such as water, electricity and concrete households.  \n\nLuis Alberto is one borrower of this group of three who is interested in acquiring a solar home system on credit.  He is 27 years old and lives in the community of Aguacatal, in the state of Campeche, with his wife Elisa and his little three-year-old kid Santos. \n\nLuis Alberto is a proud farmer - since his childhood his father taught him to love and respect the soil.  Nowadays he harvests maize and beans his family uses for self-consumption and also to sell at the local community market.  Nevertheless, he is able to harvest maize and beans only at autumn and springtime, which is why his wife Elisa started to do handcrafts and sell them in the local market.  These activities allow Luis Alberto to earn an income of about $200 USD per month, money he must distribute to the maintenance of his household and family.  Currently, they rely on hazardous diesel oil lamps to have light during the nighttime, which incurs expenses of around 10% of their monthly income.

Only two granddaughters who are 14 and 7 years old live with them; both are attending school.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband have worked in agriculture for 40 years and that\u2019s how they\u2019ve supported their children.  She comments that at the age of 65 she still helps her husband with the agricultural work.  Her day starts at 4:30am.  She first prepares her family\u2019s breakfast and coffee for her husband because he leaves early.  Then, she takes her calves to pasture and then head out to meet her husband where she works for about four hours and returns home to prepare lunch.  This is how her entire life has been.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy a cow that\u2019s producing milk because she wants to take advantage of the good grass to earn some dollars.  Her dream is to buy about 3 dairy cows to provide food so that she and her husband who are of an age now won\u2019t have to still work in agriculture.  She dreams with seeing her granddaughters graduate from university because she never had the chance to go to school and her children did not want to continue in school either.  \r\n\r\nGod willing, she wants to use profits to repay the Fundaci\u00f3n\u2019s loan thus leaving the doors open.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1430755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T18:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T18:50:05Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":685.18,"local_amount":685.18,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":685.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857045},{"amount":77.94,"local_amount":77.94,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":77.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088757},{"amount":136.88,"local_amount":136.88,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":136.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818178}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T18:29:45Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:43:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":606450,"name":"Anne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anne is a 48-year-old married woman.

Her previous loan was a big help in her business. She was able to buy the needed spare parts and accessories for her tricycle. The loan also helped in the education of her child. She has a direct-selling business, for additional income.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan. She will use this loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of the tricycle unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nErlinda dreams of obtaining an additional unit of tricycle, and hopes to have a happy family.

For 43 years, she has learned everything related to sewing, taking courses at different institutions, because she has always liked everything to do with handicrafts. Also in that time, it was very common for women to carry out that kind of work. During her working life, she worked in various sewing shops, but when one of her children was diagnosed with a serious illness, she decided to become independent and started the workshop in the house where she lives, in order to care for her child and her mother, who is 85. Sadly, her son passed away, but with the support of her family, she has been able to manage her pain and move forward. \r\n\r\nCurrently, her main customers are businesses who hire her to make diverse products. She works long days, starting at 7:00 am and into the wee hours of the night, depending on the amount of work she has, in order to complete the orders on time. Ana is asking for the loan to buy a serger and finish paying off a tabletop machine that she was buying in installments. With this, she will improve her installed capacity to improve her production times and speed up the process, which will help her turn in her orders quickly. She will have the possibility of increasing her customer base and therefore her income, with which she can continue meeting her household expenses.  Ana, with her entrepreneurial spirit, motivated by her family and with the enthusiasm to keep moving forward, fights tirelessly to achieve her dream of expanding her workshop, so that she can create more jobs and increase her sales. This way, in the medium term, she can buy her own house and give her family greater comfort and a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1431105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

For 25 years, she has worked as a tailor. She learned this skill by taking classes from different organizations and then she started working at various tailoring businesses as an operator. She did this work for 24 years until they didn't hire her due to her age. A year ago, she set up her own workshop where she provides tailoring and dressmaking services. This has allowed her to earn income to take care of her family.\r\n\r\nBlanca is a kind woman who is dedicated to her work. She is responsible, hard-working, and likes what she does. Every day, she works to move forward with her business. She is requesting this loan to buy wholesale products (fabric, thread, elastic, lace) and to perform maintenance on her machines. This will allow her to have a greater variety of materials to offer her customers and it will improve her production because the machines will work well. All of this will be reflected in increased sales and, ultimately, the income she receives.\r\n\r\nBlanca dreams of having a larger tailoring workshop with better machinery so she can offer employment opportunities to mothers who are heads of households. This means she will not only improve her family's quality of life, but also that of others who are affected by this process and who, in the near future, will enjoy the fruits of her labor."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1431108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale products (fabric, thread, elastic, lace) and to perform maintenance on her machines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Ibonne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54702},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56214},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57768},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59365},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":61006},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62692},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":64425},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66206},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68036},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69917},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71850},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73836},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75877},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77975},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80131}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.51},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.53,"local_amount":67678,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":69235.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807494},{"amount":37.62,"local_amount":71659,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":73308.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095586},{"amount":41.47,"local_amount":78989,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":80806.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074638},{"amount":38.34,"local_amount":73038,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":74718.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009835},{"amount":65.53,"local_amount":124808,"processed_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":127680.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523438},{"amount":58.49,"local_amount":111404,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":113967.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227161},{"amount":44.8,"local_amount":85337,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":87301.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480244851},{"amount":203.22,"local_amount":387087,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":395995.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855600}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T19:32:32Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T14:38:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Polenske","image":1311923}},{"id":608126,"name":"Luz Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal SOLIDARIDAD -

Her father taught her how to take care of animals, a lesson which has come in handy all her life.

His principal crops are potatoes, corn, broad beans, and peas; he grows them on the land that he inherited from his parents in addition to some new fields that he bought through his hard work. He says that he is a responsible person because he keeps the income from his business activities separated, especially what he earns from farming and from livestock. He mentions that he has a large number of cows and bulls that he is always selling every six months according to timing of their maturity; the cows provide him with milk every day. \r\n\r\nNow Carlos would like to improve his crops for this season, when prices will be good. This is his first loan with Kiva, and he feels grateful for the financial support that he is receiving so that he can forge ahead. In addition, he promises to make his payments punctually. \r\n\r\nCarlos will invest the 1,000 soles [PEN] in the purchase of organic soil amendments to fertilize his crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1431129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":64.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":69.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":70.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":77.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":101.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.17,"local_amount":64.44,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":66.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353845},{"amount":26.15,"local_amount":69.74,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":72.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905611},{"amount":26.32,"local_amount":70.18,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-21T10:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":72.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091596},{"amount":28.65,"local_amount":76.41,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":79.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778192},{"amount":269.71,"local_amount":719.23,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-13T09:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":746.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598600}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T15:20:45Z","paid_date":"2014-03-13T09:16:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":606479,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is from Nakuru and he is 30 years old; his spouse, Eunice, is a farmer; and he has four children aged 8, 6, 3 and 1 year old.\r\n\r\nHe is in the business of selling firewood; his business has been in operation for the past 2 years.

Her work consists of buying and breeding the animals, which she then raises and fattens for an average of six months until they reach maturity; then she sells them in the market that takes place on Sundays in her city.

en el a\u00f1o 2000 en su condici\u00f3n de separada y madre de 2 hijos peque\u00f1os, hoy en las edades de 17 a 15 a\u00f1os, debi\u00f3 asumir sola su roll de generadora de ingresos, para lograr el bienestar de su familia; por eso empez\u00f3 vendiendo pasabocas fritos, los cuales le produjeron su propia posibilidad de tener dinero para sostener sus hijos. En la medida en que sus hijos crecieron ella necesitaba resolver mas necesidades b\u00e1sicas y con esta sola tarea no alcanzaba a lograrlo. Por eso se fue a las colmenas (peque\u00f1os puntos de venta) del centro de la ciudad y empez\u00f3 a trabajar en una de ellas como vendedora. Con esta experiencia en el mercado, dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s decidi\u00f3 independizarse con un dinero, una parte ahorrada y la otra producto de un pr\u00e9stamo de alto costo, que invirti\u00f3 en la compra de calzado, d\u00e1ndose a conocer en su clientela y entre sus proveedores, que empezaron a facilitarle cr\u00e9dito; cuando se estabiliz\u00f3 un poco, logr\u00f3 reunir dinero y alquil\u00f3 una colmena, donde vendi\u00f3 mucha mercanc\u00eda econ\u00f3mica durante un periodo de tiempo, hasta que se organiz\u00f3 con su c\u00f3nyuge y este compr\u00f3 vitrinas para que trabajara cerca a sus hijos, que ya eran 3 y necesitaban de su atenci\u00f3n cercana y aunque al principio atend\u00eda los dos negocios, al final se decidi\u00f3 por el que estaba ubicado en su casa. As\u00ed naci\u00f3 su hoy miscel\u00e1nea, ubicada en su residencia, donde vende de todo un poco y all\u00ed ha construido una clientela con la cual se encuentra posicionada. En la actualidad su meta es ampliar su negocio, teniendo un stock de mercanc\u00eda de mucha rotaci\u00f3n, para m\u00e1s adelante lograr el m\u00e1ximo aprovechamiento de su infraestructura, ofreciendo servicios de impresi\u00f3n. Ella poco a poco est\u00e1 dando pasos importantes y por eso se cuando se acerc\u00f3 por primera vez  a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, compr\u00f3  mercancia como calzado, ropa, cosm\u00e9ticos al por mayor, de contado y sobre pedido. Luz en la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva con el cual comprar\u00e1 mercancia sobre pedidos al pormayor y de contado, como ropa, calzado accesorios, cosm\u00e9ticos etc. Ella dice a sus finaciadores que est\u00e1 muy agradcida con los cr\u00e9ditos, por que es un apoyo que le ha facilitado el mejoramiento de sus ingresos familiares y guarda la esperanza de un futuro mejor. Con su credikiva planea incrementar sus ventas, sus utilidades pues tiene una clientela fija que en temporadas altamente comerciales, como el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o, hacen que su inversi\u00f3n sea muy exitosa. ","en":"In the year 2000 Luz was separated and the mother of two small children (who are now 17- and 15-years old respectively).  She had to assume the roll of wage earner for the well-being of her family.  She started selling fried snacks, which gave her the opportunity to earn money to support her children.  As her children grew, Luz had even more expenses to cover, and she couldn't do it just selling snacks.  She went to the \"colmenas\" (small sales stalls) downtown and got a job working in one of them.  Two years later, with the experience she gained at the market, some saved money and some money borrowed at a high interest rate, Luz decided to go out on her own.  She invested in the purchase of footwear and made herself known to her customers and to her suppliers, who started providing her with credit.  When her business became a bit more established, Luz was able to put together some money and rent a \"colmena\" where she sold a lot of low-cost merchandise for a time.  Once she got organized with her husband, he purchased display cases so she could work near her children, who then numbered three and needed her closer by.  Although she at first worked at both businesses, in the end Luz decided to stick with the one set up in her home.  And that is how the corner shop she has today was born.  \r\nThe shop is located in her home, and she sells a little of everything.  Luz has built up a clientele, with which she is well-positioned.  Luz's current goal is to expand her business.  Her stock rotates quickly, and in future she wants to take full advantage of her infrastructure by offering a printing service.\r\nLittle by little, Luz is taking important steps.  When she approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the first time, she purchased wholesale, overstock and cash merchandise such as footwear, clothing and cosmetics.  Luz is currently requesting a \"credikiva,\" with which she will purchase wholesale, overstock and cash merchandise like clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics etc.  She wants her financial backers to know that she is very happy with the loans.  The support has made it easier for her to improve her family's income, and she holds hope for a better future.  With her \"credikiva,\" Luz plans to increase her sales and her profits, as she has a fixed clientele that in increased shopping times, like the second half of the year, make her investments very successful.

At a very young age, he began attending rehearsals for various musical groups and discovered that he had a talent for music.  Shortly thereafter, he was hired to teach classes in different towns and also began giving private lessons on his own so that he could generate income to support himself.  With some of his savings, he bought a sound system that he rents out for different events.  This provides additional income so that he can meet his basic needs.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of his experience and knowledge in this field, Anderson has now become a singer-songwriter.  Within a short time, he also decided to start a music school so that he could become financially stable.  He offers classes in voice, guitar, percussion, and piano.  In addition, he rents out a space that different groups can use for their rehearsals.  \r\n\r\nAnderson is a vigorous and active man who possesses an enterprising spirit, which has enabled him to make gradual progress.  He strives tirelessly to fulfill his dream of seeing his music school become one of the best and among the most recognized.  However, he is aware that he must work hard, with dedication, and with great effort.  This has motivated him to request the help of loan, which he will invest in the purchase of musical instruments (guitars, a piano, a percussion set, xylophones, and recorders).  This will expand his capacity so that he can accommodate more students, which will have a positive and direct effect on his finances since he will have more income.  In addition, he will be able to improve his quality of life.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1431019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to buy guitars, a piano, a percussion set, xylophones, and recorders for his music school.

","en":"Hoshimjon is a purposeful man accustomed to achieving everything on his own. He is 43 years old and from the region of J. Rumy. Hoshimjon is married and has three children. His children are his motivation, and it is because of them that he lives and works.  \r\n\r\nHe wants to start a business breeding cattle, but doesn't have enough start-up capital to implement his plan. For this reason, he has applied for a loan. From its profits, Hoshimjon hopes to build a house, since his old house is falling apart. Due to the climate in Tajikistan, he has needed to repair this house every year, but hasn't had the money for it. His family needs a place to live and he works tirelessly. We hope that he will succeed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1425980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy and resell cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rumy","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoshimjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1576,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":248.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":254.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":259.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":265.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":271.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":277}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":252.41,"local_amount":248.62,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":252.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419913343},{"amount":521.74,"local_amount":513.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":521.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561432},{"amount":269.41,"local_amount":265.37,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":269.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030333},{"amount":556.44,"local_amount":548.1,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":556.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459152687}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T17:06:54Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:45:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Max Prilutsky","image":1270958}},{"id":605473,"name":"Abulfaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abulfaz is a 53-year-old man, married and the father of 3 kids.
