This is a very profitable business and she is doing it together with her husband.\r\nSariyya is keeping a flock of sheep in her own yard. She fattens them and takes their meat to the central bazaar, where butchers and customers purchase from her. People use mutton for traditional dishes like kababs, dolmas, pilovs, etc.\r\nShe has taken a loan from Aqroinvest before and has a good loan history. This is going to be her third loan. This time she requires 2000 AZN to purchase 12 sheep in order to sell more meat in autumn. She is optimistic about this loan, because in autumn more people consume meat, due to the holidays and increased customers in restaurants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1427660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

51 years old and is a widow with just primary education. She lives in a small community called Palmerinda where the main sources of work are growing sugar cane and rearing livestock. She is a member of a group which has taken the name of their community so it is easy to locate them.\r\n\r\nFelicitas says that more than 16 years ago she set up a small grocery store in her home with the intention of creating her own source of work so she could give her family a better quality of life.

She has her own house that she shares with two of her daughters, two grandchildren, and her husband. Sonia sells clothing, shoes, and lingerie. She does this by selling to friends, neighbors and family members on credit, and she collects from them weekly or monthly. Generally, all the products that she sells are requested through specific orders by her customers. She has been in this business for more than 22 years. It has gone well so far and she has the help of her husband and two daughters. When she started this business, she was full of doubts and insecurities. However, little by little she learned and today she has become an excellent businesswoman. She likes her work because she can create her own source of income and because she also shares this activity with her spouse. She also has enough time to do her work as the lady of the house. She has lots of plans for the future. Among them, she wants to set up a store where she can suitably show off everything that she sells and more comfortably attend to her customers. On this occasion, she will ask for 2,000 soles. She is grateful to all of those who make her loan possible in order to continue with her goals.

Maybe the hard thing is when I meet a new and difficult lesson in computer and networking, but I encourage myself to study harder. \r\n\r\nAfter graduation I\u2019d like to work in a company as a computer administrator\/technician or computer programmer. I want to be a successful person.

My reason to choose this vocational study is I want to be a computer expert, especially a programer. The hardest part for me is the way from hometown to school, because the road is broken and difficult to pass on it. I am pleased because most of the teachers are good and friendly. At this school I joined the student football team. I like play football very much. Having many new friends is something fun for me.\r\n \r\nThe condition of my family is poor. Truly, I am apprehensive about my future and the continuity of my study. My hometown is Menganti village, in Cilacap regency. We stay at a very unpretentious house. All the walls are made from bamboo, and the floor is still soil (no stone, no brick and not coated with cement). Actually it is not proper to be lived in, but we have no other choice. \r\n\r\nThe financial condition of my family is not good. My parents are only poor farmers. Their salary per month is around Rp 500,000. Their money is not sufficient to fulfill the family daily necessities, moreover my school fee. The number of children in my family is three. They are 13 years old (at junior high school), 16 years old (me\/vocational high school) and 25 years old (married).\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to thank to Kiva lenders who are willing to lend me funds.

The hard thing for me is the far distance between my hometown and school. Moreover the transportation vehicles are still rare. \r\n\r\nThank you, Kiva. With the loan given to me from Kiva, I can continue my study. Formerly, I almost dropped out and gave up because my parents cannot pay the school fee. \r\n\r\nThe condition of my house is unpretentious and almost broken. There are many holes in the roof, so when the rain comes, you can see many waterfalls in my house. My father is a laborer and his salary is around Rp. 500,000 a month. The number of children is two. They are my younger sister (13 years old), and me (15 years old). We are students. This loan can improve the financial condition of my family. After graduation, I want to be a computer technician. I want to repair many

Syrga has a secondary education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 23 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Syrga's hard work, today her business contains 10 dairy cows. The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk. In order to further develop her business, Syrga requested a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy calves for subsequent resale at a market at a high price. Syrga plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock

","en":"Ainagul is 46 years old.  She is rasing two children together with her husband.  The spouses started their own business in selling flour in 2003, using a starting capital of 10,000 som (KGS).  Having developed her business and obtained regular customers, Ainagul now has an average monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to their hard work in this business, the spouses were able to buy livestock.  In order to further grow and expand her business, Ainagul requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy flour wholesale for subsequent retail sale to residents.  Ainagul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into increasing her product turnover and saving money for educating her children in a university.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1428986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Dinara has a secondary education and currently works as a cook at a kindergarten. To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 15 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Dinara's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 2 calves and 10 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Dinara requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls in order to increase livestock headcount.

She is a single mother, with 4 children aged 20, 19, 12 and 8 and she lives in her own house. \r\n\r\nLecy's job is selling food at night time, but early in the morning she goes to the market to buy chicken and the freshest vegetables. She then goes back to her house and gets organised so that she has everything prepared, then goes out to the pavement outside her house at night to sell her food. She has a little cart where she prepares the food. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this for 4 years now and she works on her own. What she likes about the work is that it gives her time to carry out her household tasks and she is able to care for her younger children who still need a lot of looking after. The business is going well and she is making almost double her investment. In the future she would like to have a shop selling products and be able to make more income from home. \r\n\r\nTherefore this is Lecy's second loan with Kiva; it is going well for her and she hopes it will stay that way.

The communal bank members carry out a variety of businesses among which are: overall manufacturing, pants sales, blanket weaving, sportswear manufacturing, blanket weaving and fish sales.\r\n\r\nThe loan they\u2019ll take out will benefit small micro businesswomen like Julia.  She indicates that she\u2019s been part of Pro Mujer for two years having joined thanks to an invitation from an institution\u2019s advisor that visited her at home.  She currently has a business manufacturing overalls, a business she learned from her current spouse who was knowledgeable in this particular sewing skill so they decided to open a workshop together where they sell their products.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019ll take out now is to increase capital.  She will buy fabric in street markets in El Alto and after making them will sell them in her sales space.  This way of working allows her to generate income to support her home as possible since she\u2019s in a common law relationship and has four children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers the health training and the credit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1428669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Virginia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Rosa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Rogelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18268,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2056.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2130.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2188.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2248.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2309.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2372.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2436.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2525.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":326.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":344.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":298.35,"local_amount":2056.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2061.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197950},{"amount":309.08,"local_amount":2130.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2135.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153707},{"amount":317.5,"local_amount":2188.68,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2193.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615279},{"amount":326.1,"local_amount":2248.04,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2253.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736219},{"amount":334.96,"local_amount":2309.08,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2314.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641729},{"amount":344.1,"local_amount":2372.08,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2377.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108667},{"amount":353.49,"local_amount":2436.76,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2442.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923749},{"amount":366.42,"local_amount":2525.97,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2531.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144616}],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T18:57:15Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":606569,"name":"Iago","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iago is a 48-year-old married man. He lives in the small village of Vani district with his wife, Marina. Iago has been involved in the animal husbandry business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. Sadly, due to a lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Iago was unable to study for a professional career. Iago has a cow, a pig and two calves. Marina milks the cow every day and produces dairy products for selling. In addition, Iago works hard on the family-owned land, where he grows nut trees. He always has high-quality nuts, which he sells to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\nAs the income is too small, Iago decided to start a nut-trading business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. This startup program, which is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Iago's application was approved under the framework of this program for a loan of 2,000 GEL. With this loan he will purchase a stock of nuts and then resell them at a higher price. This will increase his income and he will be able to expand his husbandry business and generate more income. The new business initiative will give him chance to have financial stability and monthly income.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1429248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

He purchases large quantities of goods from wholesalers and sells them to the retailers. In this way he earns money for his family. He provides all the inventories as per the demand of the retailers. He uses his motorbike to carry the goods and delivers the goods from one place to another.  A few days ago his motorbike collided with a car and he injured his legs.  All his inventories were  scattered on the roads and became useless. \r\n\r\nPhysically Ameena's son is better now but does not have money to buy new inventories to sell. Therefore, Ameena requested a loan for her son so that he can repair his bike and buy new inventories to continue his business.\r\n\r\nAmeena is very thankful to KIVA and to its field partner BRAC

It is composed of eight members and is governed by a board of directors of which Alicia is president. The businesses carried out by the members of the bank are diverse and include braiding and weaving blankets, making sandals, selling dishes, selling lubricants, making tools, selling snacks, and selling food.\r\n\r\nThe loan Alicia will take out will benefit small micro-businesses of which she is a member. She indicates that two years ago she became a member of Pro Mujer after she was invited to join by a friend who is already a member. Currently, she runs an electronics shop. She started this business to support her current partner in the contracts that he had, learning the trade. To expand her services, she began to make independent contracts.\r\n\r\nAlicia is taking this loan out to increase capital. She will buy tools from fairs in the city of El Alto and afterwards she will sell them in her shop. This type of work allows her to generate resources to maintain her home as much as possible since she lives in a common-law marriage and has four children. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the trainings on health and the loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":1428687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":6000,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sicundina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vesna Yraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santusa Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":41340,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5560},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5591.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5742.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5899.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6060.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6225.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6260.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":806.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":811.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":856.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":879.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":903.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":908.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1618.54,"local_amount":11151.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":11183.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153708},{"amount":833.51,"local_amount":5742.92,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5759.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615280},{"amount":856.23,"local_amount":5899.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5916.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736220},{"amount":879.56,"local_amount":6060.16,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6077.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641730},{"amount":903.58,"local_amount":6225.64,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6243.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108668},{"amount":908.58,"local_amount":6260.12,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6277.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923750}],"funded_date":"2013-10-14T03:39:22Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T12:50:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Eddy","image":1377564}},{"id":606262,"name":"Estrellas Celestes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cESTRELLAS CELESTES\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el cuarto ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Collpani, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Isabel es la Presidenta.

","en":"Zayniddin is an energetic 49-year-old with a lust for life who is quite glad to have the family he does.  He is married with 4 kids, and is happy to have so many children.  He has 3 daughters and one son.  His first daughter married after graduating from college; his second daughter is studying at a technological university; and his third daughter has enrolled in a university which specializes in medicine.  Meanwhile, his long-awaited son, born after all his daughters, is studying in secondary school.  \r\n\r\nZayniddin works in a government-owned business.  His spouse has a university education in a medical field, and works at the local hospital as well as in home health, where she sets up IV-bags and performs injections.  Her work brings in much-needed money for the family; as the children have grown up, and the family's monetary needs have increased, she is a big help to Zayniddin.  In this year in particular, he has had financial difficulties due to his third daughter starting college, in addition to having to pay for his second daughter's tuition for the year.  Zayniddin always strives to do whatever possible to provide for his children and fulfill their desires; at the moment, though, it looks as if it will be difficult to pay for his second daughter's education.  Thus, Zayniddin has turned to Arvand, hoping to receive a loan to pay for her tuition, and would like to thank Arvand in advance for their financial

","en":"Urmatkan is 41 years old, a widow, and has three sons and two daughters. After her husband's death, she became the sole breadwinner for the family. Urmatkan was searching for a source of income for her family, and thereby began selling groceries. She started her business with 1,000 KGS in 1995. She rents her grocery shop. Through her hard work, Urmatkan was able to develop and expand her product line. Her business brings in about 15,000 KGS per month, which pays for all of the food and household needs of the family. The income generated by her business has allowed Urmatkan to expand her business. In order to further develop her business, Urmatkan approached the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 130,000 KGS to buy wholesale food products for resale. The income from the loan will help Urmatkan increase sales in her grocery store. The resulting profit will help her raise and educate her children well.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1429969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy food for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chongara village, Batken region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.57,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urmatkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":9203},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":9472},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":9748},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":10032},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":10325},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":10626},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":10936},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":11255},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":11583},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":11921},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12269},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12630}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":187.6,"local_amount":9203,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":9253.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777213},{"amount":391.79,"local_amount":19220,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":19325.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427061},{"amount":414.97,"local_amount":20357,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20468.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553107},{"amount":215.65,"local_amount":10626,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":10684.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.96,"payment_id":459019568},{"amount":222.92,"local_amount":10936,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":10996.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053315},{"amount":229.43,"local_amount":11255,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":11316.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749468},{"amount":236.12,"local_amount":11583,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11646.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178194},{"amount":243,"local_amount":11921,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":11986.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462818},{"amount":250.1,"local_amount":12269,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12336.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529946841},{"amount":254.85,"local_amount":12630,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":12699.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.61,"payment_id":542440176}],"funded_date":"2013-10-14T19:13:46Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":606613,"name":"Marlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlene is 53 years old and married, with seven children.\r\n\r\nMarlene works hard to provide for her family.

She now intends to expand her capital.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019ll take out now is to increase capital.  She will buy vicu\u00f1a wool from wholesale stores in the city of La Paz and once made will sell to the firm to order.  This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her home as possible since she\u2019s in a common law relationship and has four children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers the health area because it has a medical office.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3750,"image":{"id":1428799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy vicu\u00f1a wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T21:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T21:40:01Z","loan_amount":3750,"lender_count":129,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestino\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelia Ang\u00e9lica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana Rosa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25864,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2408.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3002.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3084.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3168.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3254.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3343.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3434.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4169.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":349.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":459.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":484.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":497.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":604.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":349.16,"local_amount":2408.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2412.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153710},{"amount":435.26,"local_amount":3002.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3007.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615282},{"amount":447.2,"local_amount":3084.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3089.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736222},{"amount":459.34,"local_amount":3168.08,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3173.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641732},{"amount":471.84,"local_amount":3254.32,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3260.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108670},{"amount":484.79,"local_amount":3343.64,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3349.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923752},{"amount":1102.41,"local_amount":7603.4,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":7617.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144618}],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T13:29:19Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":608736,"name":"Miguel Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miguel es un hombre de 21 a\u00f1os, es soltero, vive en la ciudad de Pisco con sus padres y hermanos, el es muy trabajador, entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por salir adelante;

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

She is married and has two children aged 20 and 17. Many years ago, she established her grocery store business.  Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid four loans from Kiva partner Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy grocery goods for her business.  In the future, Shanti plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasal, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.

Peter enjoys his work and fishing with friends.  Peter is an all-around handyman.  He does not fear any type of job.  Recently, he decided to make repairs on his house, specifically, to hang drywall on walls and the ceiling, and to update the floor with high quality laminate.  To achieve this, he needs 20,000 hryvni to purchase construction materials.  Peter is planning to give the two renovated rooms to his daughter, who is getting married soon.

She lives in a one-bedroom apartment which is poorly heated and constantly feels \"damp\".\n\nFor a long time now, Nataliya has been dreaming about installing an individual heating system in her apartment, so that she will finally stop feeling like she is freezing during the cold season.

Throughout his entire productive life, Jes\u00fas worked in the construction field, but due to the unstable labor market and his age he decided to become independent.  With some savings he had on hand, he decided to start his own business.  Jes\u00fas has a grocery store where he offers cleaning products, grains, pastas, dairy products, and many other household products.  He has the help of his young daughter and they work every day from 7:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M.  In order to supplement his family\u2019s earnings, Jes\u00fas also performs construction jobs on a sporadic basis.  During these moments, his family helps with managing the business.  \r\n\r\nJes\u00fas says that his main challenge is the lack of operating capital, which limits his inventory and results in lost sales because he lacks products.  Nonetheless, this does not discourage him.  On the contrary, he is motivated to look for ways to move forward with his business.  For this reason, Jes\u00fas is requesting a loan so that he can buy merchandise in bulk (grains, pastas, pastries, sodas, cold cuts, dairy products, and other items).  This will enable him to have a wider variety of products on hand that he can offer to his customers.  As a result, he will be able to improve his sales and his income so that he can continue covering basic household needs.  \r\n\r\nJes\u00fas dreams of expanding his store, stocking his business with more products, and increasing his clientele.

She asks for the loan in order to set up a beauty salon at her house, which she would manage with her daughter and which would help her sell her wares. The daughter has experience in being a beautician but lacks the capital to buy the chair and the shampoo station.

She has lived in Mwembe B for 37 years with her husband and 6 children.\n\nThe community of Mwembe B village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Mwembe B\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination.  \n\nIn Mwembe B, 17 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Jesicah has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are also four other promoters that are part of this group loan: Monicah, two Kennedys, and Gladys. Each promoter will be responsible for encouraging people to treat their water using the dispenser, and each of their communities will have access to safe water using a portion of this loan.\n\nJessicah's village, Mwembe B, along with Monicah's, Gladys' and the Kennedys' villages need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispensers. Jesicah believes that the dispenser will help her community fight waterborne diseases for a healthier lifestyle.

His mother milks the cows every day and produces cheese for selling. In addition, his mother sells flowers.\r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, George was unable to study a professional career. George decided to start his own business, and seek credit among local financial institutions; his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe startup program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application for a loan of $5,000 to build a greenhouse was approved under the framework of this program. \r\n\r\nHe will purchase the building materials, and tomato and cucumber seeds. As the greenhouse is built, he will sow vegetables and will sell the harvest at a good price. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative will give him chance to have financial stability and a monthly

By learning history, I know the history of my nation and also other nations around the world. I have a little trouble about the way to school and to go home. If I go home rather late, it\u2019s hard to find public transportation so I walk instead. My hometown is far from school but I have no choice. Having new friends and teachers makes me glad. \r\n\r\nAs a Moslem, I spend my spare time learing more about the Qur\u2019an and other knowledge about Islam. I can manage my time well, for study and extra-curricular activities. We rent a house because we have not had our own house yet. I usually go to school on foot, but if I wake up late, I go by bus. I am afraid the gate of my school will be closed. \r\n\r\nTo KIVA lenders, I am very grateful. Your help is useful for me. I live in Jeruklegi Wetan Village, Jeruklegi Subdistrict, Cilacap Regency, Mid Java Province, Indonesia. The condition of my village is not modern, The road is mud and soil, with many trees and hilly. My parents earn money from their small business. Their salary is not fixed; it is about Rp. 700,000\/month.\r\n\r\n The number of children in my family is three. They are: me \/ the oldest ( 15 years old ), Rizal ( 9 years old ), and Lutfi ( 4 years old ). Only me and my younger brother,  Rizal, are students. With this loan I can lighten the financial burden of my family. In this school, I learn accounting as my major. To be a good and successful accountant is my dream. It is a pleasure for me to learn new knowledge that I haven\u2019t learned before.

Besides, Ineza has a dairy cow and sells cheese products locally. Unfortunately, the existing income is not enough to make ends meet for the family.

The Startup Program gives vulnerable poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of 3,600 GEL, she will purchase second-hand clothing and shoes at wholesale prices and sell it in her community. She will set up a store and offer her customers a wide assortment and well-priced products. Ineza has got the several useful recommendations from a relative who is running the same business and hopes her project will be lucrative. She plans to develop her trading business gradually.

She sells from morning to afternoon time six days of the week. She has a regular group of customers that visit her table for new merchandise among her used clothes. She gives goods on credit to some customers and collects the money later; most interestingly she makes her own money. \r\n\r\nTheresa has requested a loan to purchase more used clothes. In the future, she wants to be her own boss and wants her children to live a good life.

He lives with his wife, parents, two brothers, a daughter-in-law and his grandfather. His grandfather is provided with a retirement pension. Zviad and his brother work at a local petrol station and get a small monthly income. The family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have a vineyard and produce and sell wine. They work hard and always have high quality wine, which is sold to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\n As the family has only seasonal income, Zviad decided to start his own business and seek for credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 2500 Gel.\r\n\r\n With the received credit, Zviad will build a greenhouse.

Hovhannes has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. So this loan will be a great support for Hovhannes to be able to purchase leather and other materials for tailoring shoes. Thus, he will be able to earn income and cover his family's living expenses. \r\n\r\nHovhannes waits for lenders'

The profits from the potatoes he produces will be used to help in providing family needs.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

It is composed of members who run small businesses as well as practice farming.\r\nTeresa, the group chair (far left in the photo) is a small-scale farmer who grows maize, sorghum and millet. She runs a hardware store whose income contributes to the family needs such as food, school fees and taking care of their very poor neighbors. She joined Big Vision group early last year to empower her day-to-day life and business through affordable credit and to access solar lamps and cook stoves which proves efficient in her area since they save on fuel costs. Teresa had previously accessed her first loan with the group which she used to start up the business and has successfully repaid the loan.\r\nThis year, she sold her farm produce at good prices and used the money to meet the family\u2019s basic needs. Income from her hardware business paid school fees for her two children in high school. After repaying the first loan, she came up with the idea of stocking the business with solar lamps and energy-saving cook stoves. She shared the idea with her fellow members who are also business people and they were ready to adapt the idea as well,  having seen the opportunity that is presented by the scarcity of fuel for cooking and lighting in their region.This will lead to more income for them and their families. They opted for a loan from VEP to stock their businesses. Profits will be used to repay the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5725,"image":{"id":1429459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy

Her family consists of her husband and two sons (the youngest of them is a school-age boy).  Anahit\u2019s older son works in the private sector; however, the salary he gets there is not enough to meet the family\u2019s daily needs. \r\n\r\nThe family's most important source of income is its agricultural business. Anahit is particularly engaged in breeding sheep, wheat cultivation, alfalfa cultivation, and cultivation of cabbage and watermelons. Her family members support her a lot in selling the agro products at the local market. \r\n\r\nAs the family\u2019s daily expenses grow with time, they now need to enlarge their agribusiness a little bit.  A loan of US$ 3,000 will be a huge support to them.  It will enable them to purchase five steers and to pay for the harvesting of the wheat, as well as to purchase wheat seeds. \r\n\r\nThey will be grateful to all the lenders for helping them to gather the needed amount of loan for maintaining and enlarging their
