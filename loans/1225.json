For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

With biogas, Sammy would save money on lighting and cooking.

With a size 12m3 biogas plant, he will easily commercialize it and supply energy to his neighbors, at a cost. Hence, he will be in a better position to repay the loan.

Only three of them are attending school. \r\n\r\nFor five years now she has been selling charcoal. She learned how to do this business from her mother and the best part of her work is that it keeps her busy. She sells for six days a week, spending 10 hours each day.  She mostly uses taxis to get her goods to her shop. She is glad today that she is independent. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase charcoal by bags to increase her sales.

hogar desde que su esposo falleci\u00f3 hace alg\u00fan tiempo. Desde hace 20 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de comidas r\u00e1pidas, inicialmente colabor\u00e1ndole a su madre a prepararlas, as\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 gran parte de lo que hoy sabe y, desde hace 2 a\u00f1os inici\u00f3 su propio negocio vendiendo patacones, chuzos y comidas r\u00e1pidas en general, cuenta con el apoyo de una de sus hijas y, con las ganancias que obtiene  lleva el sustento a su hogar y solventa los gastos b\u00e1sicos de la familia. Ella trabaja en el negocio de Viernes a Domingo y los dem\u00e1s d\u00edas de la semana alterna esta actividad trabajando como empleada de oficios varios en diferentes casas, as\u00ed complementa la entrada de dinero al hogar. Las ventas en el negocio en algunos momentos se han visto afectadas porque en el barrio donde reside se presentan algunos problemas de orden p\u00fablico y enfrentamientos entre bandas criminales del sector, sin embargo, Zulima no se desanima, por el contrario se caracteriza por ser una mujer din\u00e1mica, alegre y emprendedora, le gusta lo que hace ya que con su trabajo ha logrado sacar adelante a sus hijas, quienes son el motor principal de su vida. Esto la motiva a solicitar el ciclo de cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de un carro de comidas r\u00e1pidas y surtido en general (salsas, carnes fr\u00edas, panes, gaseosas), esto le permitir\u00e1 ampliar su capacidad instalada con la que podr\u00e1 dejar de preparar los alimentos en la cocina de su casa y, adem\u00e1s podr\u00e1 tener disponibilidad de insumos suficientes para satisfacer los diversos gustos de los comensales. Esto se reflejar\u00e1 en el aumento de las ventas y los ingresos, con los cuales pretende cumplir el sue\u00f1o de adquirir un local propio en un futuro a mediano plazo, en el que pueda ofrecer mayor variedad de productos y sus clientes puedan estar m\u00e1s c\u00f3modos, adem\u00e1s desea generar empleo; de esta manera podr\u00e1 mejorar las condiciones de vida y disfrutar de un mejor bienestar al lado de sus hijas.  ","en":"Zulima, 44, is mother of two daughters and has been head of household since her husband died some time ago.  She\u2019s sold fast-food for the last 20 years.  Initially her mother helped her make it and that\u2019s how she learned most of what she knows today.  For the last two years she\u2019s been in business for herself selling fried banana chips, meat kebabs and fast-food in general.  One of her daughters helps her and she uses profits earned to support her home and cover basic family expenses.  She works in her business Friday to Sunday and the other days of the week works as a domestic employee in various houses; this is how she adds to her household income. \r\n\r\nSales in her business have been somewhat affected lately because her neighborhood has had some public order problems and clashes between rival criminal gangs in the area.  Nevertheless, Zulima does not become discouraged.  On the contrary, she\u2019s known to be dynamic, cheerful and enterprising.  She likes what she does because she\u2019s succeeded in raising her daughters, who are her main priority, thanks to her work.\r\n\r\nThis has motivated her to request a loan cycle to buy a fast-food cart and to stock up on supplies (sauces, cold cuts, bread, soft-drinks) which will make it possible for her to increase her capacity and to be able to stop producing the food in her home kitchen.  She will also have sufficient amounts of the necessary ingredients on hand to meet the various tastes of her diners.\r\n\r\nThis will be reflected in higher sales and income that she intends to use to reach her dream of acquiring a locale of her own in the future medium run so that she can offer greater variety of products and her customers can be more comfortable.  Also, she\u2019d like to generate employment and be able to improve her living conditions and to enjoy better well-being in company of her daughters.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1434223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married, with two children, ages 4 years and 10 years. Her older child is currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Abiabatu established her home-products business. She began her business because she wanted a source of income to support her family. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is sometimes the flow of customers is very slow.\r\n\r\nAbiabatu requires a loan in order to buy cups, food containers, and plates for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her standard of living. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Abiabatu plans to open a big shop.

These women are looking forward to the business education classes and the monthly visits from the Namaste Business Advisor who will help them write and implement their business plan.  They live and work in San Juan Alotenango, a small town not far from the city of Antigua.\n\nWendy Maribel, in the center of the photo, has had a small store for eight years.  She is married to a policeman who works in the city and only comes home for a few days every two weeks.  She has a daughter not yet in school, and she has one employee who helps her with childcare and with the store.  She plans to use her loan to buy personal care products that she does not currently carry, such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and toothbrushes.  She is optimistic that when she learns how to handle her inventory and control her sales and expenses that she will be able to increase her profit and grow her business.\n\nCurrently, Wendy Maribel works 224 hours per month and has profits of approximately $139 US.  She anticipates that with her new products and her new knowledge, she will be able to increase her profits during the nine months of this program by more than 100%.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1434214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She's requesting a loan to cover her expenses.  This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Ana Diomaira.  I'm 19 years old.  I was born in Guacao, La Vega, and grew up and live in Jamo, La Vega.  I have two siblings and I'm single and have no children.  My mother's a homemaker and my father's an independent worker.\r\n\r\nI study nursing at the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Tecnol\u00f3gica del Cibao (UCATECI).  I love it because I want to immerse myself in the field of health and the possibility of curing other people.  I took 90% of the required courses in high school, including ecology, environmental studies, Dominican history, introduction to computer science, professional ethics, etc.\r\n\r\nI need the loan for the following reasons: low economic resources, the inability of my parents to cover the household needs, and because I want to secure the stability of my educational program.  If I were not to receive this loan, I would be in a big predicament and my possibilities for advancement would be reduced.  I'd try to find a solution, however, and not stay at a standstill permanently.\r\n\r\nMy academic goals are to educate myself deeply in everything that is nursing so I can make the most of the knowledge I acquire in my program.  My family goals, on the other hand, are to contribute to my family's health through the resources I acquire and through my potential in the health field.  Among my personal goals are to grow professionally and to always be ready when it comes time to help any patient, regardless of race, gender, and social status.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing this program, I would think about putting into practice all my acquired knowledge to achieve my goals.  I would be grateful to this program for what I've learned because I'm planning to study medicine after this.  Finally, I want to work as a nurse while I educate myself more in the field of medical-surgical care.\r\n\r\nNot having anything more to say I'll take my leave, hoping you'll understand this application in the nicest possible way.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1434114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

She gladly works in the field from early morning until late at night. She is planning to expand her business, but she hasn't got money to buy seeds and fertilizer. She is renovating her home because it is quite old and in poor condition.

After the death of her husband, she was left alone to raise three children and to run her homestead. Gulbara has a high school education. As a main source of income for her family, Gulbara is engaged in raising livestock, having started 24 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 1,000 som KGS. Thanks to Gulbara's hard work, she today has on her homestead: two dairy cows and 20 sheep. Monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her homestead, Gulbara turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow with calf. \r\n\r\nGulbara plans to invest income from the loan to further increase the count of domestic animals, and plans to save resources to put on a wedding celebration for her son.

She has a professional degree, but the main source of income for the family is raising livestock. Guljainat has stared the livestock business 10 years ago with 12,000 som (KGS). Due to her hard and persistent work they now own 2 milk cows, 5 sheep and a horse. The monthly income from the herd is 6,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her business Guljainat has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 20,000 som (KGA). She plans to use this loan to buy more sheep. Guljainat will invest the profits from this venture back into her livestock business and also hopes to eventually save enough money to buy her family a car."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1431115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kommunizm village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T20:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T20:20:10Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guljainat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1457},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1499},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1588},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1635},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1682},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1731},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1834},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1887},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1946}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.05,"local_amount":2873,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3015.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777215},{"amount":31.85,"local_amount":1499,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1573.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427063},{"amount":66.53,"local_amount":3131,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3286.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553109},{"amount":34.64,"local_amount":1635,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.1,"payment_id":459019570},{"amount":35.76,"local_amount":1682,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1765.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053317},{"amount":36.78,"local_amount":1731,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1817.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749470},{"amount":0.38,"local_amount":18.04,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":18.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178196},{"amount":76.46,"local_amount":3597.96,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3777,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462820},{"amount":40.1,"local_amount":1887,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1980.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529946843},{"amount":41,"local_amount":1946,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.35,"payment_id":542440177}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T22:26:12Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":606896,"name":"Korpo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Korpo lives at Sinkor in Montserrado County, where the capital city of Liberia is located.

","en":"Nabi is a 48 year old man with wife and three children. He works for a canning factory which produces canned fruits and vegetables. Nabi is one of the truck drivers at the factory who transports the final products in and out of town. Nabi's wife is a seamstress who makes national Tajik dresses from home. Nabi's son dreams of becoming a highly qualified professional in finance. He is now attending the university for the second year, but still lives with his parents. Nabi and his wife work hard but their combined income is not sufficient to pay the university's tuition. For this reason Nabi wants to take out a loan so that he can pay for his son's education.

She is married and has three children between the ages of 9 and 21 years. Her children are currently attending school. In 2009, Tigidankay established her bread business. She began her business because she wanted to get a source of income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is sometimes, the purchasing power of customers is very low.\r\n\r\nTigidanky requires a loan, in order to purchase flour and sugar. She will use those ingredients to prepare her bread to sell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her standard of living. In the future, Tigidanky plans to open a big provisions shop. She thanks you for your

on cloth or on alabaster. They are all different, but one thing unites them: Freedom of expression. One of these people is Abdukarim. He lives in the Qurgan-Tube region. He creates his paintings though engraving them on the sides of the national crib, which he produces himself, with his own hands.\r\n\r\nAbdukarim is a master in his work. His engravings are masterpieces of art. Abdukarim loves his work and strives for each subsequent piece of work being better than the previous. To create and engrave cribs is very hard work, but Abdukarim loves his work so much that he doesn't notice that time flies. Currently Abdukarim has used up all his wood resources and he urgently needs to replenish them. \r\n\r\nAbdukarim takes a loan to purchase wood. He hopes that the money received is enough to purchase material, and that he again can return to his beloved

","en":"Ranogul is 51 years old. She was born in Vahdat which is located in south-western Tajikistan. Ranogul lives with her son and daughter, while her husband is a migrant worker in Russia. Even though he is far away, Ranogul's husband never forgets about his family and he loves them all dearly: his beautiful daughter - mother's helper, his son - the man of the house and his beautiful wife who waits for him at home. While Ranogul's husband is away, she tries her best to provide her children with all the necessities. Ranogul works in a fashion studio as a seamstress. She started working in this area when she turned 40 years old. Ranogul can sew, draft and design new patterns, and her clothes make others happy. The best reward for Ranogul is to see the excited expressions on the faces of her clients when they try on her designs.  Ranogul has been working as a seamstress and fashion designer for 11 years. She still takes her orders through the fashion studio, but wants to also be able to work at home, so that she can be close to her children. The sewing machine that Ranogul uses in the studio belongs to the studio. So that she can buy her own sewing machine and all the accessories and be able to continue working while home Ranogul needs money, but all her income is spent on her family. That is why Ranogul decided to take out this loan. She wants to work and better provide for her children and also be near

He is 40 years old. For the last five years Boturjon has worked as a manager of the local school. However, the main source of income is Boturjon's livestock business. In Tajikistan the salaries of school teachers and school staff are miniscule. His salary as a manger would not allow Boturjon to feed his large family - his aging parents, his stay-at-home wife and four young children. Most of Boturjon's time is spent with his livestock, taking care of the cows, goats and baby lambs. He has learned to take good care of his animals from his father and grandfather and has been using those lessons for 25 years. He is still thanks full to his elders for the knowledge. Boturjon owns only a few heads of cattle and wants to breed them, so he has decided to take out this loan. This loan will allow Boturjon to not only take care of baby lambs but also raise baby calves.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1430137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Yusuf has an electronics store, where he used to sell electronics. Currently he and his brother want to reestablish this business. They decided to sell mobile phones and their accessories. His craving to know everything new and the latest devices in the world of electronics and technology pushed him to this step. \r\n\r\nYusuf would like to bring mobile phones and accessories for this new technology from Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, so that his small region, Vose, moves along and become \"mobilized\". With this dream and hope they went to Humo and requested a loan. Yusuf hopes that he will again be able to establish his business and make mobile communication easily available to the residents of the

married, and has four kids. She has a high school education and provides the main source of income for her family. Ainur raises farm animals, which she began doing 10 years ago when she bought cattle for 15,000 som.

She has a professional degree but makes her living raising livestock. She started five years ago with 10,000 som (KGS) and now owns two milk cows and five sheep. The milk and meat sales allow Boldu to earn 5,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to buy another cow she has turned to the micro-lending bank \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS). In the future Boldu will use the profits to buy more animals as well as save money to build a new house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1431215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Shoro village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T21:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T21:40:18Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.53,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boldu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2832},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2915},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3087},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3177},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3270},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3366},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3464},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3565},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3669},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3776},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3879}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.41,"local_amount":2832,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2872.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777218},{"amount":122,"local_amount":5915,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5999.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427066},{"amount":129.19,"local_amount":6264,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6353.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553111},{"amount":66.95,"local_amount":3270,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3316.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.49,"payment_id":459019572},{"amount":69.43,"local_amount":3366,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3414.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053319},{"amount":71.44,"local_amount":3464,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3513.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749472},{"amount":73.53,"local_amount":3565,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3616.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178198},{"amount":75.68,"local_amount":3669,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3721.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462822},{"amount":77.88,"local_amount":3776,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3830.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529946845},{"amount":78.96,"local_amount":3879,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3934.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.04,"payment_id":542440179}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T13:51:16Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":606933,"name":"Fernando Jhonnathan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fernando dreams of working in the hospitality industry, but without a degree, he knows it may never be possible.

five children together with her husband. Zamira has secondary education. As a main income for her family, Zamira works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zamira's persistent work, her farm currently has one horse and also a plot of land of the size of 0.40 hectares, on which she every year grows onions, sweet corn and potatoes to sell. The monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zamira turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS), to purchase sheep to fatten and consequently sell at the market at a higher price. Zamira plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals and plans to save money for building a new barn for the livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1431906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aravan village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T21:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T21:40:18Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":41.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.85,"local_amount":5219.4,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5294.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.8,"payment_id":459019574},{"amount":97.31,"local_amount":4780.6,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4849.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.29,"payment_id":542440181},{"amount":487.65,"local_amount":25175.4,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25535.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":31.59,"payment_id":561578671},{"amount":58.1,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3042.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.77,"payment_id":579489383},{"amount":34,"local_amount":1824.6,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1850.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.64,"payment_id":595436680}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T03:15:36Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":609460,"name":"Isabel Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isabel es madre de 2 hijos en edades e 17 a 30 a\u00f1os, con quienes habita en un municipio a orillas del mar caribe.

She lives with them in a town on the shore of the Caribbean. In 1995, when she accompanied a friend to buy varied merchandise to sell in another department of the Colombian Caribbean, she realized that it was a very good business and she started to sell groceries directly to the residents of the town where she lives. She does her business now on credit every day from 8 in the morning until 6 i the evening. She pays for her merchandise upfront in granaries and stores and warehouses in the department of  La Guajira in northern Colombia. Her main customers are people she knows and retirees whom she has won over little by little, and with whom she has been able to grow her business. Her goal for the future is to open her locale to the public and remodel her store. Her biggest challenge is increasing sales.

of two sons and a faithful wife. She lives in Konibodom, a town with an interesting culture, ancient traditions and delicious flatbreads. It is impossible to just walk past the stalls full of hot, golden, beautifully shaped Konibodom flatbreads - you really have to envy the town's residents. Gulbahor is one of the saleswomen of these famous bread masterpieces. She has been selling for five years. Her husband and her sons are helping her at the market stall. Gulbahor has many clients and not just a few regulars. Her goods are in great demand and frequently sell out, so that the latecomers miss their chance to try her Konibodom flatbreads. Gulbahor wants to take out this loan so that she can buy larger batches of flatbreads from the bakers. No-one doubts that this bread venture will be successful but Gulbahor wants to thank all of you in

She has a college degree, but makes her living raising livestock. She started 20 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS) and now owns five milk cows. The monthly profits from milk sales are 8,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her business Akkyz has turned to micro-finance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Parnters\" for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to buy sheep. Akkyz plans to purchase more animals in the future and also save enough money to build a new house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1431234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Shoro village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-18T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-18T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.17,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akkyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2124},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2186},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2315},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2383},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2524},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2597},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2673},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2751},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2831},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2914}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.25,"local_amount":2124,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2176.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777219},{"amount":92.42,"local_amount":4436,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4544.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427067},{"amount":97.88,"local_amount":4698,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4813.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553112},{"amount":50.7,"local_amount":2452,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.38,"payment_id":459019573},{"amount":52.58,"local_amount":2524,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2585.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053320},{"amount":54.1,"local_amount":2597,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2660.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749473},{"amount":55.69,"local_amount":2673,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2738.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178199},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":2751,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2818.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462823},{"amount":58.98,"local_amount":2831,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2900.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529946846},{"amount":59.92,"local_amount":2914,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2985.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.79,"payment_id":542440180}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T16:35:19Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:22:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":607062,"name":"Mary Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jane is 33 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

Raising the funds to start her own business was not easy. She saved what she could out of every paycheck she received to be able to purchase the equipment she would need. Three years later, and with about $60,000 in equipment, she is finally ready to open. She even used the money she got back from her tax returns to pay the down payment for the caf\u00e9\u2019s lease and pay the first few months rent. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a $5,000 Kiva loan, the only amount she has not been able to cover herself, to purchase inventory and pay for inspection and permit costs. With the $5,000 from Kiva, she will finally be able to open the doors of her beloved little caf\u00e9 on Van Nuys and Victory

Now she is living and is happy because she has a good and hardworking husband and wonderful children. \r\n\r\nTo live well in the rural areas requires constant work. Therefore, Sanavar and her husband are constantly busy with some sort of work which brings a good income to the family. Sanavar herself works on a group farm and is involved in sewing all kinds of crops. Her husband works as a mechanic and has his own tractor. Similarly, in order to have more income, Sanavar and her husband are engaged in the fattening and resale of cattle. Today she has about ten heads of cattle. Daily, Sanavar milks the cows and sells 15 liters. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Sanavar wishes to increase the number of her livestock in order to get more profit and to stock up on essential products and items for the winter. She therefore turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to buy cattle.

She lives on her own without her husband and has two children in her care. Sabohat lives in a small rural village. She works as a teacher in a local school. But living on a teacher's salary is very difficult and she lacks the money for even basic food. Her children need good nutrition to grow healthy and developed. Sabohat therefore is doing everything possible to somehow find more income for a decent living. \r\n\r\nMost recently, she decided to start her own business which will bring her a good steady income. And as a hardworking woman, her choice stopped on raising livestock and horticulture, because from childhood she knows the ins and outs of these activities. But in order to start this business, she needs some amount of money that she does not currently have. She decided therefore to take a loan to start a business. She will purchase small calves, then grow them and sell the meat and milk from the grown cattle. \r\n\r\nIn this way, she will have a steady income that will help her to improve her quality of life. To obtain a loan to buy cattle, Sabohat turned to Arvand.

It was he who taught him animal husbandry. His grandfather was a shepherd and always took Hikmatullo with him when he was still young.

Fatkhullo has been working in a grocery store for three years. Fatkhullo markets and sells products himself. In his store, one can find all the products, including cookies, muffins, candy, butter, condensed milk, drinks, juice, soda, preserved meats, and much more. Fatkhullo is trying to keep the shelves from ever being empty so that customers can buy all the necessities. To support this arrangement, he is helped by his family. \r\n\r\nFatkhullo opened his store three years ago and has never regretted it.

The house they live in was built last year. Due to a lack of capital, they haven't finished the roof. So she is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to purchase shingles and planks.

She has a store where she sells food, groceries, grains, vegetables, dairy products, drinks and basic household goods. Liliana has 13 years of experience in this business, which she started in 2000 after seeing the need for it in her community. She started selling everyday items that people buy on a regular basis, in the sizes and quantities that her customers wanted.  \r\n\r\nLiliana\u2019s intuition was very good, and she quickly began to make a profit. She started by selling rice, panela [unrefined whole cane sugar], vegetables, meat and cold drinks. Now she continues with her business, selling in both cash and on credit from 6 in the morning until 9 at night. To offer her customers good prices, Liliana says that she buys in cash from wholesalers and granaries that give her good discounts. She then passes the savings on to her customers. \r\n\r\nLiliana hopes to increase her sales so that she can help her children to become professionals. She wants to win her customer\u2019s loyalty by offering them competitive prices and excellent service. \r\n\r\nLiliana is requesting her first loan from Kiva and the field partner to buy groceries, vegetables, drinks and toiletries for her store. She says that her goal in life is to see her two children, ages 21 and 14, receive a university education, so that they will realize their full potential to be successful.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1434302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries, vegetables, drinks and toiletries for her store.

Her husband has been running a small vegetable shop for many years in a nearby town and earning a reasonable income. \r\n\r\nTo grow his business, he is thinking of selling fruits in the evening so that he can increase his net income. With the passage of time, the inflation has been increasing day by day, but the sources of income remain constant. To increase his income, he wants to turn his enterprise towards progress, but for the purchase of fruits, he does not have a sufficient amount. He tried to borrow some money from his friends and relatives, but nobody helped him. Therefore, Shahnaz requested a loan for her husband so that her husband would be able to buy additional fruits to resell during the evening.

She lives in a common-law marriage with her partner. At one time her family suffered through a financially difficult period when she was unemployed and her partner\u2019s salary was not enough to cover household expenses.  So Adelaida decided to start her own business in order to generate income for her household and set up a general store about a year ago. Even though she had no experience, she was driven by her entrepreneurial spirit and used the trial and error method of running her store. In her store she offers paper goods, personal hygiene items, and cosmetics, and she also has three computers which she uses to provide an Internet caf\u00e9 service. She has thus been able to generate sufficient revenue to continue to meet her household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to invest in a variety of items at wholesale prices (notebooks, pencils, gift bags, cosmetics, and hygiene products, amongst others), and also to maintain her computers and expand the memory on them. This will allow her to provide better service to her customers because the computers will run faster and she will have more products available to meet their needs. This will result in an increase in her daily income allowing her to further organize and firmly establish her business.  She hopes that in the near future she can stabilize her finances and provide her children with better living conditions, a better education, and a better sense of well-being.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1434364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives in a nuclear family with her husband and children in the Bagadadji neighborhood of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of Mali.) Not having attended school for social reasons, due to being in a traditional Dogon family, she began conducting her small business independently at an early age. She has been in business for 25 years and enjoys a large customer base and has the benefit of extensive experience.\r\n\r\nFatoumata's strength in her business is due to the quality of her Gamiaka rice, highly popular with consumers. In addition, she often receives orders from her neighbors and also from Bamako where she has a large customer base. In the hope of increasing her business funds in order to meet her customers' needs, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso. Fatoumata has been in a partnership with them for 48 months, during which time her 2 group loans and 2 individual loans have been fully repaid.\r\n\r\nFatoumata is on her 3rd individual loan which she plans to use to purchase 1 ton of rice. She stocks up in Niono, and sells for cash and credit to a customer base made up mostly of women. Fatoumata hopes to earn a monthly profit of 70,000 francs CFA, which she will use to pay back her loan and to help her husband care for the family's expenses.

Some fun things for me are having many friends and studying with friendly teachers. \r\n\r\nI would like to thank the Kiva program. My family was helped, so I can continue my study in spite of my family being poor. \r\n\r\nMy hometown is Brebeg village, Jeruklegi subdistrict, Cilacap Regency, Mid Java Province, Indonesia. The roads around my village are bad, with many holes, muddy and rocky. It\u2019s difficult to pass by. My parents are farmers. Their salary is low and not enough to fulfill the needs of us. Their salary is around Rp. (Rupiah) 200,000 per month. \r\n\r\nThe number of children in my family are six. They are Lasimin (35 years old), Lasinah (33 years old), Haryati (29 years old), Turiman (26 years old), Endang Susiati (19 years old), and me (16 years old). I am the only child who is studying at school. With this loan, I can go to school again, and I hope I can reach my dream. My family is very grateful to Kiva.\r\n\r\nIn this school, I will study about accounting lessons. I want to get a job as an accountant and can help my parents.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1429231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

So it happened that, in the absence of competition, he started to rent out washing machines in his own neighborhood. His neighborhood is located in the municipality of Soledad, 15 minutes away from the main city where he lives with his spouse and two children, aged 3 and 5. \r\n\r\nAlfredo's clients call him by telephone to request his rental washing machine service, and he brings the washing machines to each family's residence where he is paid by the hour.

With her situation, Marfina did not stop believing that someday she would be able to overcome these trials.\r\n\r\nMarfina is grateful because her three children finished their college education and have degrees. All of them are now working abroad in accordance with their own profession. Marfina admits that she receives remittances from her children but she doesn\u2019t want to rely on them. Instead, she wants to have her own source of income for which she can gain profit. Marfina requests a loan of PHP 17,000 to buy shampoo, toothpaste, conditioner and seasonings.

Gracias a ello, vio en este campo una oportunidad de negocio rentable, por lo que decidi\u00f3 iniciar su propio taller de confecci\u00f3n el cual se encuentra ubicado en la casa donde reside; desde all\u00ed presta el servicio a terceros, hace trabajos y arreglos de modister\u00eda y adem\u00e1s confecciona sobre medida algunas prendas que solicitan sus vecinos. En la actualidad tiene contrato con una gran empresa a quien le produce las bolsas de empaque para lo cual cuenta con el apoyo de 3 personas que le colaboran con la terminaci\u00f3n de este producto. Liliam es una mujer activa, emprendedora, pujante y perseverante, se motiva a solicitar el cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de una m\u00e1quina industrial plana, con la que podr\u00e1 agilizar su proceso de producci\u00f3n y tendr\u00e1 la posibilidad de tener m\u00e1s contratos, aumentando as\u00ed los ingresos que percibe para continuar velando por el bienestar de su familia ya que toda la carga econ\u00f3mica recae directamente sobre ella.

","en":"58-year-old Liliam is a single mother to two children. Approximately 35 years ago she learnt dressmaking and shortly afterwards she did a course in haute couture, in which she perfected her knowledge and technique. Thanks to the course, she saw an opportunity for a profitable business in this field, so she decided to start her own dressmaking workshop. It is located in her home, from which she offers service to third parties, does design work and mending and makes clothes to measure for her neighbours. She currently has a contract with a big business; she collaborates with three other people to produce packing bags for said business. Liliam is an active, enterprising, thriving, and persevering woman. She is requesting the loan in order to invest it in purchasing an industrial flat-bed sewing machine, with which she will be able to accelerate her production process. Then she will have the opportunity to have more contracts, thereby increasing her income and enabling her to continue looking after her family\u2019s welfare. The financial responsibility rests directly on her. Liliam dreams of giving continuity to her business, getting it accredited, and making it more profitable so that the profit margin will allow her to buy her own house and enjoy the fruits of her hard labour and a better quality of life with her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1434414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

He has done farming work in the country, producing organic cacao and coffee, for five years. He says this is thanks to some parcels of land he bought together with some other farmers at a good price in an area on the outskirts of the city which has very fertile land. He does his work with the help of workers from the area, who give him all their support as far as group work is concerned, managing in this way to finish the daily work of maintenance and caring for the different fields in less time. However, the rainy season is a period in which maintenance work is affected by the mud and slippery paths. Finding himself in the middle of a productive season, he wishes to fertilize his cropland with organic compost and contract workers to carry out the second weeding of his fields. This is his third loan with Kiva and he feels grateful for the financial support he receives so he can get ahead. He is also committed to making his repayments on time.

Ertay has secondary education and is doing animal husbandry and field crop cultivation as a main source of income for his family which he started fourteen years ago with the purchase of cattle for 60,000 som (KGS). Thanks to his hard work Ertay now has one milk cow, one calf, forty sheep and one horse. His monthly income is 16,000 som. With the goal to further grow his business Ertay has come to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 70,000 KGS to buy a horse to increase the headcount of livestock. He plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of the livestock and plans to save some money to hold a wedding for himself.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1432099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

When she got engaged to Reynaldo they worked hand in hand on the constant job of maintenance and caring for the entire cocoa plantation.  At the beginning of their first crop season things did not go so well because the cocoa cobs did not have the adequate weight; so they were luck to get back any of the capital they had invested.

Various tasks got delayed resulting in minimal profits. Nowadays Clotilde has fields of organic cocoa which she keeps in good condition with the help of organic manure.

In order to further develop her farm, Aziza turned to Microcredit Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to fatten them up for resale on the market for a good price.

She had to help her parents to support the family by cultivating seasonal crops such as rice and beans. \r\n\r\nAfter being married, she settled down in a new home with her spouse and, aside from farming, they have also been involved in fishing activities to support their living.\r\n\r\nChum\u2019s main income relies on farming rice and fishing, so they must have enough materials to keep these businesses running.

She lives in a traditional family in M\u00e9dine, a neighborhood in S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nHaving never attended school for social reasons, she was still young when she started working as a saleswoman with her mother during fair days in her village and its surroundings, as did many young women at that time.\r\n\r\nShe was trained for several years, until her wedding. She then stayed in sales, electing to sell eggs. She's been running this business for ten years, and has a large clientele and a lot of experience. Her strength comes from the quality of her eggs, which are big and without cracks.\r\n\r\nIn order to bolster her working capital and meet customer demand, she's seeking support from Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso. She's been working with the MFI for 24 months, and obtained and repaid two loans.\r\n\r\nShe's seeking her third personal loan, to be used to buy 270 egg trays. She gets her supplies locally and sometimes in Bamako.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mariama always sells for cash, to a clientele comprising mostly shop and restaurant handlers. She intends to turn and average monthly profit of XOF 100'000 (ca US$ 200), to be used to repay the loan and take care of some family expenses. Her ambition is to ensure the future of her

She buys the young chicks by the box, raises them for three months and then sells them live or by the pound to neighbours or delivers them to local shops. She sells a lot of chickens because she raises them on corn and so their meat is similar to creole chickens. She works for 2 or 3 hours every day and this is how they get by in life, as her husband does not earn much in his job in the fields.\r\n\r\nElena will use this loan to buy chickens, food and medicines so that they will grow well and give her better profits. She is a founding member of the communal bank and she likes it for the support it gives her with the loans. Her dream is to keep making progress in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":717256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and feed and medicines for them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-09-19T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-19T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1384.04,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":138.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":138.4,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966244},{"amount":419.98,"local_amount":415.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":419.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857982},{"amount":280,"local_amount":276.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506351},{"amount":279.99,"local_amount":276.8,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":279.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730108},{"amount":280.03,"local_amount":276.84,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":280.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636189}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T20:44:13Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T11:24:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":609545,"name":"Katya Rosita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Katya es una joven de 19 a\u00f1os, es soltera, vive en la ciudad de Pisco con sus padres y hermanos, ella es muy trabajadora, entusiasta,que tiene un gran deseo de superaci\u00f3n; gracias a su esfuerzo se encuentra estudiando la carrera t\u00e9cnica de Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas.\nPor iniciativa propia, trabaja en su peque\u00f1o negocio de venta de productos de belleza y adicionalmente brinda atenci\u00f3n en un grifo de su ciudad, ella trabaja todos los d\u00edas por un aproximado de 10 horas y cree que le va bien por su dedicaci\u00f3n y esfuerzo.\nKatya se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestamistas Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindad comprara mayor cantidad y variedad de productos de belleza para abastecer su negocio, as\u00ed pues ella seguir\u00e1 trabajando y esforz\u00e1ndose para lograr su gran sue\u00f1o de ser una buena profesional.

She is married to Edgardo and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMercy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy a small amount of shampoo or cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMercy dreams to expand her business and hopes to have a good life. She meets every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1430085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Not having attended school due to societal reasons, she soon started to work in small-scale commerce along side her mother, who used to sell fish. After several years of apprenticeship at her side, she is finally working by herself running several businesses: selling grains and sheep and making use of a grinder (mill). \r\n\r\nWith the goal of acquiring new, shiny equipment to cope with customer demands, she turned toward the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She has had an association with the institution for the last 48 months. After two solidarity loans and two individual loans, which she repaid, she is now on her third individual loan, which she intends to use to purchase a grinder.

She lives in a nuclear family in the Sokalakono district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). She did not attend school because of her parents, conservative from years of colonization, who saw that educating girls was wasteful in life. So she started early on to work in small-scale commerce along side her mother, who used to sell fish. After several years of apprenticeship at her side, she finally opted to run a business buying and selling grains, especially rice.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing her business capital to cope with customer demands, she turned toward the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She has had an association with the institution for the last 24 months.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Thanks to Buaisha's hard work, she currently has two horses on her farm.  Her monthly income is 10,000 som.  \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Buaisha applied for a loan of 80,000 som from the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum and Partners.

He has everything that is important to him: a beautiful wife, healthy children and a good job. Raqibjon has a Volga car and uses it not only as a means of transportation, but also as a means to make a living. He drives people from his village to the city of Tutk Istaravshan and back again. In a day, he can earn up to 16 somoni. It's not much, but he likes to drive and taxi people from one point to another. Raqibjon is taking out a loan because his 1980 Volga broke down and he urgently needs to repair it. With the loan, Raqibjon will repair the car and get back to work. In the future, he hopes to buy a new car. We hope that, with your help, Raqibjon will have good fortune.

","en":"Every child boasts that his mom is the kindest, most gentle, and most talented mother around. Perhaps more than any other children, Salomat's children brag about their mother since she is a true master of her craft. Salomat is not only an outstanding cook, she also sews traditional dresses with embroidery. She embroiders with beads, colored stones, and gold thread, not only on dresses, but also on tablecloths. Sitting at a table with such a tablecloth is always pleasant. This kind of intense work takes a long time, and you don't notice how time flies. Since she was a child, Salomat loved to sew and embroider. She is teaching her sister-in-law this skill. With the money from the loan, she is going to buy different sized beads and colored thread for embroidery, so that her sister-in-law can continue to master this skill.
