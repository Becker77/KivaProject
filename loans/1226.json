They grow for three to four months until they reach an adequate weight, and then she sells them to merchants who come to her house to buy them and take them to other cities. This helps her very much, since work in the countryside is scarce, but thanks to her earnings, she and her husband can put food on the table. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy feed and medicines for both chickens and pigs.

The profits from the business will be used to reinvest for better, future outputs.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). \r\n\r\nDespite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nUrwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He lives in the rural area near Lahore, Pakistan. He is the father of five children and equally responsible for all of them. He is a milkman by profession, and he sells milk in the nearby town. He sells pure and fresh milk; this is the reason he is very famous in his town. Jahngir is poor, so he does not have enough buffaloes to get milk and does not have sufficient funds to buy more buffaloes. He does not even have enough money to maintain the cowshed.\r\n\r\nHe decided to buy heifers, because a heifer is cheaper than a buffalo and they grow up in a short time. He will feed them in a better way, and he will devote himself fully to the care of the heifers. He hopes they will grow up soon, so he could get milk from them. Therefore, he requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that he could buy heifers in bulk, could grow them up, and could get milk in large quantity. With the profit amount, he will maintain the cowshed and pay back all the installments due on the loan. \r\n\r\nThis time Jahngir is very hopeful, that he will earn maximum income and he will successfully change the lives of his family.

Hardworking people live in this district and one of them is Ziedali.  Ziedali, just like the majority of people in his native district, wants to get involved in animal husbandry - raising bulls.  Almost every family in Shahrituz has livestock in their yards.  Ziedali's grandfather and father were shepherds, and he wants to be like them.  He will spend the loan amount to buy cattle.

school. He has been running a fruits and vegetables business for five years now. He works from 07am to 08pm daily and is able to make a fair monthly profit. \n\nThis will be LUCAS's 2nd loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used the previous loan to buy the missing fruits and vegetables and has paid back the entire previous loan successfully. He managed to use his business profit to pay school fees and household expenses. LUCAS will use this loan to restock the out of stock fruits and vegetables. Lucas is doing fine with his genge (grocery hut).

Reap Province, Hang is one of the breadwinners of a family consisting of four children. Three of them are still in school. To make a living, she farms rice and cassava as a main source of income.

He is 57 years old and he is married with six children. He operates a garage and autos pares shop in Kilifi. He has been in this business for six years. It is his sole source of income. He heard about Milango from an employee and decided to join so that he could access credit in order to fund his business. He now seeks a loan to buy tyres and other auto spares.

To supplement the family's income, she and her husband grow rice and raise chickens. With this current business, she can earn about 37,800 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nKimly has been with Kiva's partner, VisionFund, for two cycles including this loan. The previous loan enabled her to improve her family\u2019s living conditions gradually. Kimly is now leading a group of four to get a new loan from VisionFund.

He does not have capital to buy new expensive mobile phones of different brands. For expensive mobile phones, he first takes an order and then purchases the new mobile from the market for his customers. This is a lengthy procedure; he wants to buy expensive mobiles so that he can sell them on the spot. He also wants to offers accessories. But he does not have sufficient capital to buy new phones and accessories. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Ashraf has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that he can buy mobile phones and accessories for his shop. Ashraf is hopeful that this business will work well and he will establish it soon so that he can earn income for his family.

She has four children who are all in various grades of primary school. She is married and works by farming potatoes to sell and earn income for her family. She also grows corn and beans to sell sometimes. Her main objective is to farm for consumption due to the high prices of these items on the market. For many years, she has farmed potatoes because her parents taught her how to work the land from an early age. This is her family's primary commercial activity. She completed one grade of primary education, which is thanks to her parents' help. Her biggest challenge is getting a great harvest to sell every season. There are factors such as rain, plagues, and other events that can damage her crop and make her lose the whole harvest.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to earn a good income at the end of the harvest so she can reinvest part of her earnings into her crops. She also wants to invest in her home because it needs improvements including the floor, crack repair, and a safer roof. This will improve her quality of life and give her children a better environment. This is why she is currently requesting a loan from COMIXMUL.

people grateful to God for what they have. Talbak has worked with his wife as teachers in a school in Yavan for 16 years. He is 38 years old. They have six children--four boys and two girls. His eldest sons are are in school. Although they are young, they feel self-sufficient and always try to help their parents and look after their sisters.  Like any teacher, Talbak teaches his children to respect and love the world. \r\n\r\nTheir sons adore animals, and when Talbak goes to the farmyard they ask their father to come with him. Talbak is getting ready for winter and wants to finish his barn. But, as a school teacher in Yavan, he doesn't have enough money for building materials. He is taking out a loan to buy building materials. Talbak and his family love their animals and wouldn't let them spend the winter

She is a very punctual and responsible client. In these three years she hasn't had a single late payment. She continues to develop her business fattening cattle. Mahbuba is the last child in the family and her parents don't want to let her go to Russia; they want her to stay here and continue her business. Of course, her parents help with the business. Her father does the buying and selling of the cattle. At the moment Mahbuba is in financial need and therefore has turned to Arvand for a loan. She plans to increase her number of cattle and further develop her business, which is the primary source of income for her family.

Much to her sorrow, her husband passed away a few months ago; he was always a source of strength and support for her.  She has 3 children \u2014 2 daughters and a son.  Her daughters are already married, while her son has yet to marry.  Biziyuda works as a nurse in a hospital.  Her son works in a private company, and also makes a significant contribution to the family budget.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Biziyuda wanted to renovate her home and see her son married, but she had to pay for her husband's funeral expenses.  She would like to have her home renovated before it gets cold, and have her son married thereafter.   Biziyuda and her son are counting on the support of Arvand; she hopes to receive a loan to buy construction materials to use for the renovation.

His family consists of his wife and three school aged children (a son and two daughters). Armen is currently engaged in livestock farming which is the main source of his families income. Armen also cultivates some vegetables, which are sold in the local market. The family\u2019s needs are growing day by day and he needs to work harder to earn a living. Armen currently is eager to enlarge the number of livestock he has. To be able to do so, he requests USD $3,000, which will assist him greatly to purchase cows and to buy some forage for his pigs. Armen has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to their hard work in recent times, Armen was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Armen and his family is thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1430305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a farmer by tradition, since her family has worked the land for generations for their living. She has been educated to third grade level. She is the mother of five children, the eldest of which is married and living away from home. The others are living with her and studying. Planting and growing potatoes is what her family does. At the end of the harvest, the produce is sold to intermediaries and neighbours, and then resold in the local market or throughout the country. Also sometimes when the price of potatoes is good she puts some of the profits into planting staple grains, such as corn and beans. Her crops are located approximately an hour and a half\u2019s walk away from her house. This distance is one of the challenges she faces, and it means she cannot be there every day.\r\n\r\nHer future plans are to improve her house as necessary, such as the floor, the roof, and plastering, in order to avoid the accumulation of humidity due to being uncovered. She also wants to continue supporting her children in their studies so that they can graduate and get ahead through their studies. She has requested a loan, with which she will buy certified potato seed and farming supplies to do the necessary maintenance to obtain an excellent harvest.

together with her husband, is raising two children. Nurizat has a university education. As the main source of income for her family, Nuriza practices crop farming. She started this business 8 years ago, with a start-up investment of 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nuriza's hard work, on her farm she currently has a 1.5 hectare plot of land, on which she grows peppers, tomatoes and beans. Every year, she receives a rich and bountiful harvest. She then sells her produce in bulk at the local vegetable market. Her monthly earnings are 15,000 som (KGS). For the further development of her farming business, Nurizat turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 65,000 som (KGS) to use for harvesting. Her intent is to hire workers, and she should not only pay for those who work for her, but also for a combine harvester to harvest the crops. Nurizat plans to invest the earnings from the loan into acquiring livestock in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1432163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

to work every day like it is a holiday. It is especially nice if one has known her profession since childhood and to go with it from an early age. \r\n\r\nHere Dilafruz has been lucky. From a young age, she has loved to cook and bake different kinds of sweets. And she still cooks because she is a pastry chef. She knows all about baking pastries. Most of all, she loves to bake cakes. Anyone who has tried her cakes has been pleasantly surprised. She learned to cook from her sister who is also a pastry chef, but her sister likes cooking pies and biscuits more. The two young women so love to cook that their craving for delicious and beautiful things has turned them into real masters. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Dilafruz is requesting a loan for repairs to the pastry shop. After the repairs, the place will be spacious and it will be comfortable for her to work in a new environment.

Her business is mobile since she goes to different markets so as to have increased sales. As much as she goes to other markets, she has maintained a stall in Ishaka town that she operates when she is not in another market. \r\n\r\nAdrine started the business with the objective of making money and having a clear source of income to sustain her family. In addition to the income she gets from the sale of clothes, her husband brings in income from his building contracts, which supplements Adrine\u2019s income.

she retired and went to the Ivory Coast to seek a visa to go to the United States. Unfortunately, she was denied one, and when she went back home, there was no job for her. With her remaining money, she opened her provisions and drinks shop in 2006.\r\n\r\nWorking six days a week and ten hours a day, Mariatu earns about 1,500,000 SLL every month. She would like a loan of 4,500,000 SLL in order to buy crates of soft drinks, crates of Maltina, cartons of sardines, and cartons of Peak Milk.

However, thanks to his hard work during the more recent times, Suren was able to run his agricultural business in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

Monthly income reaches 4,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her homestead, Elmira turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 20,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep to increase the count of livestock. \r\n\r\nElmira plans to invest income from the loan to further increase the count of domestic livestock and plans to save money for home repairs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1436317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-20T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-20T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":210.15,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10412.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.35,"payment_id":459019582},{"amount":186.03,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10412.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.47,"payment_id":624798746}],"funded_date":"2013-09-24T03:57:46Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T09:37:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":607685,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is a married woman, with five children.

His dream is to be able one day to buy a plot of land to keep his animals on, as he does not currently have one."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1435679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young bull.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-20T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-20T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rufino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500264}],"funded_date":"2013-09-20T17:47:51Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:27:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":607699,"name":"Melodia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melodia Melodia, who is married, works hard to support her family.

He has only been in business less than six months, but already has seen exponential growth with the help from Accion Texas, Inc. \n\nIn order to continue booking local events, Lonnie needed funds for start-up capital and part-time salaries.  A friend of Lonnie\u2019s told him about Accion and how it could help his business. Once Lonnie inquired and applied for a microloan, it was a short turnaround to receive an approval. \n \nThe Accion loan allowed Lonnie to pay his four part-time employees, purchase supplies and food, and have start-up capital for his new business. Without the loan, Lonnie\u2019s business plans would have changed.  The Accion loan allowed expansion plans to continue on track and hire additional staff.\n\nThanks to the loan, Lonnie says his business will grow faster than he imagined.

Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":604768,"name":"Larisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"To Larisa, it seems like dance has always been a part of her life. However, it was not an easy path. Born with severely clubbed feet, she wore casts on her legs for the first nine months of her life. Her doctors doubted whether she would ever walk normally, but Larisa had other plans! At 18 months, she took her first steps, and at age five, Larisa turned to dance to strengthen her feet. She struggled with ankle pain throughout childhood, but she kept on dancing, stricken with what she calls \u201cthe fever\u201d! \n\nLarisa continued dancing and won numerous competitions. She recalls dancing in the 2001 Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, as part of the Tap Dancing Christmas Trees, just two months after September 11. \u201cIt was surreal being in New York at that time,\u201d she shared. Dancing helped build Larisa\u2019s self-confidence and gave her a sense of pride.  Her experiences motivated her to help others overcome their obstacles and to experience the joy of dance. \n\nIn her 20\u2019s, Larisa moved to San Diego and was determined to set up a dance studio. She then researched local dance studies and realized that there were few tap dance opportunities in San Diego. As a result, in 2008, she opened Tap Fever Studios, a non-profit dance school with a focus on tap. Tap Fever\u2019s mission is building self-esteem, athleticism and giving back to the community. Classes include tap, jazz, ballet, contemporary, hip-hop and partner dancing. Tap Fever provides accessible classes for people with disabilities, dance scholarships and mentoring for teens. \n\nThe summer months are typically the slowest times for dance studios, as people go on vacations. To help stabilize cash flows during the summer months, Larisa turned to her bank for a loan, but was unable to qualify for a traditional loan. Her banker suggested that she apply for a Kiva loan through Accion San Diego, a microfinance lender. \n\nA Kiva loan of $5,000 helps pay the studio\u2019s rent and utilities for the summer months and ensures that Tap Fever\u2019s programs continue to give people of all ages, backgrounds, physical abilities and incomes the opportunity to experience the joy of dance. \n\n\u201cIt is so rewarding to see the joy of students who are visually impaired, on crutches or others who just want to get healthier,\u201d she shared. \n\nFor more information on Tap Fever Studios and its mission, go to

is 53 years old, married and has 5 children.  He works as a solar lamp distributor in Mali.\r\n\r\nPrior to becoming a distributor for NOTS, Daniel studied agriculture and engineering and worked as a farm manager at a Malian textile company.   Upon learning about the work of NOTS Mali, he was very motivated to become a distributor because he knew solar lamps would be a great benefit to people living in the rural areas where he lived and worked.  \r\n\r\nDaniel sells solar lamps directly to farmers and through small retailers and individual entrepreneurs in Sikasso, the southern-most region in Mali.   Most people living in this area work in agriculture and about 80% of the population does not have access to electricity.  They rely, instead, on kerosene, flashlights and candles for light and they must walk long distances and pay to charge their mobile phones.  On top of being harmful to the environment, time-consuming, and damaging to users' health (inhaling kerosene fumes is like smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day), these energy sources are expensive, costing a family at least $80 per year.   \r\n\r\nA solar lamp has a lifetime of about 5 years and costs $25.  Purchasing a solar lamp is a win-win-- families benefit because they save time and money and they are safer and healthier and the environment benefits from less toxic waste and reduced CO2 emissions caused by kerosene use. \r\n\r\nThe funds from Kiva investors will allow Daniel to purchase solar lamps and sell them to cotton and sesame farmers on credit.  These lamps will impact approximately 4,000 lives.  Harvest season starts in September, so it is a good time for Daniel to sell lamps as the farmers will have some money to pay for the lamps.  It is difficult, however, for them to pay in one lump-sum payment, so Daniel will collect payments in installments.  This way farmers can access solar light without so much financial strain on their household."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":20275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":20275,"image":{"id":1435524,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2884,"youtubeId":"Vz2drUJADmo","title":"Kiva Borrower Daniel from Mali","thumbnailImageId":1434170},"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy solar lamps that he will sell to cotton and sesame farmers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":"2013-09-20T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-20T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":20275,"lender_count":613,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":9828160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":20275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9828160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7612.56,"local_amount":3690133.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-08T08:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3691431.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829119},{"amount":12662.44,"local_amount":6138026.67,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-29T08:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6140186.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468016913}],"funded_date":"2013-09-23T18:33:27Z","paid_date":"2014-05-29T08:55:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janessa Karawan","image":1204200}},{"id":606510,"name":"Tarbiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tarbiya is 57 years old.She is married and she has 6 beautiful kids.

activist for differently-abled citizens, Jose represents individuals who make claims for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and mostly works with the San Antonio AIDS Foundation.  Jose\u2019s future plans are to work with similar nonprofit agencies.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, SSDI accounted for the income of 9.8 million people in the United States, giving them a chance earn a living with their physical limitations.  As of July 2013, 54,273 Americans benefited from SSI.  It is through Jose\u2019s business, Gaucin Disability Advocacy, that qualifying citizens in San Antonio and its surrounding areas are able to receive the complete amount they are due since they are unable to work.\r\n\r\nJose says Gaucin Disability Advocacy offers representation, a service not available at any other law firm. Within his business, Jose offers \u201crespect to beneficiaries and so many deserving members of our community, and (my) experience to win disabled claims in a timely fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf ever in doubt about the process of his business, Jose says the Social Security Administration offers technical advice and assistance online, through the phone, or in person.  This ensures that Gaucin Disability Advocacy is complying with Federal procedures. \r\n\r\nThough Jose has seven years\u2019 experience working for the Social Security Administration, he recognized his weakness in marketing his business within his hometown.  Needing to strengthen his weakness, Jose searched for a business loan.  After learning of nonprofit microlender Accion Texas, Inc., he applied for a loan to ramp up his marketing abilities. With his loan, Jose was able to develop an image for his business and better advertise his services.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am passionate towards helping the disabled in their needs,\u201d Jose says.  He has the ability to help the 26,490 disabled citizens in Bexar country.  A loan of $25 to Jose will help him help others. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1421059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to market his advocacy business.

She is grateful to Kiva and MiCredito for the support they have provided.  Her fist loan allowed her to invest in products such as basic grains and sausages which have been of great importance in increasing her number of customers and income.
