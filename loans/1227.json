But it\u2019s all right; I feel comfort here since actually they are friendly, and the teachers are nice, too. I joined youth church activity called TERAMO. I am able to manage my time well for both of my school and church activities.The financial condition of my family is not good. My parents are poor, and we also have debt to the bank, so they cannot pay my school fees. Now, I am standing near the \u201cDropout Gate\u201d. Hopefully, to all generous Kiva lenders, I would like to ask you to help me so that I can carry on my study, and at last I can reach the dream of my life. My hometown is Sajiram. It is geographically hilly, rocky and far from a big city. The job of my father is a government officer. His salary per month is between 1 \u2013 3 million rupiahs. The number of children in the family is four, including me. Their ages are 7 years, 11 years, 13 years and 17 years old.If I am given the Kiva loan from lenders, I will spend it to pay my school fees. At school, I learn many lessons, for example, English, computer and networking (my vocational majority), chemistry, math, Indonesian language and so on. I chose the computer and networking because I am interested in computers; computers are unseparated things from the world and human life. Besides that, I want to be a computer expert.After graduation, I want to get a job in a foreign company. (There are) some fun (parts) about school, such as having new friends and sharing each other.\nIn the picture, Ferdinandus and Benediktus his father."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1429060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

In addition, Ana Celea also works with sewing activities, which represents an additional income for the family. Her parents left her a small piece of land located 15 minutes away from where they live and in which, together with her husband, she started producing coffee six years ago. They have learned a lot from this work. They sell the coffee locally. Every member in the family is involved and they were taught to work hard and remain together since they were very young.\n\nHer biggest dream is that her younger daughters can become professionals and can have a better future; this is why she and her husband fight to make it come true.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct sales brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer, then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and the margin is the profit that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVangie hopes to have a good life and dreams of expanding her business. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She belongs to a huge family and sometimes it is very difficult for her to feed each of her children each day. She has to face a very tough time due to lack of finance.\r\n\r\nIn fact her husband is a driver by profession and provides transportation services using his three-wheeled rickshaw. He does not have any other source of income except the rickshaw. He has to do a lot of hard work by day and night to get a reasonable income. He has been driving a rickshaw for many years to meet the family's expenses, but now it requires proper maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Khalida has applied for a loan for her husband. He wants to buy new tires and some do some maintenance on the engine which is needed for his vehicle. This will help him drive more smoothly and provide better transport service for his passengers. \r\n\r\nKhalida is hopeful that the rainy days will come to an end one day and this loan will be a productive one for her husband and will bring positive changes for her family. Khalida is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1431185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for maintenance on the auto-rickshaw.

He fattens them and takes their meat to the central bazaar for the butchers and customers purchase. People use mutton for traditional dishes like kababs, dolmas, pilovs, etc. \r\n\r\nHe has taken a loan previously and he has a good loan history. This will be his   second  loan.

Her previous loan was a big help in her business. She was able to buy additional supplies and merchandise products for her direct selling business. The loan also helped in the education of her child. Her income from her business assisted in their everyday expenses at home. She and her husband both work hard to provide for their family. To have additional income, she is also selling meat.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan to buy more merchandise items and products to increase her product inventory. The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her child\u2019s education and daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nGemma dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her child will finish his studies.

Pakistan. Her husband is a hawker and sells fruit on a cart in their hometown. He goes to the fruit market on a daily basis early in the morning to buy fresh seasonal fruit such as mangoes, bananas, peaches, apples, grapes, etc. He is very famous in the community due to the freshness of the fruit he sells. \r\n\r\nHe has been selling fruit for many years. As a result, he understands his customers' preferences and the people's demands. Now he has grown old and cannot walk as much, so he rents a shop to continue his fruit selling business. However, his remaining funds do not allow him to buy fruit to sell. Therefore, Kishwar requested a loan so that her husband can buy more fruit, especially seasonal fruit. \r\n\r\nThis is Kishwar's first loan. She promises that she will pay all installments on time because she wants to get a larger loan in the future. Kishwar is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNote: Kishwar is raising her hand in the picture. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1431238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy fresh fruit to sell.

She helps her husband in his work as well as she sells stitched embroidery in her town. \r\n\r\nBy this time she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nShe is a mother of three children and is motivated to provide for her family. To cope with the increasing demand of her customers, she requested a loan to purchase a machine for embroidery. She hopes to get a boost in her earnings through her large sales. She wishes to utilize a portion of the revenue to provide a quality education for her children. \r\n\r\nShabana says thank to Kiva and to its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

They had to work every day cutting cotton and farming and then, in the evening, Gladis had to help her mother with the housework.  Her husband also works in agriculture.  Gladis is the mother of 8 children, the two youngest of whom are in the third year and final year of secondary school.\r\n\r\nShe runs a small shop in her home which she set up 2 years ago when she saw how the local residents needed one.  There was no shop and so she saw it as a chance to boost her family's income.  Before setting up her shop, she had sold filled tortillas but she gave this up to concentrate on her shop.\r\n\r\nWhen she wants to stock her shop, she has to travel to a town 3 kilometres away from where she lives and so she has to pay for a motorbike taxi to transport the merchandise to her home.  She works all day, seven days a week and her younger daughter helps her to dispatch goods when she is not at school.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to obtain more stock for her shop, such as basic items, sweets and other items which are sold in the area.  This greater quantity of goods will enable her to boost income for herself and her family.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that, in the future, she hopes to improve her shop by having a special area built for it and thereby generating a higher income for herself and her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1435882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock her shop, buying basic goods, sweets and other items which are sold in the area.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-21T16:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-21T16:20:09Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":47.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":49.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":53.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.44,"local_amount":41.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":41.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856959},{"amount":41.14,"local_amount":41.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":41.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505222},{"amount":42.53,"local_amount":42.53,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":42.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716300},{"amount":43.25,"local_amount":43.25,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":43.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621930},{"amount":44.34,"local_amount":44.34,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":44.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088173},{"amount":47.28,"local_amount":47.28,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":47.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902431},{"amount":45.77,"local_amount":45.77,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":45.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215640},{"amount":49.82,"local_amount":49.82,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":49.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817041},{"amount":48.18,"local_amount":48.18,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":48.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242521},{"amount":146.25,"local_amount":146.25,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":146.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525626}],"funded_date":"2013-10-20T14:26:35Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:13:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":608124,"name":"Tureme Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"J.

She also raises animals like guinea pigs, pigs and chickens in quantity.  This helps her earn extra income because she sells them to local butchers; they are also for her own daily food consumption.  Her greatest secret is growing her own alfalfa which is her animals\u2019 main food source.\r\n\r\nThis is her second Kiva loan so she\u2019s grateful for the support provided for it helped her cover some business expenses.  She promises to be a responsible person and to make her payments punctually.

lives in the Ndaragwa area of Kenya, which has one of the cooler climates in Kenya. He has three children. He has been farming for three years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Income from farming.' His biggest challenge is 'Marketing the produce.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nOnesmus was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Good loan terms.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: 'Savings as a foundation for the group co-guarantee.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked:  'How will this loan benefit your family,' Onesmus replied:  'I will be able to educate my children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Onesmus owns a cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a sewing machine, but does not have a mosquito net, electricity, solar power, running water, TV, or

He completed 9th grade in town and to get to school he had to walk 25 minutes along mountain roads to shorten the distance.  His parents were unable so support his high-school studies because that school was even further away and he\u2019d have to spend even more money.  He lives with his parents, two siblings and a nephew.  They all depend on the income he earns and from his father\u2019s support who also works in agriculture and raising small animals.  He\u2019s been attending the local church for a year but does so in the evenings after completing his agricultural chores.\r\n\r\nHe grows corn, beans and sorghum with his father.  He learned to work while still very young.  His father taught him the chores and this is how he now does his work.  He decided to work because he has to support his family and to provide them sustenance.\r\n\r\nHe also raises small animals (pigs).  He learned this from his parents because they\u2019ve also always had pigs to fatten up and sell in the city.  His siblings help him care for the pigs while he\u2019s working in the fields.\r\n\r\nElmer\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy manure for the corn field because he\u2019s planted 14,000 square meters of corn and beans and needs to buy 5 sacks of manure, fertilizer and to pay labor costs and to buy three pigs.   With this, he\u2019ll guarantee his family\u2019s food needs and will earn profits from the pig sales which will make it possible for him to buy more pigs to fatten up and sell.\r\n\r\nElmer dreams with building a better house for his family.  In future, if possible, he will continue with his high-school studies.  He will use profits to continue buying pigs to gradually increase step by step.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1436518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy supplies, to pay labor costs and to buy three pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-21T18:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-21T18:40:12Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmer Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":129.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":141.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.2,"local_amount":110.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":110.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716302},{"amount":389.8,"local_amount":389.8,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":389.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088760}],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T23:40:39Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":608032,"name":"Merah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!

is 52 years old and a married man. He lives in a small village of Martvili district with his wife, two children, and mother. His mother is provided with a retirement pension. His daughter works at a local bakery as a baker, and she gets a small monthly income. Genad has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, because his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. Sadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Genad was unable to study for a professional career.\r\n\r\nGenad works hard on family-owned agricultural land. He has a vineyard and grows nut trees. He always has high-quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. Besides the agricultural activities, he trades in fruits and vegetables seasonally. As the family has only seasonal income, Genad decided to open a grocery store. He sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting a business. Genad's application was approved under the framework of this program, and he will get a loan of $5000 US. With the received credit, he will purchase a stock of groceries and will open a grocery store. He will offer a wide assortment of products to his customers, to satisfy them. The new business initiative will give him a chance to have financial stability and monthly income."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1431356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a stock of groceries and open a grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tamakoni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-09-21T18:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-21T18:40:12Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":176.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":176.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":180.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":191.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":192.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":194.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":199.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":201.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":205.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":210.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":213.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":218.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":221.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":225.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":232.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":233.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":238.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":242.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":247.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":251.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":256.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":610790,"name":"Yarince Misael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yarince es originario de la ciudad Estel\u00ed.

Este cant\u00f3n se encuentra a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de Quito, y tiene diversidad de bosques, adem\u00e1s sus barrios est\u00e1n poblados con gente amable y costumbres propias de esta ciudad en donde tambi\u00e9n se encuentran establecidas varias microempresas administradas por los emprendedores que luchan por hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os cada d\u00eda. Otras de las actividades sobresalientes son la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda, produciendo abundantes cultivos que luego son comercializados para distribuirse hacia muchas provincias. Tambi\u00e9n posee varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos como cascadas, r\u00edos, senderos, balnearios en donde el turista es atra\u00eddo por los deportes de aventura que se venden all\u00ed con seguridad garantizada.\nNancy tuvo que trabajar desde que era muy ni\u00f1a ayudando a sus padres quienes se dedicaron a la crianza de cerdos. Ella decidi\u00f3 emprender con este negocio independientemente desde hace 8 a\u00f1os y ha aprendido cada vez m\u00e1s sobre esta actividad, sin embargo hace 3 a\u00f1os hubo presencia de vientos huracanados que destruyeron gran parte de la casa en donde viv\u00eda y los criaderos de cerdos. A partir de esos d\u00edas poco a poco ha ido reconstruyendo poco a poco su casa y negocio en el cual invierte al menos 10 horas cada d\u00eda, adem\u00e1s de que paralelamente atiende los quehaceres de su hogar. La \u00e9poca m\u00e1s complicada de este negocio es cuando las cerdas est\u00e1n pre\u00f1adas, pues requieren de mayor atenci\u00f3n para que los cerdos beb\u00e9 nazcan en mejores condiciones y no sean aplastados. Ahora Nancy requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para seguir creciendo con su negocio, pues lo utilizar\u00e1 en la elaboraci\u00f3n de nuevas chancheras para as\u00ed dar lugar a m\u00e1s cerdos e incrementar sus ventas para de esta forma mejorar su estilo de vida y el de su familia y adem\u00e1s dar un paso para un d\u00eda poder realizar su sue\u00f1o de construir una casa propia con una infraestructura de calidad y adem\u00e1s tener una granja de cerdos con las herramientas \u00f3ptimas para su cuidado. Nancy agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por el apoyo con el microcr\u00e9dito y por la asesor\u00eda personalizada que recibe de ellos y adem\u00e1s agradece a kiva por confiar en su microempresa. ","en":"Nancy, 33, is a woman who due to scarce resources at home only completed elementary school and was unable to go any further.  She has three children attending public elementary school.  She works hard for them and dreams with seeing them become successful professionals.\r\n\r\nNancy lives with her children and her sister in Los Bancos, a canton in Pichincha Province, one of the Republic of Ecuador\u2019s largest.  This canton is located a few kilometers from the city of Quito and it has diverse forests.  Its neighborhoods are inhabited by kind people who follow customs unique to this city.  Several micro-businesses are established here also that are managed by entrepreneurs who strive daily  to make their dreams reality.  Other activities are agriculture and animal husbandry. Abundant crops are produced that are sold to be distributed to many provinces.  There are also many tourist attractions like waterfalls, rivers, paths and resorts that attract tourists to adventure sports that are sold there with safety guaranteed.\r\n\r\nNancy had to start working while still very little helping her parents raise pigs.  She decided too to go into this business for herself 8 years ago  and every time she\u2019s learned more about this activity.  However, three years ago hurricane-strength winds destroyed a large part of the house where she lived and the pigsties.  Despite this, she\u2019s gradually been rebuilding her house and her business where she spends about 10 hours daily while also doing her household chores.\r\n\r\nThe most complicated part of this business is when the sows are pregnant because they require intensive care so that the piglets will be born in good condition and not be squashed.  Nancy needs a loan now to continue growing in her business for she\u2019ll use it to build new pigsties in order to house more pigs and increase sales thus improving her and her family\u2019s standard of living as well as to take a step towards reaching her dream of building her own house with quality infrastructure as well as having a pig farm with the optimal conditions for their care.\r\n\r\nNancy thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the support the micro-loan provides and for the personalized counseling she receives from them; she also thanks Kiva for having confidence in her micro-enterprise.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1436510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

David works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize and nut trees. His high-quality products are sold to local retailers for a good price.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, David decided to start a transportation business. He sought credit from local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. A startup program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program for a loan of 3400 Gel. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the received credit David will purchase a truck to transport a variety of cargo, thereby increasing the family's income.

Today, she is proud to be famous in her community for being the best at making beautiful patterns with thread and beads. Now she has requested a loan of 10,000 Pakistani rupees to purchase more spools of threads along with packs of sequins, pearls and stones in different colors. She says that the women in her community are becoming more demanding with the passage of time and satisfying them is a challenge that Kousar has taken up. She has five children and wants to provide them with a better standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1431412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

From a young age his parents taught him very important values in life, how to lead a good path [in life], and how to work the fields. His fields are 1 km away from his home, so he has to walk through the hills and paths in order to reach them. During all of his life he has also formed part of the church in his community, where he goes almost every afternoon after his work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy cement, sand and iron, and to hire labor, since he needs to improve a corridor in his home.

He lives with his parents in Lagodekhi district. The family runs an agricultural business. They have four cows and a plot of agricultural land where eggplants and maize are grown. His mother milks the cows everyday and produces dairy products to sell. They always have high quality products which are sold to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Zurab decided to start his own business and seek credit from local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor standard of living. The Start-up program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program in order to get a loan of $5,000. With the loan, he will purchase a tractor and will get orders to cultivate land.

He lives with his wife in the Lagodekhi district of East Georgia. His wife is a housekeeper. \r\n\r\nAvtandil is involved in agricultural activities. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing cabbages, cucumbers, and eggplants. He always has high-quality products, which he sells to local retailers for a good price.  \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Avtandil decided to start a transportation business.  He sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because he was considered too poor.  The start-up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. \r\n\r\nAvtandil's application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of US$ 5,000.  He will use the money to purchase a truck to begin his transportation business. He plans to begin trading with fruits and vegetables seasonally.

She is a determined woman with a great desire to get ahead.  At 34 years of age, she is a woman farmer and homemaker, since she has three children from her marriage who study and support their parents with various tasks in the field.\r\n\r\nIt was her parents who taught her to work the land, since in her family it is a tradition and source of income to cover the needs of her children and her home.
