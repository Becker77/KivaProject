He lives in the Rustavi district with his wife, two sons and a daughter-in-law. Both of his sons work at a distribution company and get a small monthly income. Emzar is not employed nowadays. \r\n\r\nIn the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self employment helps inhabitants to make living. Because of that, Emzar decided to start own business; however, the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers when they request a loan. Emzar's credit requests were rejected several times as he was unable to satisfy their requirements. Emzar was able to receive credit in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, a startup program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

She is a homemaker, a farmer, and the mother of one son who is 8 months old. She has 6 years of education; she is grateful to her parents for having supported her studies so that she would be able to complete them, despite the economic difficulties and few educational centers to choose from in her community. \r\n\r\nShe has a lot of experience, since she has been planting and harvesting coffee for ten years. It was her parents who taught her to work the land, as this is a tradition in her family. The plot that she and her husband work on is their own, thanks to the purchase that they were able to make using the previous crops that they harvested. \r\n\r\nTheir land is located 15 minutes from their house, and they travel back and forth by foot. Her main customer is a friend and neighbor who is an intermediary and is known in the area as a kind and transparent person who is dedicated to buying and selling coffee.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to buy land to be able to continue expanding her crops and building up her estate for her son tomorrow and assure his future. For this reason, she has requested a loan, with which she will purchase compost, coffee-growing formula, fertilizer, insecticides, etc. to maintain and help out her crops and be able to get an excellent harvest at the end of the season. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1436711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase compost, fertilizer, coffee-growing formula, etc. to maintain her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-22T06:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-22T06:20:04Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1.69,"local_amount":34.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":34.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833765},{"amount":2.62,"local_amount":53.25,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":53.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042228},{"amount":0.95,"local_amount":19.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":19.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710570},{"amount":1419.74,"local_amount":28893,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":29033.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118196}],"funded_date":"2013-09-23T13:50:46Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:42:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Hedel","image":971490}},{"id":608165,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is 42 and married with three children between the ages of 11 and 16.

She recently resumed her studies, and is now in high school and planning to continue studying something that she likes. She is married and has four children who live at home. The oldest child is 15 years old and helps out with the different activities of the household, her aim is to continue studying next year. The second child is 13 years old and goes to secondary school, he studies mechanics during the weekends. The third child is 10 years old, he goes to primary school and helps his parents to take care of the cattle. Her youngest child is eight months old. \r\n\r\nFany Carolina cultivates coffee since 15 years back together with her husband, who also sells vehicles (cars and motorbikes) when he gets a chance to do business. The family members support each other with the daily tasks in order to increase their well-being and aim for a better future. This is why Fany Carolina is now applying for a loan at COMIXMUL. She will use it to buy inputs that can protect and strengthen her coffee cultivations, which generate the main part of their income and makes it possible for each one of them to study and to eat. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve their economic situation so that she can continue studying and completing her nursing degree. That way she wants to be a role model for her children so that they continue studying as well, and she will support them in all that they need, particularly when it comes to their studies.

The support she received from her parents during her youth was not the best, and her parents' financial situation allowed them to cover only the home expenses.  However, she is grateful to them for their efforts to ensure that she could at least begin her studies.\r\n\r\nShe makes a living performing domestic chores, and she also has a small parcel of land where she cultivates her coffee crops.  She learned this practice when she was very young, thanks to her parents who were farmers.  Her family members are farmers through generation and tradition.  Evelyn's greatest challenge is not the competition she faces, but the need for an excellent production and coffee crop at the moment of the harvest.  This allows her to be able to generate an income for her family and home.\r\n\r\nToday, she is requesting financing so that she is able to give better and greater maintenance to her coffee crops.

This is Th\u00fay's first loan with Thanh Hoa Fund of Poor Women.\r\n\r\nWith her business profit, Th\u00fay hopes for her children to do well in school, for her family to be healthy and happy, and to travel for vacation within the country.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1415859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Concesa works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nConcesa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and reselling them by piece. She also sells rice and frozen foods for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nConcesa is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nConcesa hopes to have a bigger store and dreams that her body will always be strong and healthy to do the things that she has to do.  She meets every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

His wife also works on the couple's farm (she plants vegetables) and is the mother three of Faustino's four children, who are ages ten, eight, and three. Faustino has another child, an adult daughter who works in a hotel, and her two children also live with Faustino and his wife. The couple's farm is one kilometer from his home, so he can walk there and generally spends all day working at the farm. \r\n\r\nFaustino has grown vegetables (chile, tomatoes, chayote squash, green beans) for the past 14 years and provides for his family with the income from his farm. Faustino has always been a farmer, and he only planted corn and beans until he began to grow a greater variety of crops. Faustino learned to farm because several organizations conducted agricultural programs in his community that were designed to make crops more marketable.  \r\n\r\nFaustino is applying for a loan to purchase three liters of herbicide, three liters of insecticide, two liters of foliage manure, and to pay five people who will help him adapt the fields where he plants crops. The loan is an opportunity for Faustino to boost his harvest and his income, which will mean a better quality of life for his family. The loan funds will allow Faustino to purchase the farming supplies he needs all at once and at cheaper prices. \r\n\r\nOne of Faustino's ambitions is to adapt part of his farm and make it suitable for installing an irrigation system. Irrigation would allow him to plant crops throughout the dry season and make his farm more productive than it is now. Dry-season planting would alleviate the financial shortfalls that Faustino has experienced. Faustino's income will allow him to plan how much to invest for the next planting season. This loan is thus a smart investment that will allow Faustino to reach his goals.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1436799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase three liters of herbicides, three liters of insecticide, 2 liters of foliage manure, two quintals of formula, and to pay five people to adapt the fields where he plants crops.

She is a woman who has endured some hard knocks in life. At a very tender age her biological parents gave her to strangers, who are now her adoptive parents. They were very strict with her and decided not to let her study so she could take care of the housework. At 15 she moved with her family to the city, where she started to work in a pottery studio, something she has done most of her life. With time she developed a disease that came from the making of these handicrafts, which separated her from her only source of income. At 27 years of age she met the person who would become her husband. They lived together for 22 years. Unfortunately he passed away in 2010. She was left alone as it was no longer possible to have children. Her only working experience outside of the 10 years of making handicrafts, has been doing domestic work for others. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to repair the roof of her house which is in poor condition.

His father is a retired government servant and hopes that Azam will be the next person to earn an income for family. His father has great expectations for him and Azam wants to fulfill these expectations. Azam devotes all of his time and concentration to his garment shop as it is the single source of income for his family. His shop is situated in the garment market where there is a lot of competition.

Azam must maintain the latest designs, rates, and delightful cloth colors to sustain his sales. The winter season is about to start and Azam does not have sufficient savings to buy garments for winter season. If he becomes unable to replace his winter season garments with summer season it will highly affect his sales.\r\n\r\nAzam is requesting a loan from the Kiva field partner BRAC Pakistan to buy winter garments to sell.

She lives in a popular neighborhood of Managua and has two children, who are in secondary school. Geoconda works as a supervisor in a free trade zone. \r\n\r\nHer main need right now is to make improvements to her home. The walls are made of wood and they are worn down from years of use.

take care of both her children and run a business at the same time. She started a Mouneh business, which is based on conserving food from one season to another in a very special way. She also prepares tomato pastes to be used in certain cooking needs, as well as several kinds of jam.\r\n\r\nHer business is quite enough to cover her family's needs, but not for any extra required need.

She is married and lives with her husband and grandmother. Her grandmother is provided with a retirement pension. Salome and her husband are involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land where watermelon, eggplant, cabbage, and maize are grown. They always have high quality products, which are sold to local retailers at a good price. \r\n\r\nBecause the family has only seasonal income, Salome decided to start a shoe-trading business and seek credit among local financial institutions. However, her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. The Startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Her application was approved under the framework of this program to receive a loan of $2000. With the credit, Salome will purchase a stock of shoes and then resell them at a good price. She plans to go to Turkey and purchase the products at wholesale prices and then resell among her friends and villagers. This will give her a chance to earn income and become financially independent.

nomadic tent, on a rented plot of land in Arhangai province of Mongolia. She and her husband, Otgonbayar, have been providing firewood as a sales business in the local market since 2008. They purchase bulk timber and chop it down to a suitable size for those in Mongolian gers and houses to burn in their stove.

I am very impressed and appreciate all the efforts of them and the rest of the Nazava team to provide a way for people to get clean, cheap and healthy water to the people of Indonesia. \nI am interested in the background, philosophy and goal of their company, namely make the lives of especially poor people better, easier and healthier, therefore I dared to dive into promoting Nazava products. \nI see that Nazava Water Filters are a way out for the Indonesian people, especially those that live far from cities to be able to access safe drinking water in an affordable way so that in the end they will have a better and more productive life. \nBesides providing safe and clean water, Nazava also forms an opportunity for people to own an enterprise because Nazava provides opportunities to everyone to become a re-seller in Indonesia. As such they can eventually create new job opportunities as well. \nI already contracted 8 agents to work in the greater Jakarta Area, than because this is such an enormous urban region with over 14 million people, I will need to add some more.  I see a great opportunity for this product in Indonesia. Because of that I have started to do business in other provinces as well like Bali. \u201c\nIn order to enable Mrs. Yufi to meet her ambitions she is in need of more stock. With this loan she can purchase around 200 filters which will provide safe drinking water to around 1000 people. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1434910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to provide safe drinking water to over 1000 people in Jakarta, Indonesia","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Jakarta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T05:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T05:00:04Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yufi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":22000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":613.11,"local_amount":6917150,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6940386.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440031990},{"amount":166.89,"local_amount":1882850,"processed_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-01T10:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1889174.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449685995},{"amount":370.25,"local_amount":4177150,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4191181.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459156132},{"amount":799.75,"local_amount":9022850,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":9053159.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467972347}],"funded_date":"2013-09-23T11:41:10Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:57:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":608536,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is a married woman who is 44 years old with three children ages 23, 21 and 16. .She is a tailor and has done this since 2008.

She is married with five children between the ages of 15 and 30 years old. She also has two relatives at home. In 1999, Mahawa established her retail business. She began this business to improve her children.  She works at the business 12 hours per day and 7 days per week.

She is a hardworking mother who is helping her family by providing tailoring services in her community. Her husband is a laborer who earns daily wages.She has been sewing cloths since her marriage because her husband's income is not enough to sustain the family.\r\nShe knows the techniques of tailoring very well. Her regular customers are mostly her neighbors, relatives and people in the local community. She earns enough to lead a decent life. \r\nRecently her sewing machine sustained water damage which broke some of the parts. She tried to fix the problem but it still is not in working order.\r\nTo help her continue her business, she has requested a loan to buy a new sewing machine and some packs of zippers and buttons to meet the increase in demand. \r\nIn addition to repaying the loan, she will use part of the revenues to pay for personal expenses.\r\nFozia is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner BRAC

She used the loan to solve the problems with her bathroom, buying a water heater and other essential fixtures for renovating and repairing the bathroom. By addressing these hygiene and basic need issues, she managed to improve the health of her family and their living conditions which has always been her goal. She claims that without the loan she never would have been able to do the renovations because of the small amount of income she earns. She is hoping that this renovation lasts for a very long time and she will not have any further need to redo or fix up things again in that area.

During his childhood, he studied through the fourth grade but his parents told him that he had to work in order to help the family since there were nine children.  Roberto got married at the age of 22 and he is the father of two daughters, ages 27 and 37.  The older daughter has been living in the United States for the past four years so that she can provide for the needs of her family and offer a better quality of life to her two young children who live with Don Roberto.  The younger daughter takes care of the household duties and earns a little bit of income by making hammocks.  \r\n\r\nRoberto\u2019s parents taught him how to work on a farm, in particular growing agave and raising cattle.  His two young grandchildren attend school in the community.  At the moment, Roberto grows corn, beans, and sorghum, in addition to raising cattle.  He buys his farming supplies in the city.  In order to do this, he must board two buses and travel 40 minutes in order to reach his destination.  He buys cattle at the street market that is located 30 minutes from the highway.  Roberto must pay for transportation costs in order to get the cattle to his pasture.  His daughter, wife, and grandchildren help with taking care of the cattle while he is busy looking after the crops.  \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used to buy two cows worth $600 USD each at the street market.  The rest of the money will be used for repairs around his farm since he needs to enclose his land.  At the moment, the cattle are able to leave the property since the existing wire fence is in bad condition.  The money will be of great benefit to Roberto since he needs to increase the number of cattle in his herd so that he can produce milk and other products to feed his family.  Once he is assured that his family is taken care of, Roberto can sell the cattle in the future in hopes of earning more income.  \r\n\r\nAmong Don Roberto\u2019s aspirations is to gradually increase his herd of cattle so that he can sell milk and other dairy products to the community since he has been in this trade from a young age.  He hopes to remain healthy so that he can teach his grandchildren how to farm since his daughters are already grown.  In the long term, he also wants to whitewash his house with cement and sand.  His house is made of adobe and in need of a few repairs.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1436505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two cows and to pay for repairs around his farm.

husband. Kanchaiym has specialized secondary education. She works as a teacher in the village school. As an additional source of income Kanchaiym does animal husbandry which she started eighteen years ago with the purchase of livestock for 4,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Kanchaiym now has one milk cow, one calf and eight sheep. Her monthly income is 8,500 som. With the goal to further grow her business Kanchaiym has come to the Microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to buy sheep to increase the headcount of livestock.

Madina has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Madina practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 6 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Madina's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow on her farm, as well as a 0.45 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans and peppers every year. Her monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Madina turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Madina plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also plans to save money for her children's future

He purchases dishes in Kutaisi and sells them among the villagers. He requested a loan to purchase stock, such as plates, cups and souvenirs, but Gocha  lacks access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for his business, as they require a stable income.

His grandparents are provided with a retirement pension. \r\n\r\nThe family has been running an agricultural business for five years. Specifically, they grow trees and from the trees they make brooms to sell. \r\n\r\nJeikhun decided to diversify the business and raise calves to sell. He requested a loan several times but his attempts were rejected. The start up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and MFO Credo, gave him a chance to get a loan of 3,100 Gel. With this credit, Jeikhun will purchase four calves, raise them, and sell them in his district. The increased income will help him to the cover expenses of his
