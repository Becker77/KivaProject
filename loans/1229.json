For a long time she had good earnings, \u201cI baptized the waterfall with business, but later competition appeared\u201d, she says. As she is already well-known, Teodora, still continues attracting visitors with coconuts, sweets, and beer. \r\n\r\nNow, in spite of the problems that she has with her knee, she wants to take her business a step further. She is planning on opening a bigger and more welcoming store. \r\n\r\nThis is her third credit with KIVA where she feels strong and happy, since she hopes to obtain the loan to continue with her goals. She promises to be punctual with her payments. \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 300 Peruvian Soles she is thinking of buying materials to make her handicrafts.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1437613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials to make her handicrafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":32.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":33.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":36.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":37.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":14.05,"local_amount":33.72,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":38.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353882},{"amount":13.73,"local_amount":32.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":37.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905660},{"amount":14.05,"local_amount":33.72,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-22T09:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":38.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091644},{"amount":15.11,"local_amount":36.26,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":41.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778240},{"amount":68.06,"local_amount":163.35,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-24T08:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":186.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598649}],"funded_date":"2013-09-23T18:39:36Z","paid_date":"2014-03-24T08:48:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diana Lima","image":830085}},{"id":611267,"name":"Porfirio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Porfirio, a sus 49 a\u00f1os de edad es padre de tres hijos y vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja.

He is married and has four children. He loves his family very much, especially his children.  Bakhtiyor is proud of his children and does everything to make sure that they grow and develop on par with other kids. Bakhtiyor's two older daughters have already married, but his son and one more daughter still live at home.  The family lives separate from Bakhtiyor's parents, in their own house.  Bakhtiyor has been working with Arvand for seven years and has taken out loans for personal reasons. He is a dependable client who always repays his debt on time.  Bakhtiyor works as a driver and earns additional profits from this business, but his primary occupation is raising livestock.

He is married and has three children. Shavkat's family still lives in his parent's house, in a small village next to a large field. After finishing high school Shavkat was not able to attend college, due to his family's financial situation. Instead he learned how to be a farmer from his father. They pasture cattle on the field next to their house and this provides income for the family. After marriage Shavkat decided to continue his father's business and took over the responsibilities for everything, so that his father wouldn't have to work hard and could take care of his health. Thus, Shavkat is raising livestock for a living and wants to expand his business so that in the future he will have enough income for a comfortable life. Also he wants to be able to provide his children with everything necessary and give them a good education. Currently Shavkat plans to buy a few more cows for his herd so that he can make more money. For this reason Shavkat has turned to Arvand and is requesting a loan to purchase the animals. Shavkat is thankful in advance to Arvand for financial assistance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1433599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shavkat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":713.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":737.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":762.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":786.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":154.55,"local_amount":713.3,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":736.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144328},{"amount":159.79,"local_amount":737.48,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":761.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960150},{"amount":165.2,"local_amount":762.48,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":787.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180917},{"amount":170.46,"local_amount":786.74,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":812.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875518}],"funded_date":"2013-10-05T21:04:07Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":609449,"name":"Jesugnon Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"JESUGNON est un groupe constitu\u00e9 de six personnes qui habitent le m\u00eame village et dont la repr\u00e9sentante (celle qui a la main lev\u00e9e sur la photo) se nomme Margu\u00e9rite.

She was widowed 27 years ago and she has five children, all grown and with their own families. Since her husband died, she has devoted her time to caring for her children and continuing with the planting which her husband lovingly did. He taught her about the planting seasons as well as the types of soil appropriate to plant in. Now she has some much-envied fields, since her secret is letting the soil rest so that it can produce better and nutritious food. She sells her harvest at the market in Pampas every weekend. When she has a lot of crops, she sells to the traders in the country's capital, from which food goes out to the rest of the cities. She also has cows and chickens, which help her to have more income. She says that every time she fattens the cows, she sells them to butchers who come to the town. Her chickens lay eggs that she sells to the people in her village. This is her third loan with Kiva, and she is happy, since she has been working with her association for many years. The members are good people who have a strong will to help each other. Cirila will invest the 2,000 soles in the purchase of organic fertilizer for her next planting.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1437633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":162.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":174.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":176.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":190.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":194.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":202.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":214.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":219.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":236.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.89,"local_amount":162.37,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":167.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353886},{"amount":65.36,"local_amount":174.3,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":179.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905666},{"amount":66.28,"local_amount":176.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-22T09:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":182,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091650},{"amount":71.38,"local_amount":190.35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":196.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778246},{"amount":486.09,"local_amount":1296.23,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-26T08:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1334.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598655}],"funded_date":"2013-09-24T16:08:47Z","paid_date":"2014-03-26T08:53:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":608706,"name":"Rukia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukia is a married woman who is very hard-working and enterprising.

To make a living Bakhtiyor and his wife work for the farming co-op. Mukadas milks cows and Bakhtiyor is a farmer. To supplement his salary Bakhtiyor also grows crops on his own 8 hectares\/20 acres of land. Bakhtiyor's house is in terrible shape and while Bakhtiyor has been planning to repair it for a while, it's hard to save the large sum necessary for it. However, the house is in such bad shape that it's no longer fit for living and dangerous. That is why Bakhtiyor has turned to Arvand for a loan which he will use to purchase building materials for his house. He hopes that his loan is funded and is thankful in advance for Arvand and their help.\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1432185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakhtiyor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":102.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":105.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":110.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":113.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":119.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":123.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673542},{"amount":102.6,"local_amount":102.6,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":102.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144329},{"amount":105.27,"local_amount":105.27,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":105.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960151},{"amount":108,"local_amount":108,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180918},{"amount":584.13,"local_amount":584.13,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":584.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875519}],"funded_date":"2013-10-23T14:18:46Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":608726,"name":"Teresia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresia is single mother of one child who is still underage.

He will thus continue working and striving to reach his great dream of owning his own house.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1435757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to do some home improvements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Renzo Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":149.77},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":159.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":161.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":171.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":174.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":181.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":196.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":196.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":205.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":211.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":221.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":228.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":237.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":247.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":256.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":610147,"name":"Konde's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le Banc Villageois abritant ce groupe de vingt-quatre femmes est cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2008.

He works selling cleaning products from his home, which he started doing 2 years ago, thanks to his mother who taught him the business. The idea came about when his family were going through a financially precarious time, since they did not have a stable income to pay for necessities and basic household expenses.\r\n\r\nEl\u00edas is an active and dynamic man, with an enterprising spirit which helps him to get ahead. He decided to ask for the help of a second loan with the aim of investing it in buying stock in bulk (brooms and mops) to take advantage of the discount he gets for cash payments. This will allow him to acquire merchandise at a lower cost and so increase the profit margin on his sales, meaning that he will then earn a larger income for his family. \r\n\r\nEl\u00edas dreams of strengthening and expanding his business so that in the future he can acquire premises in the centre of the city and set up his business there. This would mean that he could better display his products and attract more customers, which would increase sales. In turn, this would mean that he could make his family more comfortable and offer them a better a quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1437931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock in bulk (brooms and mops).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Ci\u00e9naga  de Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"El\u00edas Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":59767},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":61424},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":63127},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":64878},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":66677},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68525},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":70426},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":72378},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":74385},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":76448},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":78568},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":80746},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82985},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":85287},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87651},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":90082},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":92580},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":95147},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":97785},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100497},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":103283},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":106147},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":109091},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112116}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":608718,"name":"Violet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Violet is a single mother of two school-going children.

Teniendo en cuenta el punto comercial, Marlyn decidi\u00f3 convertirlo en una miscel\u00e1nea de mercanc\u00edas varias,  y poco a poco fue agregando el servicio de fotocopiaje y alimentos, como frituras y refrescos. Sus ventas las realiza de contado as\u00ed como sus compras y trabaja desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 8 de la noche, de  lunes a domingos.

She has been the owner of a store for 16 years now, taking advantage of the fact that her neighborhood was the product of squatting, and thus there were no businesses that sold basic home supplies in small quantities.\r\n\r\nShe started by selling food and basic living goods, but little by little she has been adding the merchandise of a general store, such as female accessories, stationery and even gas. She sells all these items for cash and credit, working every day since 6 am till 8 pm, buying in cash from wholesalers who offer her competitive prices so as to transfer these savings to the pockets of her customers.\r\n\r\nOlinda's greatest goal is to improve the infrastructure of her store and to refurbish her home. Her challenge is now thus to increasing her sales, so as to obtain bigger profits and to be able to save money for this. This is the reason why she is now requesting a Kiva loan. With it, she will buy stationery and gas tanks, as well as the food supplies that are on sale. With her Kiva loan she will be on a path towards her goals, which is precisely where the success of Kiva

She works every day in a market in the city and can be there for about 10 hours a day.\r\n\r\nMaribel is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help offered, she will be able to improve a room in her home.

Judith was accepted into the Universidad Saint Paul and now with the chance to achieve her dream, she is concerned about affording tuition fees. She plans on graduating in December, 2013 but without a loan from Vittana she fears that she will need to defer her graduation. With a loan, Judith plans on purchasing her much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Judith feels she will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. One of her biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. To help afford her school and living expenses, Judith currently works 40 hours a week as a accounting assistant. With a degree in accounting she expects to earn $15 a day. With one older sibling attending college already, Judith is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her own without the assistance of a Vittana Loan.

creative concepts. Her skill and eye for design and art separate her work from others in the Houston area. Just take a look at her website, http:\/\/www.veronicastupublicidad.com\/p\/nuestros-servicios.html, you\u2019ll notice the extent of Veronica\u2019s work. \r\n\r\nHer five years of experience shows within her work. Playing with the balance of tones, colors and black and white elements within a photo helps her make the most of her shoot\u2019s outcome as she directs her team, poses her subjects, edits and finalizes each shoot. However, Veronica doesn\u2019t limit herself to simple photos.\r\n\r\nAs part of her business, Veronica can create logos, calendars, invitations and photo illustrations, and guarantees effort surpassing her competition. Veronica says about her photography, \u201cFor me, it\u2019s an art, my passion and a blessing.\u201d And her passion shows through her work as she views her job as a lifestyle--she works to perfect each project. Veronica states on her website that because of photography: \u201cI have known the magic that holds a smile, a tear, a touch and a glance because I love what I do.\u201d Veronica offers plenty more services.\r\n\r\nShe ventured to Accion Texas Inc. to obtain a loan to update her equipment and begin offering more services to a larger clientele. After a friend informed her about Accion, the owner of Veronica\u2019s Arte Fotografico y Diseno decided to accept the loan saying her business wouldn\u2019t grow without it.\r\n\r\nCheck out her most recent work on her Facebook page: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Veronica-Fotografia\/303801119630571\/.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1432901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to update equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Houston, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":608804,"name":"Uriel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Uriel is currently attending the Universidad Mayor De San Andr\u00e9s, working towards his degree in accounting and auditing.

Blanca was accepted into the Instituto Nueva Bolivia and now with the chance to achieve her dream is concerned about affording graduation fees. Often there are fees for earning your title in culinary arts before graduating.  She plans on graduating in December, 2013 but without a loan from Vittana she thinks that she may need to take time off to work and save until she can return to school. \r\n\r\nBlanca currently works 30 hours a week as a phone operator and earns $6 a day.

a\u00f1os respectivamente. Viven en Los Bancos un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Pichincha, una de las provincias  m\u00e1s grandes en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Este cant\u00f3n se encuentra a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de Quito, y tiene diversidad de bosques, adem\u00e1s sus barrios est\u00e1n poblados con gente amable y costumbres propias de esta ciudad. Laura y su familia viven en una zona alejada del pueblo, en la finca que tambi\u00e9n es su campo de trabajo. \nAl ser este cant\u00f3n una zona tropical, es el lugar en donde se dan las plantaciones de frutas tropicales m\u00e1s demandadas en el mercado nacional e internacional, es por esto que Laura hace 5 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 la producci\u00f3n de cacao, cuya actividad aprendi\u00f3 de varios familiares que se dedicaron a la agricultura. Con la ayuda de sus suegros se dedica a su negocio al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda, y la parte que m\u00e1s le toma tiempo es la recolecci\u00f3n del cacao que es en forma manual y requiere de mucho cuidado, pues al hacerlo con machete hay riesgos de cortarse o sufrir alg\u00fan accidente. Laura cuenta que en la finca tienen espacio que no est\u00e1 siendo aprovechado y es por eso que requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para implementar nuevos cultivos de pl\u00e1tano y ma\u00edz que le generar\u00e1n mayores utilidades y adem\u00e1s le ayudar\u00e1n a dar pasos de avance para poder adquirir en el futuro el terreno en donde mantienen sus cultivos.

She completed elementary school and got married at a young age to Rommel, who appears in the photo and is now 30 and works an extended schedule as a security guard.  They have two children, ages 15 and 8.\n\nThey live in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pinchincha, one of the largest provinces in the Republic of Ecuador.  This canton is located a few kilometers from the city of Quito and has a variety of forests.  In addition, the people who live in the neighborhoods there are friendly and have traditions typical of this city.  Laura and her family live in an area away from town, on the farm where she also works.\n\nThis canton is in a tropical area so there are farms that produce the tropical fruits that are in most demand in the national and international markets.  This is why Laura started growing cacao five years ago.  She learned the job from several relatives who work in agriculture.  She works at least eight hours a day with the help of her parents-in-law.  The most time-consuming part is harvesting the cacao.  It's a manual task that takes a lot of care because there are risks of getting cut or having an accident when working with a machete.\n\nLaura says she's not making the most of some space on the farm, so she's requesting a loan to start growing new crops, bananas and corn.  These will earn more profits for her as well as help her take steps toward being able, in the future, to buy the land where they grow their crops.\n\nLaura dreams of seeing her children become professionals.  This is why it's so useful for her to have received the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and the Kiva lenders who, even though they're not in her country, contribute to making her dreams come true.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1436624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to grow bananas and corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T21:50:04Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1324.01,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":104.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":111.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.7,"local_amount":87.63,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320674},{"amount":101.26,"local_amount":101.18,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":101.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856358},{"amount":102.86,"local_amount":102.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":102.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995267},{"amount":104.99,"local_amount":104.91,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":104.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413707},{"amount":107.25,"local_amount":107.17,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102348},{"amount":820.94,"local_amount":820.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":820.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212238}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T17:44:10Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":602038,"name":"And Siggil Hann 6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"L\u2019Association And Siggil Hann regroupe plusieurs femmes ressortissant de l\u2019une des banlieues Dakaroises.

She begins each work day at 8am and works until 8pm in the evening.\n\nThe profits that Aminata earns through her business allow her to help out with the everyday expenses of her household. She is the member of one of the branches of UIMCEC where she is requesting a loan to purchase fabric and clothes for resale. She hopes to increase the profits she earns with this loan. She hopes to contribute to the improvement of her family's dietary conditions.

She then resells this for cash at the market and from her home to a customer base made up mostly of women. \n\nDjeneba hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 20,000 francs CFA with this loan, which will be used to provide for her children's needs and to increase her business capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1425211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Benzana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djeneba                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ba Satou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeliya   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Badiallo   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":60093.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207735},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":60093.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972427},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":60093.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624977},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":60093.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850985},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":60093.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740651},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":60093.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220235}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T17:12:18Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T15:25:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Long Phillips","image":1429530}},{"id":608892,"name":"Rowena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Rowena.

He started learning business when he was eighteen, since he helped his godfather in a butcher shop, where he learned a lot of what he knows today. Thanks to that, he currently runs a grocery store and butcher shop, which he set up six years ago. He works on his own every day from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm, and this has allowed him to generate the financial resources he needs to support his wife and children.\r\n\r\nThis client is an energetic, active, persevering, and hardworking man. He has kept his business going in spite of the problems that arise, since his business is located in one of the areas with highest crime incidence in the city and he is exposed to disorderly conduct and altercations among neighborhood gangs. He must also pay fees to the different groups operating outside the law in order to keep his business open to the public. Even so, he has managed to overcome the situation and has gradually made progress.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to invest in purchasing a display case and wholesale products to stock his business (dairy, grains, eggs, meat, cookies, pastries, sodas, and other items). This will allow him to improve his store's image and attract more customers, and he will also have a wider variety of products available for sale. This will result in an increase of sales and income, which will allow him to continue providing for his family. \r\n\r\nJohn's dream is to strengthen and expand his business, so that in the near future he can buy his own retail space where he could offer employment opportunities and improve financial stability for his family's wellbeing and to increase their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1438024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a display case and wholesale products (dairy, grains, eggs, meat, cookies, pastries, sodas, and other items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T22:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T22:40:09Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhon Jaime ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119634},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122944},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126344},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129839},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133431},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137122},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140914},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144812},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148818},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152934},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157165},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161512},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165980},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170571},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175289},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180138},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185120},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190241},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195503},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200911},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206469},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212180},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218049},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224080}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":611208,"name":"Santa Ana Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las 16 integrantes de este comit\u00e9 cuentan con actividades variadas, cada una de ellas ponen su mayor esfuerzo para poder ir mejorando y saliendo adelante.\nLa se\u00f1ora  Ana es casada y vive en su casa de la ciudad de Caacup\u00e9 con su marido e hijos.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She prefers GHAPE loans because of low interest rates and convenient repayment intervals.\r\n\r\nIvodia is requesting a loan to buy a grinding mill to help her grind koki beans (black-eyed peas) in her house and also commercially. She will also use her loan to buy a bag of koki beans, two containers of vegetable oil, and to buy seedlings and pay for farm labor. Ivodia has a positive view that her business will succeed. She has been doing it for a long time and has good experience. Her business is well-located and she has a good approach that encourages her customers to buy regularly. She hopes her loan will increase her business activity and that the community will have to buy her products that she will be able to sell at cheaper prices. Ivodia will use the profit from her loan to pay her child\u2019s school fees, feed her family, provide medication for her family, and pay her bills. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1428436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a grinding mill, a bag of koki beans, two containers of vegetable oil, and seedlings as well as pay for farm labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

The members of this communal bank are in large part artisans, pastry chefs, and sellers of new and used clothing. Germ\u00e1n is an artisan who makes rope for maceteros (decorative ceramic pots). He started this work as a hobby, since he learned it in school, and five or six years ago he took it on as another job. He has not had big problems with his business, except for the lack of time to be able to cover all the orders he receives for his beautiful crafts. The money he is asking for will be used to buy materials like wire, sisal, and decorations for the cords. What he has liked most about being able to work with Fondo Esperanza the fact that he can participate alongside people who have his same interests."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3400,"image":{"id":1438073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded

hope that I can master it. I can speak it fluently. My problem at school is about paying the school fee.  My parents are poor; it is something difficult for them to do, but they want me to still continue studying. Learning many new things at school is very interesting for me.\r\n\r\nI joined the student study club. I think that learning together is better than alone. Everything runs well. We stay at an unpretentious house. I know that my parents are not rich and are poor, but I have a dream. My future is better than at present time. I\u2019d like to have a good occupation and a good salary. I can reach them all only with a good education.To all of the kindhearted lenders, I hope that you are willing to help me and my parents. \r\n\r\nMy home town is Cilacap. It\u2019s a dry, hilly and dusty town. My father is a laborer. His salary is about Rp. 400,000 (Indonesian Rupiahs). The number of children in my family is two. Their ages are 24 and 15 years old (me). Only I still carry on studying. This loan can improve my life because with it, I can pay my school fee well. I can concentrate more on my lessons. \r\n\r\nI take computer technics and networking as my majority. I like this because I am taught computer and networking deeply; about the hardware, software and the technology advancement day by day. \r\n\r\nAfter graduation, I\u2019d like to work in a company as a computer administrator\/technician. So far so good, at this school. It\u2019s fun because I have many new friends and new experiences. I feel that the impressing moment is when I\u2019m in a classroom and receiving lessons from my teachers. I love studying.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1433389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

Besides that, the teachers are also friendly. \r\n\r\nI am a member of the student football team. I can divide my time between school and after-school activities well. I enjoy playing football with my team, but I do not forget to study every day. \r\n\r\nMy problem at school is about paying the school fee. My parents are poor; it is something difficult for them to do, but they want me to still continue studying to the higher level of education. I beg Kiva lenders, may you help me to give funds for my school fee. My condition will be changed if I get a good occupation. The requirement of getting a good occupation, of course, is good education.\r\n\r\nI live in Persit village, Jeruklegi sub-district, Cilacap Regency. We have a broken soil road along the village to the sub-district. It is a hilly area. The occupation of my father is a walker-seller. He walks door to door to sell his products every day. His salary is around Rp. 300,000 (Indonesian Rupiahs). I am the only child in the family. If I get the funds from Kiva, it will be used to pay my school fee. It also will lighten the financial burden in my family. \r\n\r\nAt school I learn many lessons, for example, English, computer and networking (my vocational majority), chemistry, math, Indonesian language, and so on. I chose the computer and networking because I am interested in computers. Computers are an unseparated thing from the world and human life. Besides that, I want to be a computer programmer. \r\n\r\nSo far, so good, at this school. It\u2019s fun because I have many new friends and new experiences. We talk and share with each other.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1433400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

This way he will be able to increase his production capacity and to receive additional earnings so that he can pay for the basic expenses and necessities of his home. Omar is a fighter and a vigorous, active and persevering young man. He is always searching for options that will allow him to get his family ahead.

It will also help him to get to work, which is about 2 km. from his house. \r\n\r\nSantos hopes to be able to help his father in whatever he may need once they are out of debt. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1438104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a motorcycle.

In her youth, she was able to complete primary school in spite of the few schooling options available back then.  The years went by and she married and had three children, all of whom depend on her and her husband.  The oldest is 16-years old and is in her first year of high school.  The next is 4-years old and will start primary school next year.  The last is 18-months old.  Do\u00f1a Luz is a housewife and a coffee-grower, but she also plants corn and beans on a small scale.  She has made her living in this area since since was a young girl, as this business as well as the land she works were inherited from her parents.  Her parents worked hard to give them a better life.  Do\u00f1a Luz helps her husband in all aspects and activities related to the land, but is more involved until the cutting, as she has to take care of her two younger daughters.  The farmland is located near her home, so she can travel easily between the two to bring her husband his meals and help with whatever she can in the moment. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luz's greatest dream is that her children are able to study at the university level so that they have a degree with which to hold their own in the future.  In addition, she hopes to grow her business.  She will be able to do so by giving better maintenance to her crop, earning a better profit and re-investing the profit in her business.   And that is why today she is requesting a loan from COMIXMUL.  She will use it to purchase agricultural supplies to help her coffee crop and prepare it for the next harvest.

However, her parents taught her how to work the land at a very young age. Deysi has two children; her elder daughter is 11 years old and in sixth grade, while her younger daughter is 9 and in her third year of primary school. Deysi and her husband decided together to help her mother-in-law by taking her into their home. Deysi\u2019s business consists of growing coffee beans and she is very knowledgeable about the cultivation of this crop. In order to help support her family, she recently started a new project, a small grocery store that is located in her home. Do\u00f1a Deysi\u2019s fields are located close to her house, which is very convenient because at harvest time, she and her husband can work the land themselves.

Her son has become an expert and wants to start a separate business so that he can participate in generating income. Ishrat therefore requested a loan for her son to buy caps only.

As a main source of income for her family she does animal husbandry and field crop cultivation, which she started in 1981 with the purchase of livestock for 2,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Nurbubu now has two milk cows, two stallions, four calves, thirteen sheep and also 2.10 hectares of land where she annually grows beans and clover. Her monthly income is 12,000 som. With the goal to further grow her business Nurbubu has come to the Microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to buy a milk cow and to increase the headcount of livestock.
