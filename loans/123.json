children.  She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n                            \r\nLeticia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also retails electronic cell phone loads for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeticia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and  draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has a workshop with 2 machines, and lives with her husband and children who also dedicate themselves to this craft.  They have three employees and have been running the business from their house, in the town of Nimasac, Totonicap\u00e1n, Guatemala, for twelve years.  Currently, they find that customer demand has gone up but they don\u2019t have the financial resources to augment their working capital.  For this reason, they turned to the ASDIR Association to request a loan with the intention of using it to purchase raw materials.  This would allow them to increase their sales and, they hope, help them support their daughter and afford them all a better standard of living.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn

She has been selling tamales for several years.  Because this business went very well for her, she finished building her house and can educate her children.  \r\n\r\nBut, the constant rains last winter caused erosion, which cause landslides that damaged the area where her wood stove was.  Since then she does not make tamales.  She chose to sell \u201cbu\u00f1uelos\u201d (fritters).  She charges one PEN per portion.\r\n\r\nVilma likes her work.  At six in the evening she is at the side of the Paucartambo bridge until nine or ten at night.  It is an area which is heavily traveled by her neighbors and residents of nearby zones.  Vilma  brightens up her sales with her good character, which has allowed her to get many customers.  In three months she was able to make her business very profitable.  With these earnings she hopes to return to the space she had set up to sell tamales.  She would sell tamales in the morning, and in the afternoons she would continue to sell her bu\u00f1uelos with honey.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth consecutive loan working with MFP.  Vilma is very responsible with her payments; she does not like to make a late payment.  She encourages her colleagues in her Community Bank to not pay at the last minute.

She saves something every month at the Barclay's commercial bank.\r\n<p>\r\nShe received a previous loan from Novo Banco to purchase construction material and after finishing the loan she decided not to continue for various reasons. She learned about Hluvuku through a nearby friend who is also a client of the organization. With this first loan of 25,000 MZN from Hluvuku, she plans to buy construction material (tiles, doors and galvanized sheets) to finish her home.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to pay back this loan promptly, in order to be able to receive further loans. She would like to apply for additional loans in the future to complete the work on her house. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

He is 46 years old. Ruben is married. Ruben owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, junk foods & beverages in the local community. Ruben has been engaged in his business for over six years and earns approximately 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Ruben joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to do business. Ruben has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Ruben is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & junk foods. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Ruben from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She thanks you for your support.  \r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.  Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.  Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":181979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more goods in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-18T00:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mesi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-04T06:55:12Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316200},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-04T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347874},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347833},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970405},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886622},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435904},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130209},{"amount":69.99,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027042},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613082},{"amount":70.01,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80710,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010165}],"funded_date":"2008-07-21T06:55:12Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61043,"name":"Aba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aba O.

She lives with her husband and daughter in the La Libertad 2 housing community on the outskirts of Portoviejo.\r\n\r\nDelcita divides her time between the household chores and her business.  She has a store where she sells water, supplies, meat, fish, cleaning supplies, and personal use items.  She has been doing this for 12 years.  Her husband and her daughter help because her work schedule is from seven in the morning until eight at night.\r\n\r\nTo stock the products, Delcita buys wholesale in the market or from distributors who visit her store.  They supply everything she needs.  She says that she invests about 40 to 60 dollars a week to stock the store with the necessary items and get good earnings.\r\n\r\nThanks to the great help from the Espoir Foundation, she has been able to continue with her store.  She will use this loan to buy more products like rice and sugar by \u201cquintales\u201d (100 pounds).

Hadjah fries samosas and chapatti in Kawempe. She works in a semi-urban area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala.  She works seven days a week. She receives an average of 30 customers a day and sells to all categories of people at wholesale and retail.  Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family, school fees for her children and rent for her residence. Her major business challenges are transporting the baking flour, cooking oil and cowpeas to her business premises; seasonality, which makes her business difficult; and the rainy season, which disturbs her a lot because she works in an open area. Hadjah has been in this business for 10 years and with MCDT for five years. This is her 10th loan working with the same group mates. Hadjah joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women in the village. She wants to use this loan to buy more cartons of baking flour, jerry cans of cooking oil and a sack of cowpeas. She hopes to see her business grower bigger and to start employing three people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":478394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is single and lives in a rented room in Peru's central jungle because he believes it is an area with more opportunities for work.\r\n\r\nHis parents raised him to work hard to reach his goals, so he decided to study what he loved most: music. He learned to play instruments such as the harp and piano. He is most often hired as a harpist, because there is higher demand and it is more profitable within the folklore market.\r\n\r\nOn the side, he transports people on his motorcycle. With the earnings from both activities, he is able to send some money home to his family. He is able to cover his personal expenses and is saving to buy more musical instruments because in the future he wants to have his own orchestra. On top of that, he want to sell home appliances.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and he has demonstrated that he will make each payment on time to remain on good terms with his communal bank, which is composed of hard-working people brought together by their responsibility.

Her dream is to build her own house with concrete block and a roof.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wanted to improve her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti.

A..  They reside in Jaranwala, which is a small city located in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Ever since her marriage, she has lived with her family in a three-room brick house. Her husband is a carpet-weaver by profession. She, meanwhile, is a housewife who does her household chores at home. She has given birth to five sons and a daughter. Her three oldest sons work in factories and receive meager incomes, while her three youngest children are receiving their education at a local school. <p>\r\n\r\nNasreen is now seeking a loan from a Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan proceeds, her husband would like to buy carpet-weaving raw materials such as thread, weaving tools, and sketches. Weaving carpets by hand is a very difficult task but A. does this job well, primarily because he knows that he needs to provide financial support for their family. Nasreen is hopeful that her husband will make good use of the loan proceeds and will be able to generate an increase in profits by weaving additional carpets. Notably, this would be her second loan from Asasah. With respect to the prior loan, she paid her installments on time and attended every meeting.

is a 59-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: buying & selling herbal products, tricycle transportation and farming. She lives in Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Felisa is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Felisa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They live in a sugar cane producing region.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that a few years ago she decided to set up her own business selling breakfasts, because she says that the economic situation is more and more difficult and she thinks that she should help her husband with the household expenses and the education of their children.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda tells us that her husband works in the sugar mill and that every day she sends him his lunch. Sometimes her husband shared his food with his fellow workers who did not have breakfast, and as they very much liked the dishes and the seasoning that she gave to the food, they began to pay Do\u00f1a Yolanda to send them breakfast. Since then, she has sold breakfasts and lunches to the employees of the sugar mill. She is very happy because, thanks to this, she earns a little extra money doing what she most likes to do -- cook.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to buy eggs, cheese, beans, rice, oranges, melons, bananas, meat, mole sauce, tortillas, plastic cups, and glasses to prepare her foods.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda hopes that with this loan she can in the future have a shop where she can set up her breakfast room and thus her business will grow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":861913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to prepare breakfasts to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-15T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807672},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618769},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573010},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1865.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784733},{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":621.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193380}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T21:28:10Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":336442,"name":"Cristo Salva 1, 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esperanza is the coordinator of the Cristo Salva Groups 1, 2 & 3.

Her store is located in her home, in the town of telica half a block north of the mayor's office. She's had this business for 20 years. Maria started the business on her own because she needed to earn income for her family. She decided to establish a vegetables business in her house, but it didn't do well and she decided to quit the vegetable business in favor of selling grains such as rice, beans, and cooking oil. With this new business Maria earned the patronage of her clients.

She sells second-hand clothes in the small villages that are up to 5 days away by boat through the Ucayali river. Her business is to sell the items for cash or exchange them for other product like bananas, yuccas, and corn, among others.  For 2 years she has been working and making the trip through the river.  She likes the trip because it relaxes her and she is beginning to know other small villages where she can later sell her goods.  Also, the work makes her feel useful.  Teresa considers her business profitable because all her articles are sold as people do not have access to the markets or stores in the city. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, she wants to have a clothing store to stabilize her business because the constant travel and the long routes are very risky due to assaults. This it is her first loan with MFP, and what she likes about her communal bank is that she has noticed how all colleagues are united and responsible. With the money that she is asking for she will buy more variety of clothes in different styles and sizes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Reynolds, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":332516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-10T03:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":85.08},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":93.65},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":103.08},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":107.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":112.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.8},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.36,"local_amount":85.08,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":85.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990742},{"amount":31.22,"local_amount":93.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":93.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211843},{"amount":32.88,"local_amount":98.64,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":98.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641370},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":103.08,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":103.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080809},{"amount":35.8,"local_amount":107.39,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":107.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996950},{"amount":37.38,"local_amount":112.16,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":112.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842289}],"funded_date":"2009-06-10T05:15:00Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Reynolds","image":635173}},{"id":118422,"name":"Gloria Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Gloria Maria Guti\u00e9rrez, reside en el barrio Hialeah en la capital de Managua, tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad, con un hijo mayor de edad, es viuda.

Freddy M. R. is 48 years old and runs the business with the help of his wife, with whom he has 3 children from 3-10 years old.  They moved to this city 10 years ago from Magdalena where he managed some farms.  He wanted his kids to be able to study and they lived very far from the schools on their farm.  He decided to start his business when a neighbor in Cartagena encouraged him to do so after teaching him how to cut glass.  He found a storefront to start making doors and windows and selling glass, aluminum and other accesories.  He and his wife run the business and he contracts other workers when things get busy in order to serve his clientele.  He is seeking his second loan from Mario Santo Domingo Foundation of $800 which he will use to buy aluminum, glass and accesories to make his doors and windows.\r\n\r\nWith his first loan, he was very diligent both in investing his money and in paying it back; he improved his business and his credit history which is very important for him as an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nSomeday, he would like to have his own home, invest in livestock, but more than anything he'd like his kids to receive a formal education.  His biggest challenge is meeting his obligations during periods of low sales but he has learned to manage his business very well and get through those times.\r\n\r\nHis most difficult time was when he changed work from farming to what we does now; he's still surprised at the risk he took, but he considers it part of his past and his dream now is to move forward and his happiness shows that he is doing so.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":496397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase aluminum, glass, accesories to make doors and windows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":126052},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":139095},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":141993},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":144951},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":147971},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":151054},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":154201},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":157413},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":160693},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":176577}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.24},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.23,"local_amount":126052,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":129789.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677871},{"amount":74.18,"local_amount":139095,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":143219.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712252},{"amount":75.73,"local_amount":141993,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":146203.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895752},{"amount":77.31,"local_amount":144951,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":149248.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636079},{"amount":78.92,"local_amount":147971,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":152358.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850177},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":151054,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":155532.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116943},{"amount":82.24,"local_amount":154201,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":158773.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410811},{"amount":83.95,"local_amount":157413,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":162080.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550468},{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":160693,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":165457.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688073},{"amount":94.17,"local_amount":176577,"processed_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":181812.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427319}],"funded_date":"2010-03-01T22:52:04Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Crandall","image":163705}},{"id":184832,"name":"Sadio","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Sadio S. est une femme d\u2019une quarantaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es  qui \u00e9volue  dans le secteur du commerce de l\u00e9gumes.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Henrietta has many years of experience in this business.  Henrietta needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Henrietta joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Henrietta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

The group has 11 members, all from the area, and is represented here by Rubi.  Rubi is 48 years old and married with 4 children, one at university and one still school aged.  She has operated a business for three years, making and selling hats, sweaters, skirts and blouses among other things. She decided to pursue this line of work after she had the opportunity to learn tailoring at a local church.  They have worked with EDAPROSPO for 3 years.  The members operate a range of businesses: sales of prepared food, juices, sweets, and clothes.  Rubi is buying, with a recent loan, materials (fabric, thread, needles, etc.) to make the products she sells.  The other members will increase their capital so that they become more productive or gain a better position in the market or capture more customers.  The members have big dreams and goals and they are very grateful to the institution for the help it provides them.  All are committed to repaying their loans, continuing their businesses and acting in good faith.

This is what has motivated her to ask for a loan from INTEGRAL so that she can stock her store and satisfy a greater demand. With the loan she will buy things like rice, beans, corn, drinks, propane gas, etc. This is how she hopes to achieve her dream and give her family everything that they need.

from Tanzania! This is thirty-year-old Grace M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two young children. Additionally she supports a young relative who boards with her while she attends school in Dar. <P>Grace owns a video store that she runs with the assistance of her husband. In addition to renting out movie videos to customers, they also work as videographers. At occasions like weddings and birthdays, Grace and her husband are available to record your special occasion for posterity! <P>Grace currently makes monthly profits of US$ 110 from her video store. This is her second loan with SELFINA; she successfully paid back her initial loan of US$ 50 which has allowed her to request a far larger loan this time around. Grace would like US$ 350 to purchase new video cameras and blank tapes. She is hopeful that this will enable her to expand the scale of her business in the near future.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":191867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy video cameras and blank tapes for her video store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T00:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T01:57:48Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356201},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347943},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970517},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886734},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435994},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130292},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027123},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613163},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010246},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":40705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232557}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T01:57:48Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65177,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene M., 26 years old and single, is a hard-working young woman who has been sewing for three years.

Ismoil is a very responsible and optimistic person, and he has four children and a wife whom he has to support. Ismoil wishes to develop his business. This business consists of raising cattle in his village because there is a very high demand for milk from villagers and especially from customers who come from enclosed towns. Ismoil is helped by his wife, who is pictured. \n\nIsmoil is currently faced with many problems because his children are growing, and accordingly, their expenses are growing too. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities and the services provided by Imon International will help him improve his business.\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works in agriculture and also prepares lunch for the laborers that cultivate her farm.  Since she was a little girl, she learned to weed her farm using a machete.  Recently, she bought herbicides in order to kill the weeds that threaten her plants.  Since then, she hasn\u2019t use the machete as much, but after having applied the herbicide, she believes that the production of her banana plants has slowed, and the leaves are turning yellow.  She is worried about this and is looking for an immediate solution to restore the production of her bananas.  Despite all her difficulties, she is very happy with her farm and is considering increasing her productions so that she can grow alternate crops.  Mariluz is very happy to be a part of this community bank.  She has offered to help as a secretary, and also pledges to make her payments on time.

She says that she will use the loan that FUNDACI\u00d3N ESPOIR (Foundation of Hope) grants her to buy more chickens and guinea pigs which grow rapidly, as well as food and vitamins. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's dream is to see her children get ahead by the example that she gives them. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":412877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase more chickens, guinea pigs, food and vitamins","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789421},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789422},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679871},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679872},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074441},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074442},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074443},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910438},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910439},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946054}],"funded_date":"2009-11-03T00:10:16Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":151344,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 44-year-old married man with 4 children.

She manufactures children\u2019s clothing and needs a $1.500.000 loan to buy raw materials like fabric, ribbon, lace and thread at wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\nShe started her business in 1990 having learned to be a seamstress in Bucaramanga.  She was employed at a tailor shop but later became independent and currently works with her daughter, who does the cutting, and another worker, who does the finishing on the items and who uses her skills to decorate and adorn them, and with Susana who designs and sews; she works a long shift from 8am to 8pm because she adores her art.\r\n\r\nLuzalva M. sells by the dozen to customers in a shopping center near her shop called, Metrocentro and to customers located in colmenas (densely populated apartment buildings) in downtown Barranquilla.  Competition is high but she is preferred thanks to the quality of her finishing and her strict adherence to delivery schedules.  She buys most of her raw materials weekly but some of them like, details, buttons and decorations, every three days.\r\n\r\nThis is her 9th loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization she has been collaborating with for 12 years, both in loan programs and in training sessions.  Being tied to these processes has made it possible for her to modernize her equipment.  This is how she was able to purchase two over lock sewing machines (special sewing machines to do finishing on garments) and do some home improvements to her apartment.\r\n\r\nHer great dream is to set up a store in a prestigious shopping center but she knows that she must wait and continue to make merchandising efforts that will help her increase production and sales of children\u2019s clothes in order to generate at least one additional job.

S.

She has been selling cereals such as maize, beans, wheat and groundnuts for the last six years to the local people. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge is that there are so many people in the same business in her area and so customers are spoiled by the choice.

She lives in a house that she owns, together with her partner, Richard, who is 24 years old, and her beloved 7-year old daughter, Cledy. She wants to give them both a better quality of life. With a great deal of effort Nadya and her partner, Richard, have worked their land and they have made them very productive. She cultivates cocoa, coffee, and coca leaves. Once the harvest is done she takes the products to the collection centers in the cities of Santa Rosa and San Francisco for wholesale.  Her cultivations have provided her with enough funds to support themselves, which is why she wants to put her best into this business. The thing she most enjoys about her work is caring for her cultivations. She has 6 years in the business. The most difficult part of her work is having to transport her products, especially because the sacks are very heavy and she needs to hire help. She uses donkeys to carry the loads of products to the centers. With the funds that she requests she will purchase wheelbarrows to help transport her products. In the future she wants to buy ore land to increase production. This is her first loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). The loan that she requests will be of great help and she is happy with the introduction of the communal bank in her village. With the 1000 nuevos soles she will purchase wheelbarrows to help transport her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":753278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wheelbarrows to transport her products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-19T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nadya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":185.24},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":191.48},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200.18},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":206.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":216.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.47},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.8},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":69.47,"local_amount":185.24,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270230},{"amount":71.8,"local_amount":191.48,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":202.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550249},{"amount":74.07,"local_amount":197.53,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":208.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718924},{"amount":78.62,"local_amount":209.63,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-18T08:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":221.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350392},{"amount":81.04,"local_amount":216.12,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:37Z","rounded_local_amount":228.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850892}],"funded_date":"2011-04-19T22:15:23Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":295481,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a 39-year-old married woman with two children who are in school.

Center for Community Transformation (CCT) quickly responded to her loan application and she wants to thank them for being considerate every time she requested for one. Genuine appreciation she wants to send to all of the people used by God for the approval and assistances on her previous loan, CCT and all of the lenders.\n\nCristina is now able to earn an approximate amount of Php 4, 000 every month. She aims that the business will continue to operate and have a business expansion so that she can sell her products to other locations. Since the business helped her sustain their daily needs aside from the income earned by her husband. To buy added products for her business like: chicken and pork and beef, hams, and sausages on a daily basis is what she aspires, that\u2019s why she applied for a loan amount of Php 50, 000.

Farming is the major source of their income.\r\n\r\nEstrella is engaged in selling clothes, which adds to their income. She roams house to house in their village and in nearby villages to sell different clothes for men and women. Often, she goes to the distant place of Baggao, Cagayan where she is able to sell the most. From their business, Estrella is able to earn around PHP 2,000 (~$40) daily. She is thankful that she is able to maintain her business and through this, she is able to support the education of her grandchildren, who live with them. Estrella is active in developing her business and she is requesting to borrow a loan amounting to PHP 17,000 ($375 US). The loan will serve as additional capital to expand her business. She believes that by entrusting everything to God is the best step to succeed in every life\u2019s endeavor.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a spot at the poultry market of Wayerma I and is in high demand by his customers for the quality of his poultry.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy his burgeoning customer base, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first individual loan.  With this first loan, he intends to buy:  20 chickens, 20 Guinea hens, 10 pairs of turkeys, 5 pairs of ducks, and 4 geese.

He hoped to help improve his living situation and increase his ability to engage in business activities. Eddie is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Eddie from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
