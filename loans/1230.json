As the main source of income for her family, Rakhiya practices livestock breeding. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Rakhiya's hard work, she currently has 4 milk cows and 1 calf on her farm. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Rakhiya turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Rakhiya plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

","en":"Orunbu is 36 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising three children. Orunbu has a university education. As the main source of income for her family, Orunbu practices livestock breeding. She started this business 15 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Orunbu's hard work, she currently has three milk cows and 1 horse on her farm. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Orunbu turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Orunbu plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to build a new

children in J.Rumy. While her husband is away working in Russia, she stays at home and takes care of the children. Her husband has worked abroad for the past few years, and sends them money. Her children have grown up a bit, and now Miyansarpocho has some free time. She is not used to wasting time, and has decided to start her own business buying and selling cattle.

He is married and has four children. In his time, he was able to get a secondary education and even received a university education. Nevertheless, even with a college degree, Ziyoboy was unable to find decent work in his village. By virtue of this, he was forced to take a job as a guard at the local market. At that moment, he did not think about prestige, as he had to feed his children. Ziyoboy's wife also works to help her husband bring earnings home. She works as a cook at a local caf\u00e9. They do not earn a lot of money, but their sons also support them. Two of Ziyoboy's sons are working in Russia and they send their parents a good amount of earnings monthly. \r\n\r\nZiyoboy himself has worked with Microfinance Company Arvand over a period of several years. He has received loans several times to cover his needs and has paid back all of his loan obligations on time. Now Ziyoboy wants to marry off his son, which is why he requires the necessary funds for organizing the wedding ceremony. For this reason, Ziyoboy turned to Microfinance Company Arvand, this time to receive a loan to pay for his son's wedding. He hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for their financial support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1432122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to organize a wedding ceremony for his son.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-24T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-24T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ziyoboy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":89.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":93.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":103.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":114.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":116.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":119.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":122.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":125.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":129},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":132.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":140.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":609000,"name":"Sophiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophiah is 33 years old and sells clothes in the town of Tala.

He has a shop selling basic grocery products in a small public area. He started his business by working in a retail shop; that enabled him to save capital to open his general store. In addition to using his business for selling to customers, he also uses it to help older families so they don't have to go to the market in the city, and he attempts as much as possible to provide his customers' needs himself. \r\n\r\nNow, he would like to expand his business, but the wholesalers hesitate to provide him with the required goods, dealing with him as a lower-class person, which has become a challenge for him. In spite of that, he was able to return his shop back to usual, but he could not buy all the items he had before as he needs financial support. So, he applied for a loan of 100,000 YER (Yemen rials) from AMB in order to buy grocery items such as soft drinks, mineral water, etc., for his business. This loan would help to meet the demand of his clientele, bringing in all that they require.

In the year 2011, she formed a JLG with other members of her village to avail loan from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nKumudini has done tailoring and embroidery work in her house for nine years. She has one tailoring machine. Her younger daughter is helping her in this business. Kumudini and her daughter both know embroidery work. Besides the tailoring work, she makes toys, pillow covers, wall hangings in different designs, TV covers, filter covers, etc. She has a good number of customers. Peoples give orders for wall hangings for their new houses. Kumudini earns about Rs 6,500 in a month. \r\n\r\nHer husband does a private job with a monthly salary. According to Kumudini, this amount is not at all sufficient for her to manage the household expenditure as well as business expenses. So she wants to expand her business to earn some extra income. This will be her second cycle loan. With it she wants to purchase new cloth, threads and one Pico machine. Kumudini has a long desire to have an established cloth store with embroidery at Muniguda and gain name and fame in her locality.\r\n\r\nBesides Kumudini there are five other members in the group. Three members - Ayesha, Bharati and Kalyani -- need a loan for a readymade dress shop, a fast food hotel and a tailoring shop, respectively. The other two members - Prabhati and Jhilli -- both need a loan for leaf plate wholesaling.

Her husband works abroad. She is a homemaker and lives with her son. Her son is 17 years old and studies at school. Zarrina worked for several years as a Russian language instructor at a medical college. Now she stays at home and sews and embroiders custom curtains. Zarina's mother taught her this trade. In their family, all of the girls were expert homemakers - they all were expected to know how to sew, cook, clean and manage all of the household tasks. Zarrina's mother raised her well. Four years ago, when Zarrina stopped working and became a homemaker, she was not sad about it because she knew what she would do to support herself. And, believe me, there has not been a day when she has felt sorry for herself. She had no idea that sewing curtains and thinking up different patterns for them would give her such satisfaction. \r\n\r\nZarrina is requesting a loan to purchase a computerized sewing machine. With the assistance of the received credit, she will be able to replace her old machine for a new, computerized sewing machine. She won't have to repair this machine all the time and she will be able to sew without technical malfunctions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1436313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Each one of us is good at something, has some sort of talent. But not everyone can find this within themselves and materialize it into a reality. \r\n\r\nSaid was able to find his calling in life when he was 26 years old and he took it very seriously.  He became an engraver. His initial works were unoriginal and simple, but he put his heart into them. Now his engravings are unmistakable, as they are full of refinement and individuality. He can work on them for hours on end. Said has combined business with pleasure. He engraves the sides of traditional baby bassinets, which are called \"lyulkas\" in Tajikistan. His son constructs the lyulkas, he engraves them, and his wife paints them and gives them color. It is a family pastime and a family business. \r\n\r\nSaid is requesting a loan to buy wood, paint and varnish. Said hopes that this amount will be enough and that he will be able to materialize his ideas on new bassinets.

She is a single mother who has managed to look after her two children with the help of a sister. She sells foodstuffs and charcoal to the people staying in her neighbourhood as her business. This business has helped her a lot and it is from it that she managed to buy land and put up a simple house on it. \r\n\r\nWhen she gave birth to the baby she now has, her business destabilized and she now has only a little capital since she could no longer go to the villages to purchase charcoal to stock, yet she was pulling out money from her working capital. Because of this problem, she is opting to borrow UGX.1,500,000 to restock her business and be able to meet her customers\u2019 demand as before.\r\n\r\nShe has hopes of servicing the loan well so that she will be able to apply for more money as soon as she finishes repaying this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1431340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy stock of charcoal to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bombo Road","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-09-24T15:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-24T15:10:09Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983952},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429636044},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863479},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752548},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233532},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468058995},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479276863},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490973490},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504414581},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":154376.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692212}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T22:17:51Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T17:48:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":609053,"name":"Al-Rahma Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Al-Rahma Group has four members, all of whom work in small businesses where they live in Aden, Yemen.

With profits from his farming Simon wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'They offer loans through groups that co-guarantee.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense are school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit her family', Grace replied 'More income will educate her children.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Grace owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

57 years old. She is a widow. After her husband\u2019s death she has been raising her children and managing her farm on her own. Kulyumkan has completed a technical college. As a main source of income for her family, Kulyumkan raises livestock, having launched this business 37 years ago by buying livestock for 2,000 KGS. Thanks to Kulyumkan\u2019s hard work, her farm today includes one dairy cow, one  mare, and 10 sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Kulyumkan has turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 135,000 KGS in order to expand her livestock by buying cattle. Kulyumkan plans to use the resulting revenues for a further increase of her livestock. She also plans to save up for house renovations.

She earns a living selling food at her home which is situated in the area of Villa F\u00e1tima, and she is also starting to sell clothing. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the institution. Rosmery is going to use the loan to buy merchandise such as seasonal clothing for her new business which is selling clothing to order. She is asking for the loan because of a lack of cash. Rosmery faces challenges in her business because of her age, since she now needs more time to cook and prepare the food. For this reason she only does this at the weekend. She will use the profits to buy clothing now that she can put more effort into this new business she is starting up. She will enjoy the profits she will get from the new business. \r\n\r\nRosmery's hope is to consolidate the business so she can support herself from it and look after her daughter and grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1438733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Because of the lack of employment opportunities her family went through a difficult economic situation.  Eager to generate income to support her children she decided to start her own fast-food business on the sidewalk where she lives.  She started a year ago with saving she had and gradually gained experience to better manage it and as a result her clientele has grown.\r\n\r\nShe works every day starting at 3pm and on weekends; her older son helps her.

She started a business selling food products at a leased pavillion in 2004, using an initial capital of 5,000 som (KGS).  Having been able to grow her business and to obtain regular clients, Amina now has an average monthly income of 7,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Amina's hard work, she was able to increase her product turnover and develop her business.  In order to further grow and expand her business, Amina requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to increase product turnover by buying food products wholesale to be resold at retail prices at the pavillion.  Amina plans to invest the earnings from the loan into the product turnover and save money to purchase a house for her

He and his parents are involved in making national types of bassinets.  Rahmatullo creates cradles from wood, and his parents decorate bassinets with engravings and paint.  You can see one of these creations on the photograph.  Rahmatullo followed his father's footsteps, who has been involved in creating and decorating bassinets for over 25 years.  Previously, Rahmatullo simply helped his father and it was just a hobby for him, but now he knows that he wants to be involved in this business for life.  He will use this loan to purchase wood and create newer models of bassinets."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1437680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

He runs a Zoona Mobile money transfer business in Chililabombwe. This is Richard\u2019s second loan from Kiva; he sent in this update to his Kiva lenders and wanted the lenders to know this about him:\r\n\r\nMy name is Richard, I am widowed and have two lovely daughters and am currently living with one in Chililabombwe in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia.\r\nGenerally, I would say my business has not performed as expected. But with the help of the first Kiva loan, I made sure that much of the commissions earned were saved separately. I have since cleared the first loan. From the savings, I managed to pay for the Mobile Booth and got two more operations after an extensive surveying in the Copperbelt Province.\r\nThe greatest challenge I am facing now is the working capital to enable me to operate effectively. It is for this reason that I am applying for the second Kiva loan, so that I can top-up my working Capital to help me serve more customers. One thing I hate is to turn away Customers for the reasons that I do not have enough cash or the banks are closed. I have been with Zoona since 2009 and have helped some to join the business.

Since her husband's death, she has been single-handedly raising three children and tending her own farm. Begaiym has a secondary education. Animal husbandry is the family's primary source of income. Begaiym started this business 25 years ago with cattle she bought for  400 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Begaiym's farm now has two milk cows, one calf, five sheep, two lambs, three goats, and five kids. She earns a monthly income of 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Begaiym asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 135,000 KGS to buy calves for cattle breeding. Begaiym plans to use income from the loan to further increase her cattle.

She recently joined a campaign to improve the community's sanitation and hygiene through her local Women's Union, where she has been a member since 1983.  With this loan, Lan will build a hygienic toilet that will improve her family's quality of life.  A group of 10 neighbors, including Lan, are requesting a loan to install toilets at each of their homes.  This means the community as a whole can avoid the common diseases and infections associated with the unhygienic latrines they are currently using. *Please note, the person on the far left is not a

Two years ago she opened her own business with the support of her oldest son. As an option to generate an income and employ her time in some activity, she opened a beauty supply store in which she works alone every day from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm. There, she offers a variety of beauty supplies like dyes, cosmetics, nail polishes, shampoo, and hair treatments, among others. \r\n\r\nThe client is an active and thriving woman. She is throwing herself into reaching her goals, which is the reason for which she decided to take the loan to support her continued progression. The money will be invested in the purchase of supplies wholesale (dyes, hair treatments, nail polishes, cosmetics) and costume jewelry accessories.  Thus, she will be able to obtain the items at a lower cost and will be able to offer a larger variety of products, which will be seen reflected in the increase of the profit margin that she obtains from each sale, giving a higher income level as a result. In this way, she will have the option to improve her personal finances and will avoid depending on her children who have economically collaborated with her for many years.\r\n\r\nCarmen wishes to continue working arduously to arrive at the completion of her dream of accrediting, strengthening, and growing her business to the point of opening more stores, which will generate more profitability and where she would be able to offer business opportunities to more head-of-household women. In this way, she will improve the quality of life as much for her family as for other people who have influence in this line of work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1438859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies wholesale (dyes, hair treatments, nail polishes, cosmetics) and costume jewelry accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-24T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-24T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107105},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110068},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113113},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116241},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119457},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122761},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126157},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129646},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133232},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136918},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140705},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144597}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.59,"local_amount":100484,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101345.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095613},{"amount":57.97,"local_amount":108695,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":109626.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074663},{"amount":60.68,"local_amount":113780,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":114755.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009861},{"amount":129.62,"local_amount":243025,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":245108.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523467},{"amount":61.22,"local_amount":114779,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":115762.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480244870},{"amount":67.19,"local_amount":125978,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":127057.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855617},{"amount":140.09,"local_amount":262666,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":264917.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520982754},{"amount":229.64,"local_amount":430593,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":434284.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595189753}],"funded_date":"2013-10-23T22:09:31Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:37:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":609110,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience is married with six children.

Selmita\u2019s work consists of the sale of grocery products. She has a small store in her home, where she also offers some products from catalogs for her customers, the majority of whom are her friends, neighbors, and relatives. She also possesses a motorcycle taxi that she rents to a trustworthy person. \r\n\r\nShe has been working all types of jobs for more than 18 years. She has worked alone since her husband makes a living in agriculture and spends much of his time on his farm.  What she likes about her work is that she can make money while being in her home, spending time with her son who on some occasions also goes out to work on the motorcycle taxi that she has. In her neighborhood her grocery store is very crowded since she treats her customers well and has everything they need.

He goes out very early and returns home for lunch, and then goes back out again at 2 to continue working.\n\n\nHe is requesting this loan to buy herbicides and fertilizers for their 17,500 square meters of corn. The investment will help them combat pests and diseases in their crop and increase their yield.\n\nHe dreams that his partner's business will grow and that he will make a good income selling corn so that he can pay for his children's schooling and they can have good careers one day. He plans to use his profits to invest in his partner's business, to buy tables, chairs, and kitchen tools, and to leave a little money for the next planting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1432692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy herbicides and fertilizer for his 17,500 square meters of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-25T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-25T00:00:05Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":288.71,"local_amount":288.71,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":288.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622376},{"amount":310,"local_amount":310,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":310,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903340},{"amount":1.29,"local_amount":1.29,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215628}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T23:37:17Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:13:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":612209,"name":"Silvia Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Silvia vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida e hijos.

Kossick","image":1845905}},{"id":612038,"name":"Beatrice's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Mulundu village in Kenya, Beatrice has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser. She is a friendly, hardworking, trustworthy, and well known member of the community with 4 children who are 22, 21, 14, and 9 years old. She lives in a house with mud walls, a concrete floor, and an iron roof house with her grandchild. Beatrice works as a maize and beans farmer and is an active member in her community, especially the women's group.\n\nMulundu village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Beatrice and the 25 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nBeatrice has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. She volunteered to be the promoter to assist the community to grow and to help prevent water-borne diseases. Someone in Beatrice's family has suffered from water-borne diseases in the past and she wants to prevent this from happening again in the future.

He is the father of a son; he expects that he will have more children in the future. Now his family\u2019s expenses are very low, which will not remain constant in the future. Ahmed has compared his current monthly income with the rapid increase in inflation and concluded that his earnings will be lacking to cope with inflation in the future. So he decided that he should increase his business so that he can easily fulfill the household expenses and can provide comfort for his family.\r\n\r\nAhmed\u2019s business is selling crockery. Through the sales of crockery items such as plates, dishes, cups, jars, glass, jugs, mugs, and buckets, he earns sufficient income for his family. He has been selling stylish crockery in the main market for many years. He also provides fancy crockery for dowry to his customers. The marriage season impacts a positive change over his sales and he earns maximum income in the marriage season.\r\n \r\nAhmad is not a landlord, he is just an ordinary person. He has been establishing his shop with efforts days and nights. He does not have enough savings to buy fancy crockery to offer his customers. He is taking loan to invest the full amount in the current business. He assured us that he will show his good payment behavior because he wants to take more loans from BRAC Pakistan. \r\n\r\nAhmed presents his humble request to Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan,

","en":"There are some professions that require a lot of time and hard work and sometimes there's not enough time left for the family. It's very hard for people with such professions if they have a home, family and children. It was also hard for Abdukarim. He worked as a truck driver driving Kamaz. Abdukarim did not want to separate from his loved ones for a long time and transferred to another job. Right now he works as just a Kamaz driver and transports freights in his region delivering fuel. Abdukarim has a lot of time left, but he does not waste it. He does animal husbandry at home. Most of the residents in Tajikistan do animal husbandry and field crop cultivation. Abdukarim hopes that his work will bring him profit and using that he will repair his home. He is taking out the loan to buy small horned and large horned cattle such as goats, sheep, two cows and calves.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1436010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is 48 years old. He is a married man. He has four children: two sons who are 10 and 19 years old and two daughters who are 16 and 20 years old. His wife and daughters are homemakers and his sons go to school. For twelve years, Rustam has worked as a cook preparing ethnic dishes. He mainly cooks delicious Tajik plov (a Central Asian rice dish). In his free time off from work, Rustam decided to start doing animal husbandry, along with his job as a chef. The idea for two simultaneous jobs came from his brother, who has bought and sold livestock for several years now. He will help Rustam in the beginning, so that Rustam can easily start his own business. Rustam is taking out a loan to buy two calves, three cows and a bull-calf in order to start raising cattle at home.

This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas, with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region. \r\n\r\nSolomon is married and has two children. Both he and his wife work as teachers, with Solomon teaching at a local primary school. Solomon also farms his land and grows maize, beans and bananas as well as trees on his plot. \r\n\r\nThis is Solomon\u2019s first loan with Kiva, and he is grateful for this opportunity to own hives for honey production. Solomon hopes to learn from this experience and educate his pupils on the importance of beekeeping, since, as an agriculture teacher, he understands very well their role in the ecosystem.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7.02,"image":{"id":1433867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.

Now he travels to trade in the village, since at  present, he lives in the urban sector.  \r\n\r\nJose has his principal customers in the zone where he lives, and these are mainly stores and nearby neighbors from his barrio.

He requested a loan of $4,300 to purchase cows. The Start Up program, a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, gives him a chance to obtain a business loan.

He is 31 years old and lives in Shahrituz, Tajikistan. Sayyohidin has been growing crops since he was 17 years old. He plants onion and wheat on his land. His wife helps him, but his children, although they want to help, are too young.
