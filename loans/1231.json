He is happy, outgoing, and has an infectious smile. So when Alexis found himself unemployed last year he decided to start a business for himself. Why depend on more short term work when he could follow his dream of running a small business, and create employment for others while doing it?\n\nThe primary means of transportation for most Rwandese is the matatu, a mini-bus taxi that is often overcrowded and overloaded with cargo. Most of these buses are very old, and with a lack of proper maintenance and second-hand parts, they are very dangerous on Rwanda's curvy, hilly roads.  Alexis saw that the cost of repairs deters owners from properly maintaining their matatus, and set his sights on finding a way to make the repairs more affordable and, in turn, the buses safer.\nEarlier this year, Alexis started an auto shop to provide repairs and spare parts to the bus companies. In addition, he has partnered with a local vocational school to hire graduates from its auto repair program. With Alexis these students will receive a full time job\u2014rather than a low-paid apprenticeship\u2014and will provide Alexis with highly skilled technicians.\n\nRight now, Alexis's business is small, but he has finally secured a deal with his first large-scale client to provide spare parts for their entire fleet of buses. This $10,000 loan will give him the working capital to service this client and hire two auto repair students from the next graduating class, giving Alexis the capacity and credibility he needs to bring in other big clients and grown his business in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1439637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":["Growing Businesses"],"use":"To hire two employees and secure a new large-scale client.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":319,"posted_date":"2013-09-25T21:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-25T21:00:20Z","loan_amount":10000,"lender_count":283,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":10000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10000,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-04T10:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":10000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429411708}],"funded_date":"2013-09-27T02:43:37Z","paid_date":"2014-01-04T10:06:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":611933,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to increase his stock of staple goods.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2013-09-25T21:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-25T21:00:20Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20945},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21683},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22420},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23157},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23894},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24631},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25369},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26106},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26843},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27580},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28317},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29055}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.64,"local_amount":20945,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T09:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":21208.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419757832}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T01:05:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meredith Rogers","image":1118725}},{"id":609260,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys is 61 years old and works selling smoked fish.

The businesses these women have include selling ice-cones, embroidery, tortillas, catalog items, and a small store.  \n\nClarita Florentina (3rd from left) is 26 years old and migrated to San Miguel Due\u00f1as from another part of the country because of the lack of opportunity in her hometown.  She is married and has three small children, one of whom is in school.  The others are still too young to go to school.  She and her husband rent their home.  She runs a small store, and her profit from this store is the largest source of income for the family.  She opens the store at 6 AM and closes it at 10 PM.  \n\nBecause of her inexperience in the business world, her store has struggled in the past.  She is looking forward to the financial education and business advice that Namaste will provide to her along with her loan, so that she can do a better job of handling her money and managing her store.  With her loan, she intends to buy fruit, fruit juices, and other items that her customers want which she does not currently have in the store.  Currently, her profit is around $357 USD and her dream is to work up to a profit of about $800 with her new skills and the additional supplies she plans to buy.

She tells us that for a year she has been making a living selling chickens as a street vendor in the Los Cux hamlet.  On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays Liria does not go out to sell chickens but works washing and ironing clothes.  Liria is applying for this loan because she needs to buy chickens on credit.  The lorry that comes round selling the chickens sells on credit but, on many occasion, the chickens have been injured and die.  So, Liria prefers to buy on credit and can choose which ones she takes and make sure that they have not been injured.  Liria also wants to help her children, who are studying, including one who is working for his degree, which costs more.  Liria's husband does not earn enough to cover all the costs so Liria is applying to Fape and Kiva for a loan.  The other member of the group is Mar\u00eda Ruth.  She is a single mother and has three daughters.  She has been selling traditional clothes for fifteen years.  She also does dressmaking and makes different kinds of blouses to sell.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1439754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is a variety store owner, and he is also a Jeepney ( a popular form of mass transit) operator. His loan also helped in the education of his children. As he increases his loan, his income also increases which he used in their household expenditures.\r\n\r\nHe would like to apply for another 60,000 PHP loan for him to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to his inventory. The more items displayed at the variety store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. His profits from his business will definitely help him to sustain their daily needs and the educational expenses of his children. He looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in his heart.\r\n\r\nServando dreams that he will be more successful in his business, and hopes that his children will finish their studies. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week, and also to draw strength and inspiration from the study of the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Guatemala, chose the name Ebenezer for their group because they are mostly Christian, and Ebenezer means \u201cUntil now God has helped me.\u201d  They formed the group because two of their friends had been in the Namaste program.  The women of Ebenezer saw with their own eyes how the business advisor, business education program, and loans provided by Namaste helped their friends to improve their businesses.  These women are now eager to start learning for themselves how to better manage their own businesses and how to control their expenses.  Some of the women in the group cannot read or write, and their average education level is 4th grade.  They all have several children and some of the women are the only support for their family.  The average age is 38 and the oldest is 55.\n\nMarta Lidia (on the far right) started her store, which is pictured above, one year ago with approximately US $90.  She was able to reinvest in the business because her husband helped her with household expenses.  Then he lost his job and they started having to use the money from the store to feed the family and send two of their three children to school.  Their third child is still too young for school.

It is made up of four ladies who work together in different areas in Sana`a, Yemen. This is a group of women with initiative, values and good proposals on how to conduct business nowadays. They requested a loan of 200,000 YER from AMB. \r\n\r\nLinda is 32 years old and a married woman with three children. She is a merchant; specifically she sells new clothes for adults and children, according to the season. She sells her products from her house. She buys her merchandise from distributors and stores where the prices are cheaper. \r\n\r\nShe began this activity as a result of selling her business from home. With the income from her business, she was able to upgrade her home and enjoy more comfort. At the present time, her business doesn't get her as much profit due to the bad situation in Yemen. So she applied for a loan of 50,000 YER from AMB to acquire articles of clothing such as dresses, shirts, pants, skirts, shoes, etc. She will sell them to her customers, thus giving her the opportunity to improve her income from her business. \r\n\r\nOne of her personal dreams is to send her children to private high schools.

She is the mother of five children.  Part of her house is still under construction   because she does not have savings to complete the remaining construction. \r\n\r\nHer husband owns a clothing business.  His practice is to buy fabrics from wholesalers and sell them to retailers. He has built up a good reputation in the market.  Due to the large numbers of customers, the demand for fabrics is increasing day by day, but he does not have sufficient money to buy more fabrics.\r\n\r\nTherefore Azra has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can be able to buy more fabrics to fulfill the demand. She is in her sixth loan cycle and has shown an excellent repayment behavior.  She has already taken loans from BRAC and invested in the business. \r\n\r\nAzra hopes that her savings will much increase, and she will complete the remaining construction of her house.  She dreams of a bright future for her children, of building the business, and of a better standard of living for her family.\r\n\r\nShe is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1433872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He would like to invest in the purchase of cedar and palo blanco woods for production.\r\n\r\nRoberto has been selling through NOVICA since 2011. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"When I was 11 years old I walked into a wood workshop and asked the owner to teach me the carver's craft. My desire to learn was very strong, and I was motivated by my ambition to be the best and of course, to help my family. It hasn't been easy to establish myself as a lone artisan, but my wife's support encourages me to constantly renew myself as an artist. I believe it is important to showcase the handcrafted nature of wood carving, and that's why I take time to teach. I don't want to see this art form disappear. I also stress the importance of working with certified woods and being conscious of preserving the environment. In fact, we have participated in reforestation campaigns to ensure green and healthy forests. I am so grateful to the Lord for allowing me to achieve what I wanted. I have a workshop I can leave to my children, I have a good job, and I try to instill in others the example of hard work, will and honesty that my parents taught me.\"\r\n\r\nA message from Roberto: \"Thank you all for the opportunity of this microcredit so I may keep producing.

For knotting carpets, different kinds of natural and synthetic fibers are used, namely, wool, cotton, jute, and viscose. Carpets are woven by hand on a structure called a loom. There is no better kind of the carpet than a carpet made by hand, though this is far from implying that all hand-tufted carpets are superior to all machine-made ones. Traditionally, carpets are woven on wooden looms. The carpet is generally woven in a warp, i.e., a chain of vertical threads, fixed almost vertically in front of the weaver.\r\n\r\nHer husband is very expert and knots very fine carpets. This is a very slow and time-consuming procedure; he knots carpets over nights. This is the reason her husband can sell at a high price, but the problem is that the customers do not always agree over the demanded cost. The demand for fine carpets has been increasing from time to time.\r\n\r\nHer husband wants to buy more raw material for knotting carpets, but he does not have enough savings to make this purchase possible. Therefore Rubi has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that she can buy raw materials, such as polyester, wool, cotton, jute, and viscose fibers for knotting carpets.  The loan should cause her husband's income to increase. \r\n\r\nNote: Rubi raises her hand in the picture. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1434109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy synthetic fibers, namely wool, cotton, jute, and viscose, for knotting carpets.

This area has a cold climate, wide grasslands, and green countrysides which, combined with the rugged terrain, make for beautiful scenery. The local people, including the group members, are traditionalist and maintain the customs and traditions that their parents taught them. They work in animal husbandry, agriculture, and much of the population travels daily into the city to pursue different activities. \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Segunda. She finds herself pursuing her second loan alongside her friends and companions from the San Lu\u00eds de Cumbe credit group. She likes being a part of this group as everyone is very accomplished and supportive. Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Segunda is 49 years old, married, and through her conjugal union has 7 children. Five of them are married and live independently, one daughter lives at home to help with the household chores, and her youngest daughter is attending school in the city. Her husband works as a mason, and they own their home.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Segunda sometimes works as a day labourer, but her main income source is cattle breeding, through which she sells milk. She also raises pigs, guinea pigs, and chickens. What she gets from her agricultural work is for her household, but if there is a surplus, she sells it.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the money from this loan in the purchase of a calf and in feed for all of her animals. Her goal is to raise better quality livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5050,"image":{"id":1439865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a calf and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-09-26T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-26T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":5050,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario Gonzalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Etelvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Segunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Segunda Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5048.16,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":420.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1262.5,"local_amount":1262.04,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1262.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857999},{"amount":841.67,"local_amount":841.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":841.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506368},{"amount":841.66,"local_amount":841.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":841.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730125},{"amount":841.67,"local_amount":841.36,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":841.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636206},{"amount":841.67,"local_amount":841.36,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":841.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102632},{"amount":420.83,"local_amount":420.68,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":420.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467917574}],"funded_date":"2013-09-30T20:17:00Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T12:26:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristen McNeill","image":null}},{"id":609622,"name":"Cristina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cristina is 57 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nCristina works hard to provide for her family.

Her husband works as a construction helper.\r\n\r\n12 years ago, seeing that her husband did not earn much in his job and that his job was not secure, Rosa told him to build her a small shed in which she began to raise chickens. Over time she has expanded her chicken operation and currently has up to 400 chickens per season. The season lasts two months, by the end of which time the chickens are ready for sale.

She started working as a freelance deejay, but being a female, she was constantly faced with challenges because audiences were skeptical as to how good she could actually be. These challenges, coupled with the fierce competition she faced from others, got in the way of Dila\u2019s goal of becoming a professional deejay.  She jumped back into the job market, but still held onto her dream of one day becoming her own boss.\r\n\r\nA couple of years ago, Dila began to help her friend with her spray tan business. She would occasionally assist in providing in-home spray tan services for customers who preferred to tan in the privacy of their own homes. After doing this work several more times, she found it very interesting and most importantly, with this job she was at an advantage as a female because most of her clientele were women. Over the next couple of years, Dila gained experience and built a solid customer base. \r\n\r\nShe has now decided that it is time for her to start her own sun spray tan business. Her goal is to own her own tanning salon and become a successful entrepreneur. A $2,500 Kiva loan will help her attain the required licenses and capital needed to purchase the equipment and material to start her

She shares that her alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until she could return. For Yolanda, it is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Yolanda plans on purchasing her much-needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Yolanda feels she will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. In addition to her responsibilities at school, Yolanda currently works 30 hours a week as an office administrator and earns $3 a day. With a degree in systems engineering, she expects to earn $10 a day. \r\n\r\nWith two older siblings attending college already, Yolanda is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her

Her husband is a driver by profession and provides transportation services using his three-wheeled rickshaw. He has been driving a rickshaw for many years to meet the family expenses; from time to time, it requires proper maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. But this time the maintenance costs will exceed his savings. For this reason, Lubna has applied for a loan for her husband. He wants to buy new tires and do some needed engine maintenance for his vehicle. This will help him drive more smoothly and provide better transport service for his passengers. \r\n\r\nLubna is hopeful that this loan will be a productive one for her husband and will bring positive changes to his business. Lubna is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

of Mongolia. The family resides in an old brick house on a plot of land. Her husband went to Korea on a three year employment contract in October, 2012. She has been working as an assistant cook at a kindergarten for the last two years. Her elder daughter goes to high school while her youngest attends kindergarten. This summer, she began to renovate their house but due to lack of finances, she couldn't finish it in time. So she is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam. After making repair and insulation using those materials, her family will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place without worrying about the upcoming winter. Also, the family will burn less coal for heating because of insulated walls thus, releasing less pollution into the atmosphere.

This group of women trade in various items such as fruit and vegetables, cosmetics and others.  \r\n\r\nTo improve the scale of their businesses, the members of Djekafo have decided to request a loan from the field partner Soro Yiriwaso. This will be the first loan for this group.  \r\n\r\nDjenebou (second person from the right) only sells cosmetics.  She will use her loan to buy boxes of creams, perfumes, toilet soaps, pomades, lotions and nail varnish.  She buys these products in bulk in Koutiala, from the Yoruba people.  Djenebou makes retail and cash sales from her home, and at the market.  She has a diverse range of customers.  \r\n\r\nWhilst the other members of the group hope to make an average profit of 62,000 francs CFA each during this period, Djenebou expects to make 70,000 francs CFA.  As well as repaying their  loans, they will use part of their profits to fund their day-to-day, personal expenses, and increase their stock levels.

They are, on average, 30 years old, married, and with an average of 3 children.  This group of women buy and sell various products such as fruit and vegetables, cosmetics, fabric and others.  To improve the size of their businesses,  the members of the group have requested a loan from the field partner Soro Yiriwaso.  This will be the group's first loan.\r\n\r\nAwa (on the left of the photo) will use her loan to buy sacks of soaps.  She uses drivers to buy this product in Abidjan.  Awa makes retail and cash sales from her home and at the market.  She has a diverse range of customers.\r\n\r\nWhilst the other members of the Ladiri Group hope to make an average profit of 55,000 francs CFA each during this loan cycle, Awa hopes to make a profit of 60,000 francs CFA.  As well as repaying their loans, they will use part of their profits to pay for their day-to-day personal expenses, and to increase their stock levels."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1438758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy soaps.

with his recently created magazine, \"The Rouge Collection\".\r\n\r\nBased on his agenda to display everything that is \u201cred hot\u201d within the city, Gary created the mag 10 months ago in efforts to revamp the industry. Financed from personal funds, Gary expanded his business and was recently able to purchase office space for production with hopes to break through Baton Rouge boundaries and connect to readers outside his town.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of The Rouge Collection is to share photos and articles that highlight everything positive happening in Baton Rouge along with the people behind the positive events and include places worth visiting. Gary\u2019s new goal is to receive articles from fresh writers with fresh perspectives, ideas and concepts to shape the future of the mag. \r\n\r\nCurrently, The Rouge Collection is in high demand for samples and orders but, due to lack of equipment and supplies, Gary is unable to execute large orders and sample requests. Failure to complete orders could result in closing the business. As new as his business is, it was no surprise to Gary that he would eventually need financial assistance. A quick Internet search introduced him to Accion Texas Inc., a nonprofit microlender with America\u2019s largest lending portfolio, and ended his worries. Once approved, Gary set out to purchase office equipment to print product samples.\r\n\r\nWith his recent loan, the 28-year-old was able to continue his service to his hometown, keep his four part-time sales employees, and continue to educate his readers on relationships, health and fitness, style and beauty, entertainment and sports.

The more you get to know me, (the more) you will understand how passionate I am about this!\u201d \r\n\r\nTodd says his family history of health issues increased his need to discontinue use of traditional cigarettes and find a new outlet. Once he made the switch to vaping and experienced the difference, Todd began spreading the word. He noticed he could make a business out of the work he was already doing. Realizing the need for inexpensive, high-quality vapor supplies and accessories in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, Todd went to work opening Zooks Vapor.\r\n\r\nBeginning his business seven months ago from his own money, Todd hopes to one day open a store and attract more customers and hire a team instead of working alone. Before he can accomplish his next goal, Todd ventured to community partner SCORE, which then referred him to nonprofit microlender Accion Texas Inc. Now approved, Todd expects to replenish his inventory according to his clients\u2019 wants.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis loan will help me not dig so much into my pockets to support the business.

He is the father of four children.

He purchases broken doors, windows, and all damaged iron accessories and sells them to a recycling factory. Sometimes he finds some repairable accessories and those products give him high resale value. Some customers sell their broken iron accessories and do not consider them repairable. Ishfaq repairs such types of accessories and resells them at high prices. In this way he gets high prices in his scrap dealing business. His main source of income is to sell and purchase scrap iron goods. He always keeps searching for houses under construction to buy scrap iron from ceilings, pulled doors and windows. Through this practice he can easily find repairable doors and windows for resale.\r\n\r\nA few months ago his elder daughter was married and he spent a lot of money over her dowry. Recently, he found a house under construction and the owner is selling the iron goods, but he does not have sufficient amounts to buy the scrap iron. Therefore, Ishfaq requested a loan so that he could buy scrap iron and could make rapid increase in his income.\r\n\r\nIshfaq hopes that this loan will enhance his earning capacity so that he would be able to make more savings than earlier. Ishfaq seems very glad after taking this loan and says thank to Kiva and to its field partner BRAC Pakistan. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1434914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy scrap iron goods for resale.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 20,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nSemiona dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes to make a better living.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and  draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is a farmer and works hard from Monday to Saturday so that day by day he can earn a living  with much effort. Milton tries to get ahead and in spite of the difficult economic situation, he remains persistent and constant in his work. \r\n\r\nHe is a responsible young man and has many ideas in mind. One of them is to make some changes at his home. He wants to cement the entire front hallway because it's really dusty.

With time and a lot of perseverance to move forward, she was able to begin selling new clothing.\r\n\r\nThings were going poorly for a while because her mother-in-law was very sick, which cost a lot of money since she had to travel a lot to be able to be with her mother-in-law. But with the help of her husband and her savings, she was able to move past this.\r\n\r\nNow, she needs money to be able to stock her business with more clothing, since she has not had the money to purchase anything. \r\n\r\nThe thing that she likes the most about working with Fondo Esperanza is being able to work in a group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5650,"image":{"id":1440461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She has educated several generations of students; many still remember her and talk warmly of her. As a main source of income for her family, Tynar raises livestock, having launched 40 years ago by buying cattle for 3,000 KGS. Thanks to Tynar\u2019s hard work, her farm today includes four dairy cows, two calves, and 30 sheep. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Tynar has turned to the \u201cBai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 60,000 KGS to buy cows to increase her cattle headcount.

may never be possible. Jahaziel was accepted into the Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Boliviana and now, with the chance to achieve her dream, is concerned about affording tuition fees. She expects to graduate in December, 2015 but without a loan is unsure how she will be able to continue affording her education. Her alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until she could return.\n\nJahaziel shares that it is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible. Jahaziel plans on using the loan to cover the cost of her tuition. To help pay for her education Jahaziel currently works 25 hours a week as a waitress. One of her biggest challenges has been making time to work and focus on her studies. With a career in engineering, she expects to earn $34 a day, a substantial increase from before. With one younger brother, Jahaziel hopes to be a role model for her younger sibling by being the first in her family to graduate from university.

Thankfully, they live in a house that is humble but their own. She is a very driven woman who always wants to do what is best for her mother. She has been improving her home little by little but at this time she still needs to pour cement on the floors and repair a wall. That is why she has requested a loan from FUSAI, so she can pay for labor and construction materials like bricks, cement, gravel, iron, etc. She works and is very responsible, which is how she is backing repayment of this loan. She hopes to pay it off as soon as possible. That would make her feel happy and satisfied.

This business is Ra\u00fal's source of income for supporting his son and covering his costs of living.\r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan, Ra\u00fal plans to purchase merchandise in bulk to stock his caf\u00e9-bar, including liquors, coffee, soft drinks, snacks, etc. He also plans to make some improvements to the caf\u00e9, including repainting the walls and other areas. He hopes that this investment will give the business a fresh look and will increase the variety of products he sells so he can attract more customers. In turn, he hopes these changes will also lead to increased sales and income, allowing him to improve his quality of life and better provide for his son. Ra\u00fal is well aware that he needs to continue working hard in order to fulfill his goals of growing and strengthening his business and increasing its notoriety in the region.

She works on the farm for an average of seven hours per day and she also does trade which is her other source of income. She does the business in her local cell of Nyakanyinya and she started the business with a motive of getting money to help her earn a living. She would like to use the money (six hundred thousand shillings) to buy fertilizers and produce and she has hopes of buying a big piece of land for her agriculture business in the near future.

As he works in an area that is always busy, he has been able to make the most of his business as there is a lot of demand.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Amadou Thierno plans to buy those goods which sell the quickest, such as sugar, milk, tea, soap, etc. Despite his age, he was quick to take responsibility for the daily expenses, and he is the one who provides the food and pays for his children's education.
