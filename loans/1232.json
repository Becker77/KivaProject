This is the region with coffee, tea, and dairy farming. Its also the region that has had a lot of problems with deforestation, hence there have been water shortages in the recent years. Lilian is no exception from the millions of women who use wood and dung fuels for cooking and kerosene for lighting. Their income levels can not enable them to install and sustain electricity energy. The situation is not easy now that the forests are reserved and therefore getting wood is becoming harder. Like her neighbors, she has to suffer every weekend walking up and down the hills to go fetch water and collect wood to last her a week so that she can till the land during weekdays.\r\n\r\nLilian learned about VEP and the biogas project during a training at her church, and determined to resolve the fuel issue she approached VEP to help her construct one at her home. She has received a biogas loan and started the life-changing project that will see her and her family become empowered with cleaner, cheaper, and more efficient fuel. This will also save her one day in her weekends to rest and be with her children. The biogas will also supply her with light so she will not need to buy kerosene anymore. This will be good for her children who need to study in the evening and can now enjoy more study hours. We believe this will improve their grades. With the monthly income from tea and the sale of milk from her three cows, Lilian will be able to repay the loan, and once she clears she hopes to purchase a water tank to store rainwater and solve her water problem as well.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1435128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

She is a farmer and a business lady operating a small shop next to her house. She joined VEP in 2012, and since that time she has been able to benefit from renewable energy, having bought her first solar lamp and cleared her debt. Happily, she shares with us how much she has enjoyed life while using a solar lantern that helped her save at least 50% of the money she previously used on kerosene. The lamp she bought could be used in the sitting room for her children to study, during dinner and for the master bedroom. She would then only need to buy a little kerosene for her kitchen lantern, which the children would also use in their bedroom. \r\n\r\nFor this loan, she would like to take a solar package that comes with four lights so she can have light in every room, charge mobile phones and power their small radio. The other older lamp can then be used in the shop to serve the evening customers instead of using a candle. This way she can open her shop for longer hours. With the package she will not have to buy kerosene anymore or pay to have her phone charged. This means a lot of savings for her and convenience for her family.

of land and by tailoring clothes. She is 34 years old and has three children to take care of. Her business, which she has had for 12 years, has enabled her to generate almost 32,000 KHR per day. With this new loan, Mom will be a fifth-time borrower whereas her co-borrower will be a six-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The positive impact of Mom's past loans has enabled her to repay her loans and to support her living better than before, especially in purchasing household appliances and three meals a day for her family.

She obtained a crop yield of 50 quintals which she sold at a very good price and was able to repay the loan.  Profits were very good and she reinvested part in her crops and the other was used to buy certified potato seed from a nursery which she was able to get to plant.  She was also able to do some home repairs building a brick wall at home that was indispensable in order to divide a room.  Her business changed because production improved thanks to the first loan.  So did her quality of life because income earned were as expected, they even surpassed her expectations in fact.  Therefore, this time she\u2019s decided to request a second loan to plant the seeds she now has in larger amounts and to be able to prepare the soil once again for the new product because it\u2019s

She is married and has one son. She was never able to formally work, but necessity obliged her to begin working at raising chickens for meat. She loved this work and still does it.  In addition, in the afternoons, she sells pupusas, a traditional stuffed tortilla dish.\r\n\r\nShe built a small hen house in a space in a hallway in her home. She covered the sides with plastic sacking from the chicken feed to be sure that the other animals didn't get in and bother the chickens.

She has one young daughter (making 3 of them in the house) who is in the 2nd grade at primary school.  Her income and economic sustenance comes from coffee, since the land and climate where she lives are well suited for growing it.  Not only her family but many other families rely on it for income.  The land where she and her husband farm is owned by them and was inherited from her parents.  It takes 45 minutes to walk there from her house.  Occasionally, her brothers help out by tending the crop and also by harvesting.\r\n\r\nNelsy has big dreams which include become a major coffee producer, exporting her crop to other countries.  By so doing, she would create jobs within her community and also increase her children's inheritance by buying more land and growing more coffee.  In addition, she hopes to support her daughter's education and give her the opportunity to go to college to prepare for a professional career.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, she is asking for a loan so she can start turning her dreams into reality.  She will use it to maintain her crop and protect it from pests, among other things.

Since the yearly years she has been helping her parents work with livestock and knows this craft very well. She started buying and reselling cattle three years ago and continues to grow cattle for future resale. She is from the Zafarobod region. A large part of the residents in the region do animal husbandry and grow cattle and produce milk. At this time Shahlo only has one milk cow and a calf. She wants to use the loan money to buy a couple of calves and increase the headcount of livestock. Shahlo is positive that everything will come out alright because her son and husband always help her. We wish her success in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1440398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

His parents needed him to help them with their agricultural activities and this is how he learned from his father how to raise livestock and grow food. He is married and has three children. His wife is a housewife.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is currently working on 14,000 m2 of corn and 7,000 of plantain, and has eight steers. Every day, after taking his animals to graze, he goes to his plantations to clean them and get rid of plagues and weeds.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 needs to walk one kilometer to buy animals. He walks through the sugar cane fields, from his house to the main street in his community, where he takes a truck that takes him to the market, 45 minutes away.

She lives in the Caldwell area in Montserrado County. This area is becoming one of the more populous communities in Montserrado due to some factors such as good roads, quietness, and lower housing rents. Bendu is single with two children aged 3 and 5. They live at home, and only one is currently attending school. \r\n\r\nOver that last 3 years now, Bendu has been running a table-top shop selling copy-books, pencils, pens, etc. in the local market. She sells from Monday to Saturday for 9 hours each day. Her main challenge is the rainy season, but she makes more profit during this time. She started this business selling with her mother from whom she learned the business. She is requesting a loan to purchase more copy-books, pencils, pens, etc. for her business. She plans to build a house and educate all of her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1435367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office

married and mother to 6 children whose ages range from 11 to 26 years old. Three of these children still go to school. She has been a shopkeeper in a market in the capital for 16 years already, where she sells fresh foodstuffs (plantains, manioc [cassava], yams, palm nuts) according to the seasons. Her business is doing well, but nevertheless has the problem of insufficient merchandise with respect to demand because her capital hardly allows her to satisfy this clientele which is growing more and more. Thus she is requesting this loan again in order to be able to buy her foodstuffs in large quantities which will allow her to avoid permanent stock shortages and equally to satisfy and increase her clientele and consequently her profits.

He is responsible and goal-oriented, and is thinking seriously about the development of his business. He bought 10 acres of land and wants to plant half of the irrigated area with potatoes, and the other half with wheat. Kiromiddin previously worked as a tractor driver and is knowledgeable about working the land; his many years of experience will help him in this undertaking. \n\nWith these intentions, Kiromiddin applied for a loan with MDO Humo. The loan will be used to buy wheat and potatos. Kiromiddin can be confident as he prepares for autumn planting because there are people in his life who will always come to his aid - his wife, his children, and his brother. He is also hopeful, and he thanks you for your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1439201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wheat and potato seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-09-27T12:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-27T12:50:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kiromiddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":556},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":556},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":556},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":556},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":556},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":556},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":556},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":556},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":552}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.76,"local_amount":556,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":556.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449683029},{"amount":933.24,"local_amount":4444,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4449.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459152745}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T20:27:17Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:46:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie M","image":null}},{"id":610078,"name":"Sadia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!

She is married with 5 children between the ages of 10 years and 27 years old. Two of her children are currently attending school. In 2008, Yamarie established her wood business. She began her business because she needed to establish a source of income to support her home. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that her business is doing well, because she is able to earn enough for her daily meal from the profit. Yamarie requires a loan in order to purchase wood for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Eleanor plans to open a grocery shop. She thanks you for your

The group consists of five micro-entrepreneurs from Brazzaville, Congo. Ernestine is married with nine children whose ages range from 16 to 35 years old. She is very excited to be receiving her fifth loan from HOPE Congo after having successfully paid off her previous loans. She has had her business for around 28 years. Her business consists of selling auto parts and supplies. With this next loan she plans to buy more brake fluid, which is very much needed by the many taxis in Brazzaville. One of her strategies in her business has been selling in bulk to owners of multiple taxis. With these regular customers, there is less risk of having a bad month of sales. With future profits Ernestine hopes to further diversify her inventory as well as construct a new home for her family.

The group consists of eight micro-entrepreneurs from Brazzaville, Congo. Marcelin is married with four children, ages ranging from 3 months to 27 years old. He is very excited to be receiving his second loan from HOPE Congo after having successfully paid off his previous loan. He has had his business for around seven years. His business is a general store, selling many different items including beverages and medical supplies. With this next loan he will concentrate on buying large cases of mineral water and milk.

","en":"Rustamjon is 34 years old. He is married and has one daughter. Rustamjon is a master repairman for apartments. But now is not the season for his activities. Typically, residents of Khujand do repairs only in the spring and summer when it is hot. Rustamjon does repairs only on request. \r\n\r\nNow it is autumn and the orders are gone. In autumn and winter, he does not have work, so he decided to start a new business in wholesale trade of mobile phones. In starting this business, he will be helped by a relative who is engaged in this sphere. Rustamjon does not have experience in this sphere, so he does not want to risk it and is borrowing only a small amount. The amount of the loan is small for a wholesaler, but he hopes that it will be enough to start the business. \r\n\r\nRustamjon hopes for the best and we wish him good luck!

She is a widow and has the pride of having supported her children until they were grown and independent. Since she was very young, she grew up in an environment where farming was the main sustenance of many families in her community, since she grew up in the bosom of a humble household. Years later, upon getting engaged, she started to work independently and rapidly acquired her first piece of land in order to earn income producing and selling organic cacao. It was in this way, at the side of her husband, that she started to plan many long-term goals. After the death of her husband, she found it necessary to assume a double maternal role.\r\n\r\nHer main work consists in maintaining in optimal condition the cacao crops she has on the 2 hectares of farmland that she owns. She usually hires workers who help her with the tasks of weeding, harvest, and applying organic fertilizer. She likes her work very much, since it is work she has done all her life. Nevertheless, on many occasions the climate and other natural factors make her productive work difficult. This is her first loan with Kiva, and she hopes to have the confidence necessary to move forward. She also promises to move forward.

She is a widow and has five children. She and her children manage their household while operating a variety store business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her children will always be in good health. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

From an early age she learned the demanding task of working the land and now she has the large responsibility of supporting her two children. At first she had the solid support of her husband but after their separation she started to work independently.  She now works with the help of her parents. \r\n\r\nNidy is knowledgeable about various agricultural activities like the production and maintenance of organic cocoa, which is one of the products her family has traditionally grown. Being a very proactive person she has managed along with her parents to have a very good growing season, using day labor to carry out the various tasks. She has pushed the using of organic fertilizer like guano to obtain a higher quality harvest. \r\n\r\nWith the passing of the years Nidy has come to think it convenient to purchase a small plot of land and start the production of cocoa of her own. She hopes to improve her economic situation and she comments that she hopes to be able to offer her children a good education so they can be better people.

area of Kabwe District, Zambia.  He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine so that he can provide a milling service to over 100 families in his community. \n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia.  Most rural families in Kabwe District grow maize on their small farms and store it to use as their primary supply of food for the year.  After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima.  Edson is already a well-respected maize and dairy farmer in his community and wants to expand his business to offer the maize milling service. \n\nRent-to-Own has done market research in Edson\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal.  The closest maize mill is 20km away, but is often broken down.  This means most potential customers have to travel more than 30km to a nearby town, and since most will walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. \n\nEquipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost for many enterprising farmers such as Edson, as it allows for him to diversify his business.  Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill are very prohibitive.  Once he secures a loan, Edson will be able to get a maize mill from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. \n\nThis loan will help Edson on the path to building up a viable business that can provide for his family and community throughout the year.  It is for this reason Edson is asking Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure a maize mill as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1441008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to obtain a maize milling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kabwe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-09-27T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-27T17:20:09Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":13200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5810}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":378.79,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429616078},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":772.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841797},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":2310,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2318.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490950592},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":772.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517890712},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":772.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530168244},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":772.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542647769},{"amount":776.52,"local_amount":4100,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-01T11:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4115.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561782472},{"amount":189.39,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-27T09:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595307793},{"amount":134.48,"local_amount":710,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-27T09:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":712.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611948935}],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T02:35:42Z","paid_date":"2015-03-27T09:52:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":610324,"name":"Elisapeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisapeta is a 59-year-old widow with 5 children.

Mar\u00eda's dream is to make her business a profitable source of income that will allow her to have the financial stability she needs to keep ensuring her children's wellbeing and to offer them a better quality of life.

ella en su casa propia. Hace mas 20 a\u00f1os se dedica a cultivar la tierra con el firme apoyo de su esposo gracias a un peque\u00f1o terreno que hered\u00f3 de sus padres y que le sirvi\u00f3 para obtener sus primeros ingresos y adquirir las 2 hect\u00e1reas de terreno que posee actualmente. Comenta que al iniciarse tenia mucho temor ya que tampoco contaba con dinero suficiente  para la compra de insumos tales como abono org\u00e1nico y menos para la contrata de trabajadores vi\u00e9ndose obligada junto a su esposo a  trabajar muy duro a pesar de tener a sus primer hijo en brazos. Su labor principal consiste en brindarle le mejor de los cuidados posibles a sus plantaciones de caf\u00e9 que tiene alrededor de sus terrenos ya que a diferencia de otros productos rentables de su zona requiere los respectivos cuidados para lograr una buena calidad comercial en la cosecha. Es por ello que fertiliza sus suelos solo con abono org\u00e1nico. Considera que la labor mas complicada es la cosecha de los granos cafeteros ya que es un trabajo que realiza contratando trabajadores para su posterior pelado y secado al aire libre. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva y espera contar con la confianza necesaria para invertir en sus parcelas. En est\u00e1 oportunidad desea contar con 3,000 nuevos soles para la compra de abono org\u00e1nico para fertilizar sus cultivos de caf\u00e9.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda is 49 years old. She is married to Justiniano and has four children who live with her in her home. She has been cultivating the land for over twenty years with her husband's steady support thanks to a small plot of land she inherited from her parents and that served her to obtain her first earnings and acquire the five acres of land she currently has. She says she was very afraid when she first started because she didn't have enough money to buy supplies like organic fertilizer, let alone to hire workers, so she had to work very hard alongside her husband, even though she had to carry her first child in her arms. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of her work is tending to the coffee crops she has surrounding her land as best as possible, because unlike other profitable products in her area, coffee requires specific care in order to achieve good commercial quality at harvest. That is why she only fertilizes her land with organic products. She considers picking the coffee beans to be the most complicated part of the process, since she has to hire workers to later peel and air-dry the beans. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva and she hopes to have the trust she needs to invest in her land. This time she wants to have 3,000 nuevos soles to purchase organic fertilizer for her coffee crops.

While he works, his wife, Mukarram, cares for their son and daughter. At the moment, Abdugafor has too few jobs lined up, so he wants to do other work. His friend invited him to work as a videographer at weddings and various other events. Abdugafor knows how to use a camera, but he does not have a video camera. Therefore, he is asking for a loan to purchase a camera. With the camera, he will be able to get an interesting and lucrative job. We hope that he will succeed because he is always trying to do what is best for his family.\r\n

This is Qu\u1ebf\u2019s first loan with the Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. She will use her portion of their group loan to purchase baby poultry to raise and sell in the future.

His town is very populated and most of the crowd belongs to India. Many people like to chew betel leaf, so a few years ago he decided to open a betel leaf shop, to offer various kinds of betel leaf products to the people. He offers betel leaf in several kinds of mixtures -- for example, 'sweet paan,' (which consists of betel leaf mixed with chopped or coarsely ground areca nuts, mint, coconut, fruit preserves, 'gulkand,' or rose petal preserves, and various spices) and 'tobacco paan' (which consists of powdered betel leaf mixed with tobacco).\r\n \r\nHe is an expert in preparing 'paan,' because he has been running this shop for many years, and a lot of customers like to chew betel leaf products that have been prepared by him. In addition to betel leaf products, he offers cigarettes of different brands.\r\n \r\nM. Nadeem is 36 years of age and the father of four children. He has only a single source of income to support his household. For the growth of his business, he wants to start offering cold drinks, soft drinks, and mineral water. His customers demand cold drinks also, which was part of his decision to offer drinks. But he does not have a refrigerator for the preservation and chilling of drinks, or savings.\r\n\r\nTherefore, M. Nadeem requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan. He will use the loan to buy a refrigerator and cold drinks to sell. In this way, he will succeed in winning the trust of his customers and getting more income at the same time. His family's needs are growing day by day; with the additional income he will earn by using the loan he could easily cope and handle critical situations, too. M. Nadeem is very thankful to Kiva and hopes that the Kiva lenders will support him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1436014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to add a new business line to his shop, by buying a refrigerator and cold drinks to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2013-09-27T20:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-27T20:20:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M.
