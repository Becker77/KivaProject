He cooks delicious Pakistani food such as biryani, qorma, roast chicken & fish and in sweet dishes he prepares firni and kheer. He is a very famous chef in his town and most of the people like to purchase food for their ceremonies from him. With his chef services he provides crockery as well. \r\nDue to continuous usage most of the crockery has broken or is scratched. He wants to buy new crockery for his chef business. Due to his household expenses he does not have a sufficient amount to buy crockery. \r\nTherefore, Rubina requested for a loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband would be able to buy new crockery.\r\nRubina is the mother of 5 children; his sons also work but do not financially cooperate with her. \r\nRubina is very thankful to BRAC Pakistan for this honorable favor.

With years of experiences in the retail and sales industry, Christine noticed a market for antique books, furniture, art and other related items and went into business in 2010. As passionate as Christine is for the work she does, the shop temporarily closed after two years because of a decline in business. \r\n\r\nIn April 2013, Christine decided to reopen the business, this time focusing on used and vintage literature, art and handmade goods. \r\n\r\nFinanced through her personal investments, Christine knew the second time around she would need to accumulate monetary assistance outside of her pockets. She turned to Accion Texas Inc. \r\n\r\nThe nonprofit microlender with America\u2019s largest lending portfolio became Christine\u2019s second source of income to balance her business. After approval, she used the loan to establish her business, finance the rent for a new location, acquire equipment and inventory and have enough money left for operating costs. She is hopeful to make more profits than she did previously.\r\n\r\nWith her newly purchased cash register, laptop, paper, ink, shopping bags, books, bookmarks and other inventory, Christine has access to an economical way to advertise her business and generate sales. \r\n\r\nTo view the art, books and other items Christine has in the store, feel free to check out and like her Facebook page

","en":"Chehron is a young man living in the Vakhsh district of Kurgan-Tyube together with his mother and two sisters.  He is a modest, independent and bright 19-year-old who is in his second year at a state university in Dushanbe.  Every year, Chehron pays more than $2000 USD for his tuition; his mother helps him pay for his schooling, as in Tajikistan, it is customary for parents to fund their children's education.  Chehron's mother and sister both work as seamstresses, selling the dresses that they make in a store.  In this way, Chehron's mother is able to earn money and provide for the family.  He helps his mother as well whenever he has free time.  This year, Chehron is $1500 USD short of making his tuition payment; he is seeking a loan from Humo so he can continue his studies, and looks forward to your help.

She and her husband are raising five children. Nazgul has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Nazgul raises livestock, having launched this business 19 years ago by buying cattle for 6,000 KGS. Thanks to Nazgul\u2019s hard work, her farm today includes two dairy cows, one horse and four goats. Her monthly income is 9,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, Nazgul has turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 70,000 KGS in order to increase her headcount by buying cattle. Nazgul plans to use the resulting revenue for a further increase of her livestock. She also plans to save up for a car.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1441098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Felicitas farms for a living on a hectare and a half of land that her parents gave her because she did not have the financial resources to take care of her children.  After 15 years in the field, she has been able to consolidate it as her main source of income.  At first she had the help of her husband, but since their separation she has relied on the help of workers from the area whom she hires for complicated jobs, such as clearing weeds and applying organic fertilizer to her crops.  She has a considerable amount of cacao trees that provide her with good profits at the end of their planting season.  The part she likes most about her work is splitting the pods and extracting the cacao nibs, which are dried by hand and then taken to the capital of her district where she gets good prices for her produce.  This is her first loan with Kiva and she is thankful for the financial support she has received to get ahead.  She also promises to make her payments on time.  She currently needs 1,000 nuevos soles to buy organic fertilizer.

She has been working in agriculture since she was 20 years old alongside her husband, with whom she was able to acquire half a hectare of land and grow several organic cacao trees as well as coffee, among other things. After the first year of work, she was able to earn her first income, starting out as a producer and working to benefit her small family. After several years of working with her husband, they separated due to exceptional circumstances, and she had to support her family by herself. Currently she has two hectares of crops where she expanded her cacao plantings and fruit trees. She is proud of having advanced her older children, who today are independent and very hardworking. For carrying out her work day to day, she is used to having the necessary supplies like fertilizers and tools to adequately care for her assorted crops. One of her main goals is to continue working with her characteristic motivation to support her youngest son in his higher education and improve her home. This is her first loan with Kiva and she hopes to have their support to move forward. She also promises to make her payments on time. On this occasion, she hopes to receive 500 new soles to buy tools to make her work easier, like machetes and pruning shears, among others.

He grows bananas, corn, pipian squash, and other crops. His day starts at four in the morning. He milks three cows, then takes them to the field. To do this, he walks 20 minutes to the place where he keeps them. In the afternoons, his son collects the cattle. The loan will be used to buy five calves to graze, in order to take advantage of the winter grazing, and he will buy three sacks of fertilizer to fertilize the banana plants.

Besides this she takes care of the two cows they have that produce the milk that they consume in their household. \r\n\r\nBlanca will use this loan to buy a bag of seeds, six bags of fertilizer, two gallons of herbicide and pay for manpower to do the seeding. Her dream for the future is to leave her children a house, not the wattle and daub one they currently reside in. She wants her children to finish their studies and also that they end up owning at least 5 milk cows.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1439740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a bag of seeds, six bags of fertilizer, two gallons of herbicide and pay for manpower to do the seeding.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-27T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-27T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Mirian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":830,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":830}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":498.8,"local_amount":487.06,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":498.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818185},{"amount":351.2,"local_amount":342.94,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":351.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243684}],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T18:12:07Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:20:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":610423,"name":"Sivai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sivai is a 43-year-old married woman with three children.\r\n \r\nShe has a small plantation and grows taro, tamu and banana to earn a living.

During his working life he has always been an independent shopkeeper.  Nine years ago he started a video game business that also sold merchandise, which produced very good results and led to him being recognized in the community.  This allowed him to open a second business two years ago that offers internet service, sells minutes and recharges cell phones, sells cell phone accessories, and provides repair services for cell phones.  He works every day from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and when he has a lot of work to do he hires someone to work with him.  He takes advantage of being located in a very commercial neighborhood, which is why he has gotten excellent results that have generated a lot of income for his family.  He is known for being a hardworking, organized, strong, and disciplined man who works painstakingly so his businesses will grow.  He is asking for this loan to help him invest in stock (cell phones, recharge cards, SIM cards, cell phone accessories).  This will allow him to increase his sales, as he will have a wider variety of products available and cell phones with modern technology, which will satisfy the needs and demands of his customers.  The result of this will be an increase in his profit margins and better viability.  Luis wants to keep working hard so his family will not face any financial hardships and so his children can get and excellent education and have a better quality of life.

He is married and has 2 children who are both now independent.  His wife is a homemaker, and she is the only one who now lives with him.\r\n\r\nEver since he was very young, Jose has liked farming.  He used to go with his father where he had a plot where he cultivated corn, and this is where he learned how to farm.  Today, he is a farmer and cattle trader.

She is a widow. After her husband\u2019s death, she raised her children alone. She also has been running a farm on her own. Burmakan has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Burmakan raises livestock, having launched this business 27 years ago by buying livestock for 5,000 KGS. Thanks to Burmakan\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes three dairy cows, four heifers, one horse and one goat. Her monthly income is 16,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, Burmakan has turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance bank for a loan in the amount of 80,000 KGS to increase her headcount by buying cattle. Burmakan plans to use the revenue from her loan for an additional increase of her livestock. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1441101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jyluu-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":109.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burmakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":618.75,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":30141.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053344},{"amount":575.62,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":30141.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":43.13,"payment_id":579488617},{"amount":346.41,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":20094.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":66.09,"payment_id":636160942}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T04:14:00Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:41:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":610481,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine has been a poultry farmer in the town of Kangundo for the last year.

Following the death of her husband, she alone raises her 6 children and tends to her farm.  She has a high school education, and the brunt of her income comes from raising livestock, having started 10 years ago with 12,000 somoni worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, her farm currently has 1 dairy cow, 1 bull, and 1 calf.  Her monthly income is 8,000 somoni.  To further develop her farm, Mirzaim is seeking a loan in the amount of 120,000 somoni from Bai Tushum & Partners to buy more cows for her farm.  She plans to reinvest the additional income that the loan will allow her to buy even more livestock.\r\n\r\n

She is mother of six children and living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\nShe has been running a business selling clothes for many years. She purchases a variety of clothes from the main city and then sells them to the people of her vicinity. She has become famous for selling good quality clothes in her community. She has spent all of her money on household expenses and does not have any money left to buy stocks of clothing. \r\n\r\nShe requested a loan from BRAC to buy stocks of different clothes for the winter season because the winter season is going to be starting soon, by taking into account the choices and tastes of her customers. In this way, she would be able to earn more income through her greater sales. She hopes to have a good experience with this new loan and wants to grow her business. \r\n\r\nRehana is in her 4th loan cycle with a good repayment history. She dreams of giving a good and quality education to her children through all her hard efforts in her business. Rehana says thanks to Kiva and to its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Javahir, with the help of her daughter, is breeding livestock including cows and hens. They are also cultivating alfalfa, tomato and watermelon. Livestock breeding and plant cultivation are very important sources of income for the family. To be able to continue it, Javahir needs a loan of USD 1,500 to purchase fertilizers and feed for the livestock. Javahir has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Javahir was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Javahir and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their

Ahmadjon has been dreaming for his own herd of cows for a long time. Right now he has a chance to make it a reality. He hopes that he will succeed at taking care of cattle. He is not afraid to take on additional work because he knows he can manage all of the responsibilities. Even though Ahmadjon has never been in this business he is moving forward with confidence because he knows that his neighbors will always be there to help

easternmost town of Mongolia. He has been rendering transportation service to local people since 2011. His son is a policeman and works at the town police department. This summer, he demolished his former house as the house no longer provided his family with appropriate protection. Immediately he began building new house on his former house's foundation. But due to lack of finance, up until now he didn't complete building work and his family is currently residing in a Mongolian traditional ger which lacks necessary protection against snow and storms. So he is requesting a loan of 2000000 MNT to purchase building materials such as bricks, cement and planks. Using those materials, he will be able to build his new house before winter. The house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating and release less pollutants into the atmosphere.

It is made up of eight members and is managed by a Board where Juana is the president. The businesses that the members of the communal bank undertake are varied, including blanket weaving, selling vegetables, selling milk and cheese, and running a neighborhood store.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they have taken out will help micro entrepreneurs such as Juana; she states that she became a member of Pro Mujer six months ago, entering at the invitation of a promoter of the institution who came to visit her in her home. She currently has a business selling milk and cheese, which informs us that she learnt this trade several years ago as it is a family business. After getting married, she decided to start her own sales area. \r\n\r\nThe loan that will take out now is to increase her working capital (to buy calves) that she will purchase in the agricultural shows nearby her community and later on to rear the calf and produce products that she will sell in her sales area. This form of work will enable her to generate an income to support her home as much as possible as she is married and has three children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what it is that she likes about Pro Mujer, she replies that she likes the training in health and loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1441371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy baby calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T12:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T12:00:01Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Escolastica\tGuillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Ismael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2773.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2802.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2878.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2956.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3120.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3205.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3226.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":401.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":405.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":428.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":439.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":451.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":464.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":467.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":807.29,"local_amount":5575.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5578.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153744},{"amount":416.78,"local_amount":2878.52,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2879.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615317},{"amount":428.14,"local_amount":2956.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2958.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736257},{"amount":439.81,"local_amount":3037.56,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3038.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641767},{"amount":451.78,"local_amount":3120.16,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3121.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108703},{"amount":464.09,"local_amount":3205.28,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3206.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923770},{"amount":467.11,"local_amount":3226.06,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3227.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144633}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T19:59:04Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:31:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":610539,"name":"Jargalsaikhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Jargalsaikhan, 47 years old, lives with his wife and two children in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia.

Do\u00f1a Ade tiene un invernadero desde hace ya nueve a\u00f1os esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito  a VisionFund y Kiva para poder comprar m\u00e1s semillas de cilantro, jitomate, zanahorias, lechuga, etc. Necesita del dinero para poder adquirir su material y continuar sembrando hortalizas; sin su cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil comprar semillas que su costo se ha elevado mucho. Do\u00f1a Ade platica como adquiri\u00f3 su invernadero \u201cA m\u00ed siempre me ha gustado el campo, siempre quise tener un invernadero sin embargo no ten\u00eda el dinero suficiente para construir uno\".  Para la estructura de un buen invernadero se necesita de un buen capital, comenta ella, \"...pero no me quede con las ganas de sembrar verduras: arm\u00e9 un peque\u00f1o huerto con material desechable como palos delgados y algunos costales ya viejos para poder cubrir mis hortalizas\". Do\u00f1a Ade siempre trabaj\u00f3 con mucha dedicaci\u00f3n para obtener buenas cosechas, pero un d\u00eda tuvo la oportunidad de poder pedir un invernadero fue un apoyo por parte de un programa del gobierno. Para Ade, esta noticia fue muy agradable, el solo tener ya todo la estructura la cual es muy cara la hizo muy feliz. Do\u00f1a Ade tiene ya nueve a\u00f1os con su invernadero en el cual siembra toda clase de verdura por varios meses ella se dedica a trabajar muy duro,  para despu\u00e9s vender su verdura con sus vecinos nunca le ha gustado salir a vender en las plazas ni en los mercados. Con su venta le va muy bien porque sus vecinos le compran toda su mercanc\u00eda, muchas veces ya no tiene que salir a vender porque llegan a su casa a comprarle. Sin embargo, el \u00fanico reto de Do\u00f1a Ade es la falta de agua para poder regar sus plantas, en la comunidad donde ella vive est\u00e1 prohibido utilizar el agua potable y cuando llueve capta toda el agua posible para utilizarla como riego en su invernadero. El verdadero problema es en tiempo de sequ\u00eda muchas veces teme perder toda su cosecha. La meta de Ade es poder sembrar en cantidades grandes para poder vender o entregar a los se\u00f1ores directamente que se dediquen a la venta de la verdura, tambi\u00e9n desea llegar a tener un local propio en un lugar m\u00e1s c\u00e9ntrico para ella misma vender su verdura. \n\nAs\u00ed como Ade tiene sue\u00f1os los miembros del grupo tambi\u00e9n quieren cumplir los suyos es por eso que est\u00e1n solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para invertir en sus negocios: Bibiana en juguetes para los dulces de algodones, Juana en conejos, Ines en pollos y guajolotes, Luis en su taller, Irineo en avena, Andres en taxis, Martha en tienda de abarrotes y Virginia en ropa. El grupo Pe\u00f1itas se encuentra en una comunidad muy hermosa lo que caracteriza sus arboles grandes tambi\u00e9n por lo general hace siempre hace mucho frio siempre, el grupo est\u00e1 integrado por 11 personas las cuales son muy trabajadoras y responsables siempre tratan de estar muy puntuales con para cualquier situaci\u00f3n que se tenga que hablar con su grupo el nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque as\u00ed se llama la comunidad donde pertenecen y al parecer est\u00e1 en la lengua mazahua.","en":"Do\u00f1a Adelina or Ade, as she is better known, is a very hardworking and very enterprising woman who is characterized by her kindness. She is part of the group Penitas, is 31 years old, and lives with her common-law husband Sixto . Together they have formed a family with three daughters who are all in school. Ade has had a greenhouse for the past nine years and is currently requesting a loan from Kiva and VisionFund to buy more seeds of cilantro, tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, etc. She needs the money to be able to continue planting vegetables. Without the loan it will be difficult to buy the seeds because the cost has risen sharply. Ade tells us how she acquired her greenhouse: \"I always liked working in the fields, I always wanted a greenhouse but had not enough money to build one.\" For a good greenhouse structure, she needed good capital , she says \"... but I still wanted to plant vegetables. I built a small kitchen garden with disposable materials like thin sticks and some old sacks to cover my vegetables .\" Ade always worked with great dedication to get good crops, but one day she had the opportunity to request a greenhouse from a government program . For Ade, this news was very welcome. Just having the structure (which is very expensive) made \u200b\u200bher very happy. Ade has had this greenhouse for nine years and she grows all kinds of vegetables for several months. She works very heard and then sells her vegetables to her neighbors as she never liked going out to sell on the streets or in the markets. Her sales are very good because her neighbors buy all her merchandise. She often no longer has to go out and sell because they come to her house to buy. Nevertheless, the only challenge Ade faces is the lack of water to irrigate her plants. In the community where she lives it is prohibited to use the drinking water for crops so, when it rains, she captures as much water as possible to use as her greenhouse irrigation. The real problem is that in times of drought she often fears losing her entire crop. Ade's goal is to plant in large quantities to sell or deliver directly to her customers She also wants to have a stall in a more central location from which she can sell her vegetables.  \r\nAde has dreams and the other group members also want to fulfill theirs and this is why they are requesting a loan to invest in their businesses: Bibiana will invest in toys for cotton candy; Juana in rabbits, chickens and turkeys; Ines Luis in her workshop; Irenaeus in oats; Andres in taxis; Martha in a grocery store; and Virginia in clothes. The Penitas group is located in a very beautiful community that is characterized by its large trees and by the fact that it is usually very cold. The group consists of 11 people who are very hardworking and responsible and who always try to be very punctual in any situation where they need to get together and talk. They chose the name of their group because it is the name of their community and it is in the Mazahua language. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":1441299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more seeds such as cilantro, tomato, carrots, lettuce, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":4125,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irineo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":54000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1546.88,"local_amount":20250,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20250.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991823},{"amount":1031.25,"local_amount":13500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13500.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644470},{"amount":1031.25,"local_amount":13500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":13500.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877931},{"amount":515.62,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6750.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766964}],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T20:45:13Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":613744,"name":"Sergio Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sergio es un joven muy trabajador, labora en una peque\u00f1a empresa de transporte de carga y filmaciones de eventos, cada d\u00eda Sergio trabaja alrededor de 9 horas al d\u00eda y los fines de semana puede trabajar hasta 12 horas, ya que filma en los eventos; Sergio cree que est\u00e1 saliendo adelante porque es responsable y le gusta su trabajo.\n\nSergio est\u00e1 muy agradecido con los prestamistas kiva ya que gracias a la ayuda que le han brindado el podr\u00e1 realizar los tr\u00e1mites de su t\u00edtulo universitario, ya que el logro estudiar la carrera de administraci\u00f3n, as\u00ed el podr\u00e1 buscar un mejor empleo y mejorar sus ingresos, y seguir luchando para hacer realidad su gran sue\u00f1o:\u201d Tener un mejor empleo y ayudar a su familia\u201d\n","en":"Sergio is a very hardworking young man, he works in a small business  dealing with cargo shipping and the filming of events.

city of Mongolia. The family resides in an old house on a plot of land. He has been working as a general manager at a consulting firm for one year. His wife is unemployed and looks after her children. He is requesting a loan of 7,700,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam.

The business has helped him educate his children and construct for them a good shelter.  \r\n\r\nWilberforce would like a loan of 2,000,000 UGX to buy a generator to pump water in his plantation and fight against the dry season, which has left many people in tears.

Only one child goes to school.\r\n\r\nHe started cattle fattening in 2005 and he operates in a rural area. He began this business because he wanted to utilize the small piece of land that he has.

He has been driving a rickshaw for many years to meet the family expenses, but it is usually in poor condition and now it requires repairs and maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Shehnaz has contacted Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband repair his rickshaw. With the loan funds, they will repair the engine\u2019s piston, replace one wheel, and pay for labor. This will get Shehnaz's husband back on track with his business so he can drive more smoothly and provide functional and improved transport services to his passengers. \r\n\r\nShehnaz is hopeful that this loan will be a productive one for her husband and will bring positive changes to his business.\r\n\r\nShehnaz says thank you to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

Gabriela works some eight hours each day and, in the evenings, heads to classes.  She believes things are going well because she is a responsible young woman.\r\n\r\nGabriela is very grateful to Kiva lenders as, thanks to this support, she will be able to pay her monthly university fees.  She will thus have no problems going to classes, and will continue to fight to make her dream a reality: \"To finish my degree and become a great professional\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1441403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay monthly university fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":65.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":75.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":77.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":94.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":99.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":102.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.53,"local_amount":65.41,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":67.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054866},{"amount":26.03,"local_amount":69.42,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":72.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819791},{"amount":26.64,"local_amount":71.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":73.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472708},{"amount":28.16,"local_amount":75.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":77.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695177},{"amount":28.93,"local_amount":77.14,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":80.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450391196},{"amount":240.71,"local_amount":641.89,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":666.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067657}],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T17:29:48Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T09:57:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":610623,"name":"Noor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noor is 38-year-old woman.

Unfortunately, there are no facilities in her house for providing classes to her students, so Anna has applied to SEF for the help. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nThe loan will greatly assist Anna to purchase tables, chairs and notebooks and will make her work with students comfortable and effective.

He lives with his wife in the capital city of Georgia. Besik and his wife are unemployed now. His relatives help them with money. In the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make living. So, he decided to start a taxi business with the loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. His credit requests were rejected several times, as he was unable to satisfy their requirements.

She lives with her daughter and son. The latter has migrated to Russia as he couldn't find any employment opportunities in his homeland to be able to take care of the family. \r\n\r\nGayane currently runs a small local store where she sells different grocery products, some clothes, and glassware.

This kind of work will allow her to earn an income to support her family, since she lives in a common-law marriage and has 4 children.\r\n \r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Se\u00f1ora Santusa answered that she likes the training, the savings and the health service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":1441479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy drinks, rice and noodles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T20:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T20:00:01Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santusa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vidalia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Panfilo\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Quintina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1794.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1904.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1957.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2010.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2065.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2122.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2178.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2237.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2298.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2430.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":284.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":299.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":324.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":260.61,"local_amount":1794.36,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1800.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153745},{"amount":276.67,"local_amount":1904.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1911.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615318},{"amount":576.28,"local_amount":3967.84,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3981.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736258},{"amount":299.94,"local_amount":2065.12,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2072.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641768},{"amount":308.23,"local_amount":2122.24,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2129.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108704},{"amount":316.44,"local_amount":2178.8,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2186.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923771},{"amount":324.99,"local_amount":2237.6,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2245.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144634},{"amount":686.84,"local_amount":4729.08,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4745.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838411}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T15:16:56Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:35:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":610727,"name":"Hrantik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hrantik is an experienced farmer from the village Khndzoresk of Syuniq region.

His family consists of his elderly pensioner mother (in the photo), his wife and three school age children (elder son is in the photo). Sasun and his family breed a livestock of cows, pigs and hens. They are also engaged in beekeeping and cultivation of several fruits (peach, cherry, plum, quince, pomegranate, fig, blood orange and walnut). Livestock breeding and horticulture are the most important sources of income for the family. To sustain and continue his agribusiness Sasun needs a loan of USD 3000 to purchase four pigs, to buy forage for the livestock and to make credit repayments. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to the hard work, Sasun was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Sasun and his big family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to develop their

She lives with her husband and two little sons (8 and 2 years old). Manushak works in the local school. The salary she gets there is very low, and it is impossible to meet the family's daily needs with that salary. With the help of her husband Manushak breeds a livestock of cows and hens. The family is also engaged in cultivation of several fruits (peach, apricot, apple, pear and walnut). Those are the most important sources of family's income. As the family's everyday costs are increasing day by day, they need to find more sources of income to meet their needs. Manushak currently needs a loan of USD 3000 to purchase a cow and calf, to buy forage for the livestock and to pay for the harvesting services. She and her family will be very thankful to all the lenders for supporting them to maintain and develop their agribusiness.

She lives with her husband and elderly father. Peruz's husband is a contractual serviceman in the army. Peruz is engaged in breeding livestock: cows, pigs, piglets and hens. She is also cultivating grapes. Farming is a very important source of income for the family. To continue developing it, Peruz needs some financial assistance. She particularly needs a loan of $3,000 to purchase two calves, to buy forage for the livestock, and to pay for the harvesting services. As this is Peruz\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history.

una comunidad muy alejada del municipio, para llagar hasta donde se re\u00fane el grupo se necesita de transporte especial. Es un lugar muy bonito, se caracteriza por tener mucha vegetaci\u00f3n y una gran cantidad de \u00e1rboles. En la comunidad a\u00fan se habla la lengua mazahua. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron por dos razones \"Ilusi\u00f3n\" porque quieren progresar y sobresalir pero tambi\u00e9n por el nombre de un lugar muy especial para todos ellos \"Los Lobos\". La se\u00f1ora Avelina es la representante del grupo, ella es muy sonriente, siempre est\u00e1 de muy buen humor y su alegr\u00eda se contagia a la hora de platicar con ella. Tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Francisco desde hace ya 27 a\u00f1os y juntos formaron una familia con seis hijos de los cuales ya solo dos dependen de dicha pareja y a\u00fan asisten a la escuela. Do\u00f1a Ave, como le llaman, se dedica a la cr\u00eda, engorda y venta de cerdos desde hace ya 10 a\u00f1os; los compra con un proveedor de Michoac\u00e1n quien se los deja m\u00e1s baratos. Do\u00f1a Ave comenta \u201cInicie mi actividad de los cerdos porque una se\u00f1ora me vendi\u00f3 una cerdita solo ten\u00eda curiosidad, pero esa cerdita ya ven\u00eda cargada: tuvo nueve cerditos\". Ave cri\u00f3 y vendi\u00f3 los animalitos y obtuvo buenas ganancias, fue as\u00ed que decidi\u00f3 dedicarse de lleno a la actividad. Estos animales son comprados desde muy chicos con apenas cuarenta d\u00edas de nacidos durante cuatro o cinco meses los alimenta con ma\u00edz y cuando alcanzan un peso m\u00e1s de 100 kilos los ofrecen para venderlos. En esta ocasi\u00f3n, Ave est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para comprar material como cemento, varilla, cal, block para la construcci\u00f3n de sus saudas aunque por el momento no tiene ning\u00fan cerdo est\u00e1 pensando que los comprar\u00e1 en el mes de diciembre, pero quiere tener un lugar ya bien establecido. En el mes de agosto termin\u00f3 de vender sus 10 cerdos. Do\u00f1a Ave est\u00e1 muy contenta porque gracias a su esfuerzo han podido levantar sus casas de material m\u00e1s reforzado. \u201cAnteriormente mis hijos, esposo y yo viv\u00edamos solo en unas casas de madera pero desde que iniciamos con la cr\u00eda de estos animales hemos podido levantar nuestra casa de colado\u201d. Al parecer no presenta ning\u00fan reto importante en su actividad. Do\u00f1a Ade comenta \u201cMi sue\u00f1o es poder terminar nuestra casa en un segundo nivel para vivir c\u00f3modamente con toda mi familia incluso mis nietos, pero tambi\u00e9n me gustar\u00eda que mis ni\u00f1os terminaran de estudiar y si se puede, que estudien una carrera profesional.\u201d Las integrantes del grupo son Do\u00f1a Margarita y Rosa quienes invertir\u00e1n en la cr\u00eda, engorda y venta de sus borregos.","en":"The \"Ilusi\u00f3n los Lobos\" group is in a remote community away from the town. To get there, the group needs special transportation. It's a beautiful place, known for having a variety of vegetation and many trees. They speak the Mazahua language in the community. They chose the group's name because of the two meanings of \"Ilusi\u00f3n\" and because they want to progress and stand out, but also for a place that is special to all of them, \"Los Lobos.\"\r\n\r\nAvelina is a member of the group. She loves to smile and is always in a good mood. Her happiness is contagious when talking to her. She is 42, and has been married to Francisco for 27 years. They have six children, two of whom are dependents and in school. Ave, as she's known, works by growing, fattening, and selling pigs. She has done this for ten years. She buys the pigs from a vendor in Michoac\u00e1n, who sells them at a low price. Ave says, \"I started my work with pigs because a woman sold me a small pig because I was interested. However, that pig was heavy and had nine piglets.\" Ave raised and sold them and earned some income. This is when she decided to make a living from this work. She buys the animals at a young age, barely 40 days old. For four to five months, she feeds them corn and when they reach 100 kilos, she puts them up for sale.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ave is requesting a loan to buy supplies such as cement, spokes, lime powder, and blocks to build a larger space for her pigs. Right now, she doesn't have any pigs, but she's thinking she will buy them in December. First, though, she needs an established space. In August, she finished selling off ten pigs. Ave is very happy because thanks to her efforts, she has been able to improve her house with better materials. \"Before having children, my husband and I lived in a house made of wood, but since we started raising animals, we've been able to build this plaster house.\" There doesn't seem to be any particular challenge in her work. Ave says, \"My dream is to finish our house with a second level so we can live comfortably with everyone, including our grandchildren. But I'd also like my children to finish school if they can, that they study a professional career path.\" The other group members are Margarita and Rose, who will invest in raising, fattening, and selling their sheep."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1441446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies such as blocks, cement, lime powder, wire, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Los Lobos Centro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4273.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4574.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4783.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5036.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5330.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":368.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":329.44,"local_amount":4273.88,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4312.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644471},{"amount":352.66,"local_amount":4574.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4616.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877932},{"amount":368.72,"local_amount":4783.5,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4827,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766965},{"amount":388.26,"local_amount":5036.82,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5082.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247776},{"amount":410.92,"local_amount":5330.88,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5379.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072850}],"funded_date":"2013-10-01T20:33:52Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Polenske","image":1311923}},{"id":610511,"name":"Mo Shakti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seema is about 32 years old and lives with her husband and four children at JK Pur in Rayagada district of Odisha state in India.

Since the age of 11, he has worked with his father, who taught him all he knows. He works from Monday to Saturday. He walks 45 minutes to get to the place where his crops are. He had to work in subsistence agriculture due to his lack of education. The loan will be used to buy fertilizers and to pay workers to sow 7,000 square meters of beans, with which he will be able to get food for the other year and have grain to sell. With his work, he hopes to be able to improve his home, which is in a bad state. It is made of bahareque [interwoven sticks and mud] and in the rainy season it tends to get damages."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1441429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizers and pay laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"German Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215665}],"funded_date":"2013-09-29T06:26:26Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:13:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Jones","image":1058194}},{"id":610693,"name":"Neijay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neijay, a 39-year-old woman, lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well known markets in Montserrado county.

He is living with his parents and siblings. He is engaged in maintaining a general store. He is the only earning person in his family, and this business supports and manages his family's monthly expenditures. He sells items like rice, cooking oil, sugar, soap, hair oil, etc. in his general store.\r\n\r\nThere are 250 potential customers in his village, but he is unable to meet the customer demand. He needs to travel to the nearest market in the village with the help of his brother to refill his stock every day, depending on the demand, as he does not have funds to maintain inventory levels sufficient even for a week.

This area is becoming one of the more populated communities in Montserrado due to some options such as good roads, quietness, and the lower price of house rentals. \r\n\r\nEsther is married and her husband is a driver. They have a two-year-old child who lives at home. For over ten years now she has been selling used clothes in the local market. She sells from Monday to Saturday using ten hours each day. She stated that her main challenge is the rainy season, but she realizes some profit at that time. She started this business with money from her husband, and learned the business from her friends. She is requesting a loan to purchase more used clothes for her business. She plans to build a house and educate all her children in the near future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1436552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She has been able to pay school fees for her 7 school going children\/dependents and also construct houses for rent to add on to this income.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan of 4,000,000shs to buy materials for finishing up her house - majorly plastering, fixing doors and windows in her house. She is looking forward to the time when the house is complete and she will no longer be renting.\r\n\r\nTeopista's major challenge is the seasonality of her business where some times she fetches little profits which can not help in providing all the basic needs for her family and also put back into the business.

Each one has her own business: Raquel sells clothing, Maricela sells backpacks and shoes and finally Emma sells clothing. \r\n\r\nEmma says she is 40 years old and is married to Narciso. Together they make a family with 8 children although only one of them is still dependent on them, studying in Secondary School. \r\n\r\nEmma is requesting this loan from VisionFund and Kiva to buy more clothes, cloth, thread, yarn etc. She has done this business for 19 years. She comments,\" I started selling clothing myself as there where so many children. I had to do something to help with the household expenses and the education of my children\".  She started selling accessories in the small plazas and villages. She remembers that although she didn't have a fixed place to sell the revenues were good. However little by little she was able to save enough to rent a more stable commercial spot so she didn't have to trudge through the streets. This was when she decided to sell clothing of all sorts.\r\n\r\nShe has had this place for 3 years. It is located in another municipality. Emma's difficulty is that the rent is very expensive and she has not been able to find another at a better price. She pays 4000 MXN monthly. At first she paid half that, but the rent has increased little by little climbing to that amount. This does not discourage her, just the opposite. She is very hard-working and needs this income to continue paying this rent. It is much better to have the stable location than to carry her merchandise home with her at night, which for Emma would be a lot more work. \"I would not want to lose this place as it is difficult to get a place. My only goal is to continue to support my child with his studies. I would love to see him become a professional as he would be able to enjoy a better quality of living\". \r\n\r\nThe three members of the group are grateful with the institutions for the loan as they can invest in their businesses and be able to offer a higher quality of living to their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1441438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothes, cloth, thread, yarn etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Cruz Mextepec, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-29T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-29T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7656.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":8005.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":8459.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":8877.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":585.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":647.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":679.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":585.86,"local_amount":7656.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7669.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991825},{"amount":612.57,"local_amount":8005.88,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8019.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644473},{"amount":647.28,"local_amount":8459.48,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8473.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877934},{"amount":679.29,"local_amount":8877.87,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8892.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766967}],"funded_date":"2013-09-29T08:14:32Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T13:55:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":610640,"name":"Ann Maa Bilasuni Self Help Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Basanti is a 44-year-old lady.

Her business started through family tradition, since she learned it from her mother. Taking advantage of the fact that she lives near the Troncal del Occidente highway, where travelers and visitors to a well-known park come by, she started her own business and it went well.

The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

Her past loan enabled her to support her child to finish secondary school and move  on to pursue a university degree. However, the tuition fee is quite a burden for her family. To tackle this issue, she applied for an education loan to pay the tuition fee of her son, who is studying at a local school specializing in Finance and Banking. Moreover, with a small portion of her loan, she will buy school materials for her son. \r\n\r\nShe hopes this loan will support her son\u2019s education costs on time so that her child can pay more

They are all very good neighbors who know each other very well and live in a Mazuhua community, which is recognized for the majority of its people who work making embroidery. In addition, there are very leafy trees in the community. \r\n\r\nThe community members have deeply rooted customs and traditions. One main characteristic of the people in this community is that they still speak their Mazahua language, in addition to speaking Spanish. They majority of the group members work making embroidery, preserving the community\u2019s tradition \u2013 thus, the name of the group. \r\n\r\nAlejandra is a member of this group. She says that she is 52 years old. She married Marcos when she was 29 years old, and together they have a family of four children who are now independent. Alejandra has worked doing embroidery since she was forty. She says that she learned this work because, since she was very young, her mother also worked making these handicrafts. \r\n\r\nAlejandra concluded that, \u201cKnowing how to embroider is a tradition; here, anyone who doesn\u2019t make these kinds of embroidery - it\u2019s as if they didn\u2019t live in the community, because it\u2019s part of our customs.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlejandra has a small shop in her house where she sells her handicrafts. She has no problem making sales. This time, she is requesting the loan to purchase more material, like needles, yarn, wool cloth, etc. \r\n\r\n\u201cFor me, the loan will be a great help, because in this way I will be able to obtain my material more easily.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlejandra\u2019s main obstacle is the lack of a market in which to offer her goods; in her community and the surrounding areas, it\u2019s very difficult to get good earnings. \r\n\r\n\u201cI would like it if they would help us to look for a good market or some method of offering our embroidery.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe has been taking out loans from VisionFund and Kiva for several months, which has been a great help for her business because of the ease with which she can obtain her raw material. Alejandra\u2019s and the group\u2019s goal is to improve the quality of life for their families.
