She says that the main challenge in her business is transportation problems. \r\n\r\nMariatu requires a loan in order to buy more flour, sugar and cooking oil to prepare her bread. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her standard of living. In the future, Mariatu plans to change her business to a provision store. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1437060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Jorge grew up in the countryside with his parents who taught him the ropes in being a farmer and this helped him so that is the years to come he could carry out this role for the benefit of his family. He owns a very fertile plot of land of 3 hectares on which he grows organic cacao and other profitable products from his region with the help of his wife and children.\r\n\r\nJorge feels very much at ease with his work as he likes working in the fields in the open air without any pressures of the fear of earning a profit at the end of each harvest. He usually hires workers from the area who help him with complex tasks such as clearing weeds from amongst the plantations and cutting sick branches to improve the commercial quality of his products. As well producing cacao, he also owns several fruit trees such as banana trees, orange trees and mango trees which he sells on the weekends at the local market in his area in order to gain additional income.\r\n\r\nJorge describes himself as being very responsible and preparing everything for each production cycle with the purchase of organic fertilizer. This is his first loan with Kiva and he feels very grateful for the financial support that he is receiving to get ahead in life. At this moment in time, he is seeking 1,000 Peruvian Nuevos Soles to buy organic fertilizer to continue fertilizing his fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1441551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-29T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-29T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":110.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":121.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":124.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":133.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":140.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.68,"local_amount":105.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":109.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905697},{"amount":41.32,"local_amount":110.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":114.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091680},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":121.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":125.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778276},{"amount":46.99,"local_amount":125.31,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-27T09:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":130.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598685},{"amount":46.85,"local_amount":124.93,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":129.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147611},{"amount":53.77,"local_amount":143.38,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-04T09:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":148.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240703},{"amount":48.04,"local_amount":128.11,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-03T10:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":132.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258187},{"amount":52.85,"local_amount":140.94,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-03T11:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":146.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491502297}],"funded_date":"2013-09-30T18:00:43Z","paid_date":"2015-04-03T11:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":611112,"name":"Sokhoeun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokhoeun is 27 years old and the married mother of two children, one schoolchild and one little kid.

The members decided on this name because there was a pot with a striking, beautiful orchid at the house where they were meeting. The members of the group that are requesting loans are Celinda, who will invest in toys and novelties, Joaqu\u00edn who will invest in the breeding and sale of sheep, Carmen and Regina who will invest in the rearing and sale of chickens, and Agustina and Ana Karen  who will invest in their grocery stores.\r\n\r\nAlicia, or Ali, who is the representative of the group, is 57 years old, married to Gustavo, and together they form a family with three children. Ali has been breeding, fattening and selling pigs for several years. She explains that when she was little, she would watch her neighbors doing this activity, and she decided that she wanted to do the same in the future. With already 4 years of stable business, Ali says that it is not a difficult task raising her animals because they don't require much work. \r\n\r\nShe likes to have animals because in some way they are a source of income. Ali buys them when they are little, and then raises and fattens them over a period of approximately four to five months. During this time, Ali must feed the pigs very well with corn, and another type of food three or four times a day. When they are already a considerable weight is when she starts to offer the pigs. She offers her animals to her neighbors occasionally when she gets lucky, and to people that come to her home to buy them without needing to search for a buyer.\r\n\r\nOf the four years she has been conducting business, she has not had any considerable problem, but when her pigs become sick and die, these are losses of investments and earnings. For Ali, it's very normal that her little pigs always get sick. She goes to the vet to see if there is a cure, and this is how she saves her pigs. Nevertheless, despite this difficulty, she doesn't think to stop raising pigs because, even though she doesn't have children in school anymore, her dream is to be able to improve her home with her earnings.

There he began to grow organic cocoa trees and pineapples, among other things.  One of the main problems that he faced when starting out was a reduction in the price of dried corn due to people buying up quantities to keep them off the market. This put his earnings at risk, as he had made a considerable investment with respect to his first crop, and he was at risk of failure.However, with great dedication and effort he succeeded in making progress.

She learned this activity from her mother, who has done this for many years. In this way, she has been able to generate enough resources to get her family ahead. Now she is asking for the loan to buy raw materials wholesale (corn and firewood) in order to take advantage of the discounts she gets by buying in large quantities. This way, she will have materials for production to fill the orders she has in a timely manner. This will open up the possibility of increasing her clientele and therefore her income.

Suele fertilizar sus terrenos de cultivo con abono org\u00e1nico ya que el caf\u00e9 es un producto muy representativo en su regi\u00f3n por la calidad que suele obtener gracias a los factores  clim\u00e1ticos. Tiene la suerte de contar con diversos compradores a lo largo y ancho de su zona que remuneran el trabajo de los agricultores como ella de manera justa. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva y se siente agradecida por el apoyo que recibe para seguir adelante, adem\u00e1s se compromete a pagar sus cuotas de manera puntual. En esta oportunidad desea contar con 1,000 nuevos soles para la compra de abono org\u00e1nico.\n","en":"Yesenia is 25 years old and single.  She has no children but she is the owner of her adobe house, which she was given by her parents.  Yesenia grew up in the country and learned to work as a farmer.  She now has a plot of land where she grows coffee and cacao.  These crops are her main source of income and she is dedicated in her work as these are products that allow her to earn a good income.\r\n\r\nWhen Yesenia started this work, she did not think it was easy but she wasa able to follow family tradition and earn an income from the job that she likes most.  Yesenia usually fertilises her land with organic manure as coffee from this region is known for its high quality that results from the climate.  Yesenia is lucky to be able to count on various buyers from across the region who pay coffee growers a fair price.  This is Yesenia's first Kiva loan and she is grateful for the support she is receiving in order to get ahead.  She promises to make her payments on time.  On this occasion Yesenia is applying for a loan of 1000 Nuevo Soles in order to buy organic manure."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1441632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic manure for her crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-29T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-29T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":110.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":121.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":124.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":133.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":140.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.68,"local_amount":105.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":109.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905703},{"amount":41.32,"local_amount":110.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":114.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091686},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":121.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":125.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778282},{"amount":46.99,"local_amount":125.31,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-27T09:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":130.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598691},{"amount":46.85,"local_amount":124.93,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":129.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147617},{"amount":154.66,"local_amount":412.43,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-04T09:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":427.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240709}],"funded_date":"2013-09-30T04:07:10Z","paid_date":"2014-10-04T09:50:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":613885,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nancy, a sus 32 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su esposo e hija de a\u00f1os.

(Christ is the hope). She is a young mother with three children. She lives with them and her long-term partner in a simple structure, located in a rural community in the city of La Romana. Specifically, the community is a batey (company town) founded for sugarcane workers. \r\n\r\nMargarita says that her most important challenge is to have her own house and to raise her children with a safe home and support all their needs. She operates a fruits and vegetables stall, a place where she sells goods to make daily income for food. This is a small stall in front of her house selling the most favored vegetables like plantains, cassava, potatoes, and veggies for salad.

Now he wants to buy more raw materials for selling in order to expand his business.\r\n \r\nThis is why Khursheed came to BRAC Pakistan as she wishes to obtain a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, to buy inventory for her husband\u2019s shop, such as timbers and planks. \r\n\r\nHer husband hopes that this loan will prove beneficial and productive for his business as well as his family.\r\nShe says thanks to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan, for this honorable support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1437654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy timber and planks for resale.

He was born and raised in the country and worked many years on a farm, responsible for a wide range of agricultural tasks. \r\n\r\nConcerns about safety prompted Camilo to move to the city with his family. He then began to work in a cafeteria, and soon took the initiative to start his own business. Camilo runs a cafe in a very busy neighborhood, on a street leading to a beach. He works seven days a week from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and has one employee. \r\n\r\nCamilo's drive, determination, and dedication have helped him achieve his goals. He's survived tough times and still faces various obstacles, such as truck driver strikes, that directly affect his sales. But Camilo doesn't let such challenges hold him back, and keeps looking for opportunities to improve his business. He is therefore applying for a loan so he can invest in chairs, tables, and wholesale inventory  (snacks, sodas, coffee, fried foods, and other goods). \r\n\r\nThese investments will allow Camilo to offer his customers a greater variety of goods to satisfy their tastes, increasing his sales and thus his income.

Together with her husband she works in agriculture, particularly in the planting and cultivation of coffee. It was her parents who taught this activity to her at a young age because in her family it is a means of income, covering different needs such as: clothing, food, medicines with many restrictions, among others. The land that she - together with her husband - cultivates is her own, as she inherited part of it from her parents so that she would be able to work and could have an income.

Anyi works on the weekends at a tavern where she sells fast food, but she also divides her time between this job and selling merchandise on her own so that she can supplement her income.  She is an active, enterprising, and vibrant young woman who strives tirelessly to provide the best for her young son since he is the main reason why she continues to work each day.    \r\n\r\nAnyi is requesting a line of credit so that she can invest in the purchase of merchandise in bulk (shirts, jeans, shoes, belts, and other items).  This will enable her to take advantage of discounts for purchasing with cash.  As a result, she will be able to increase her profit margin with each sale.  In addition, Anyi will have a wider variety of available merchandise to offer to her customers, which will satisfy their diverse tastes.  Anyi wants to continue working in this manner so that she can fulfill her dream of opening a clothing store where she can offer brand-name merchandise.  She wants to become well-known so that she can have financial stability, which will allow her to provide a good education for her son and have a positive contribution to the household finances.

Approximately 8 years ago she set up her own business, a corn cake factory which began as a result of the economic crisis suffered by her family after the death of her husband. Gradually it has gone from strength to strength, yet she never studied and everything that she knows today is a result of trial and error. She worked Monday to Sunday from 5 am to 4 pm, so that she could take advantage of the time to meet the orders of all her clients. She is requesting this loan as help in order to expand her business. She plans to adapt and expand the storeroom, expand the ovens, purchase an electric mill and purchase raw material (corn) and supplies for packaging. As a result of these, she will be able to improve working conditions and will be able to meet order deliveries in a timely manner, which will give her the opportunity to expand her market and increase her sales and income. Mariela dreams of growing her business and turning it into a large manufacturer and distributor of corn cakes which generates higher returns, giving her the possibility of supporting her children

He is married and the father of 3 children. He was born in the country, where he learned the tasks of farming and livestock raising, thanks to the teachings of his father and siblings. He worked for many years in a business, but at the time of his retirement he decided to to begin the activity of cattle raising. To that he acquired dairy cattle and breeding cattle to add to the family's income. While he has done his work he has overcome different adversities due to the high cost of concentrate and fertilizer for the pasture and the low prices of milk. Nonetheless, he has gotten ahead. Right now, he is asking for the loan in order to invest in buying more breeding cattle and to pay off a previous loan that he has.

This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins.  They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese government.  Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney.  The modifications made it open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  Now, jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and to repay microfinance

At the age of 55, after being a homemaker for the majority of her life, she makes a living selling merchandise via catalogue.  In the beginning she did it as a pastime, to change her household routine.  Now she has very good customers and works with six catalogues, which lets her offer  wider variety to her buyers, who live in different neighborhoods near her home.  In addition, she has some products on sale in her home.  \r\n\r\nEmilse's known to be an organized, active, and enterprising woman.

She works alone every day and during the the busy season hires someone to help her out. Her business has provided her the resources to support her family: her husband and her 12-year-old son. She is requesting this loan to carry out some needed renovations, including replacing the floor and painting the walls of her business as the health authorities have required.

That\u2019s where he learned agricultural work, thanks to his parents\u2019 teaching. Now he sells young cattle. He raises them and feeds them and then sells them. This is how he generates sufficient income to take care of his household and provide for his family\u2019s basic needs. His family is his wife and their three children. He is thriving and a hard worker, characteristics that are well-known among people who live in the countryside. With painstaking care and dedication he has achieved his goals. He is requesting a loan because he wants to buy more young cattle. This way he could increase his production and have the possibility of improving the income margin he receives from the sale of his cattle. It would also help him to expand is herd and get full use out of the land he owns, which is where he works. Luis hopes that the difficulties faced by the milk industry will improve because his dream is to complement his work with the production of milk. This would open the possibility of increasing his working capital and improving his loved ones' quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1442365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

However, he doesn't presently have enough capital to purchase everything he needs to carry out the home improvements. For this reason, he decided to request a loan of YER 300,000 to purchase doors and windows to complete building his house. He hopes with this loan the family can live in a more comfortable place.

He moved to Kupang city in West Timor, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province to further his career. \n\nHe worked with an NGO for over a decade, then decided on a career change.  He started a small business that sells a variety of products from flight tickets to phone and electricity credit. To assist his village back in Alor, he set up a savings and loan group to serve the unbanked community with basic financial services. \n\nAfter learning about Kopernik\u2019s simple and life-changing technologies such as solar lights, water filters, and clean cookstoves, his entrepreneurial spirit was sparked again and he sees the promising opportunity of joining Kopernik\u2019s Tech Kiosk network. He not only sells the technologies but introduces solutions to his customers\u2019 problems: difficult access to clean water, unaffordable LPG gas which make them to choose between three stone fire or kerosene stove, and frequent power cuts. \n\nWith a high demand for simple, eco-friendly technologies, Kalep is going to use the loan to buy more stock of green technology products and reach more people. Kalep is positive, responsible and offers good quality customer service. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1439962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase more stocks for his technology kiosk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":304,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T08:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T08:10:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalep","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":18940000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1578333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1578333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":1578333.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1597390.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419893999},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":1578333.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T18:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1597390.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429543280},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":1578333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1597390.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439764043},{"amount":1275,"local_amount":14205000.01,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14376512.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449666434}],"funded_date":"2013-10-02T22:35:36Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T11:56:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":611377,"name":"Kihani Turise Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kihani Turise Group is mainly comprised of women and a few men.

They range in age from 18 to 26 years old.  The group members are not employed and have been relying on seasonal casual labour as a source of income.  They came together to start this group so that they could make more money from their farming activities.  They are undertaking horticulture as their income-generating project, which is located on one of the member\u2019s homesteads.  From the proceeds of their project, they will raise income for their families. \n\nThey intend to use this loan to purchase a drip kit, seedlings and fertilizers as well to construct a mushroom growing house.  From the proceeds of the first crop under drip irrigation, they intend to purchase mushroom spores and increase the area of their cropping under drip irrigation.  The group plans to increase the area under drip irrigation from 250 to 750 square meters, by purchasing more drip kits over the next two cropping cycles (six to eight months from now).  With the introduction of mushroom production into their business, they aim to supply the local market as well as food outlets.  They also would like to use the proceeds from their business to build their own houses so that when they start their own families they are staying on the same homesteads with their parents or relatives. \n\nSimelukuthula (the group leader) is a young woman aged 26 and has twin children, a girl and a boy, aged two.  She currently stays on her own as her husband migrated to South Africa in search for employment.  However, since he migrated a year ago, he has struggled to find permanent employment and has therefore been unable to send any money to support the children he left behind.  Simelukuthula has thus been engaged in trading a variety of trinkets from which she raises money to take care of her children.  With proceeds from this loan, it is her hope that her income will increase and she will save to purchase household assets and build her own house. \n\nPENYA assists borrowers with entrepreneurial skills training through the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Program.  PENYA also helps them form Village Savings and Loans Associations where they save proceeds from their businesses that will then become the future sources of additional loans and business investments.  Finally, PENYA carries out mentoring and monitoring visits to ensure that the businesses are being run viably.

This way, he can stock up on what people ask him for that he doesn't have and widen the variety of products to satisfy the needs of his buyers. This way, the profit margin will notable increase and he will be able to sell more products. Julio dreams of having the possibility of giving his children a college education.

","en":"Mar\u00eda, 54 years old, runs her own grocery store, a store that she opened about 30 years ago and through which she has been able to generate the income to provide for her 4 children. Mar\u00eda says that she enjoys being independent, and the fact that her business is located at her house, also allowed her to take care of her home. \r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, due to increase of violence in her neighborhood, Mar\u00eda was forced to close her business, as she feared for her safety and that of her family. At that point, she began to work as a \u201cCommunity Mother\u201d with the ICBF (the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare), and ever since the situation improved in her neighborhood and she re-opened her business, Mar\u00eda has been carrying out both activities.\r\n\r\nNow, in an effort to further improve her business, Mar\u00eda is requesting a loan to buy a refrigerator and wholesale supplies (snacks, soft drinks, bulk grains, biscuits, dairy products, among others). In this way she will be able to increase her stored merchandise -especially dairy and meat products- and have a larger variety of supplies available to meet her customers\u2019 needs, which would be positive for the family finances. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda wishes to continue to work to make her business grow, and generate higher returns by increasing the stock of her products, so that her customers may find everything they need. This will help her to achieve economic stability and a pleasant quality of life that she may enjoy with with her loved ones.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1442373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator and wholesale supplies (snacks, soft drinks, bulk grains, biscuits, dairy products, among others).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74772},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76840},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78965},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81150},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83394},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85701},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88072},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90508},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93011},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95584},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98228},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100945},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103737},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106607},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109556},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112586},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115700},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118901},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122190},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125569},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129043},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132612},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136280},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140049}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Cespedes","image":1446372}},{"id":611446,"name":"Shahbana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahbana, age 38, is a married woman.

He has two buffalos and uses them to cultivate his 0.6 hectares of land. On his land Tamaz grows walnut trees and kidney beans. The harvested products are sold. His family consists of his wife, two children and brother-in-law.

They have lived in the same village for several decades and sustain relationships of solidarity and helping each other. They have small shops.\r\n\r\nMadam Asmao, 35 years old (sitting on the extreme right with her left hand raised), is the featured borrower of the group. She is married and mother to six children of whom one is a boy and five are girls. Her business is based on the sale of doughnuts made from mil [African cereal] flour in the weekly markets and in the village.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan, she plans on buying two bags of mil to transform it into mil flour, 10 kilograms of sugar, and other ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe profits allow her partly to help her husband to take care of the needs of the family and partly to grow her turnover.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5150,"image":{"id":1441860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

any country. Here is a story of a woman by the name of Ms. Samina, who was deprived basic necessities in her childhood. She found many problems during her own career building, and found non-conducive environment.\n\nSamina wants to serve her community through quality education. She explained her dream of community-oriented school for the deprived children. She says: \u201cI feel pain for the children who are not going to school because of financial barriers.\u201d  She opened her school in 2008 with the help of her husband.  \n\nInitially, she was teaching in another building that did not satisfy her eagerness of quality education. In 2008, the school had only two desks, one black board, one box of chalks, one teacher, and 10 students enrolled. She said that she started investing the entire income of her house on the school and waiting for best results. \n\nSamina says: \"It was hard time and we were facing many problems. Later on, income increased day by day because of our hardship and continued efforts.\" \n\nIn 2010, she went for a new building to expand her school. In the new building, she enrolled 32 students, and later on the enrollment increased to 95 students. She said during this, the building owner died and his son insists us to pay rent too high. At this point, she shifted her school into her house because of landlord misbehavior. She says that she was very disturbed and her school went down day by day.\n\nShe heard about Kashf Foundation through their family friends, and met Kashf staff for school loan purpose. Kashf team briefed her about Kashf School Sarmaya and its procedures. She shared her mission and vision with the Kashf team members. She discussed that if she gets the loan, she can provide many other good opportunities to her learners. She shared that she will construct her school rooms and provide furniture to the students. \n\nShe was so pleased to receive a loan of PKR 100,000. She said, children from low income background will get quality education and become responsible citizens.

This is 42 year old Susan from Mutare. She is widowed and has two children, one attending school.  Susan runs a retail business selling clothes and electrical gadgets. The business has been in operation for four years. She says the main challenges faced are high import duty at border posts and high transport costs.

She is 31 years old, married and a mother of two beautiful children.  Farida loves her children very much and tries to provide them with a good upbringing.  Her husband is in the Russian Federation.  He left there for work.  Farida is a kind and hardworking woman.  According to her friends' opinion, she is very outgoing and welcoming.  Farida loves animals and loves to feed them.  She transformed her favorite occupation into a profitable business.  Today Farida has several heads of small livestock and wants to get involved into a more serious business, for example, buying and selling cattle.  Of course, her relatives will help her with this because it would not be easy for her to fatten up livestock and resell it by herself.  She came to Arvand to make her plans come to fruition.  Farida plans to use this loan to buy livestock and increase her livestock headcount.  Because Arvand support women-entrepreneurs, Farida hopes that the organization will help her with financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1439136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":494.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":505.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144335}],"funded_date":"2013-10-03T21:54:33Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":611585,"name":"Mariliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariliza is 31 years old and married with two children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by pig fattening in the Philippines.

However, thanks to his hard work, Karlen was able to run his business in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Karlen will be thankful to all the lenders for helping him to sustain his small business"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1437895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Veterinary Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase vet medication to resell in pharmacies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Nor Kesaria village, Armavir region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karlen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":114.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":112.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":118.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":122.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":127.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":130.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":130.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":137.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":144.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emina Tudakovic","image":825486}},{"id":611494,"name":"Kanyanku Ugafode Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kanyanku Ugafode group is located on the outskirts of Rukungiri Town.

Davlat is not yet married and lives together with his parents and a brother.  After graduating from school, Davlat could not go to a university to obtain a higher education due to the family's financial problems.  This is why he has to be involved in a small business to earn a living.  His parents do not work because of their health, and the oldest brother helps Davlat to run the business.  They have been involved in selling accessories for women's clothing for three years.  Davlat brings the merchandise from the capital and sells it at a local market.  He already has regular customers since women love these types of things.  Davlat has a good, regular income from this business.

In search of income for her family, Asel started a small business in sewing women's clothing in 2008 after her divorce with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  The business is very good, but more importantly Asel enjoys her sewing work that yields her a monthly income of 8,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Asel requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy fabrics for sewing women's pants for the fall season.  Asel wants to use the earnings from this loan to expand her business and also to save money to buy two additional sewing
