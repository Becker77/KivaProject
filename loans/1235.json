Despite the difficulties in the area of maintaining revenue-generating businesses, these members are very courageous and fairly robust in their determination. The members are in solidarity with one another and live in the same village. The main work is small-scale commerce, along with farming during the rainy season. \r\n\r\nMs. Mariama (seated at the right with her left hand raised) is the featured borrower of the group. She is 47 years old, married, and the mother of three children (a girl and two boys). Her business involves processing peanuts into peanut butter, which she resells at the weekly international market in the sub-region. To do so, she purchases peanuts by the sack or basin, according to what is available on the market. She sorts them and cooks them, and then finally processes them by machine to obtain peanut butter for sale by 15- or 20-liter pails.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to purchase three 50-kg sacks of peanuts at 12,500 francs CFA to process and resell. \r\n\r\nThe profits will be used to help her husband to manage the family day to day, and some of it will go into her savings account. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1430395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase peanuts to process and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T18:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T18:00:12Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonkarou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tacko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Penda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tacko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boulayel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halimatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Diadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koumanthio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diabouyel Issa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diabou Boudy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dienabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danfang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sountoukoung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3500,"local_amount":1700000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1700729.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467887457}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T07:37:41Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:30:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":611659,"name":"Remedios","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remedios is 56 years old and married.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

As a child development major at San Diego State University, she was an integral component in the development of a \u201ckindergarten readiness curriculum\u201d that was subsequently implemented in Head Start programs around the country.  \u201cChildcare is my passion, I love getting down and playing with the kids and doing activities. It\u2019s satisfying to watch them learn new things,\u201d she shared.\r\n\r\nAfter her son Henry (pictured) was born, Louise sought a way to continue her passion of working with children while remaining a stay at home mom. It seemed only natural to start Green Beans and Little Sprouts, a healthy living preschool with an emphasis on hands-on education. Green Beans and Little Sprouts emphasizes the \u201cReggio Amelia\u201d method of teaching, entailing that students have some control over the direction of their learning in a supportive and enriching environment.  Louise plans to employ three teachers, dividing her space into an \u201cinfant room\u201d, \u201ctoddler room\u201d and \u201cpreschool room\u201d. \r\n \r\nChildren enrolled are taught the importance of a healthy diet and eat exclusively organic food arriving regularly from local farms. She shared, \u201cHealthy food is very important to us; our kids will often request milk or water as opposed to sodas when out of the classroom. That makes me feel great.\u201d Music and language are also an important component of the curriculum that Louise has created. Students are engaged in Spanish songs weekly as the importance of being bilingual from an early age is highlighted.\r\n\r\nKiva is an ideal financing solution for Louise as traditional loans were not an option for her. She shared, \u201cBanks were telling me that I needed to have been in business for two years before being considered for a loan, how was I supposed to do that?\u201d After securing rent payments for the first two months as well as an initial deposit from family members, Louise looked to the community for help. \r\n\r\nLouise will use her $10,000 Kiva loan to furnish her preschool, purchase necessary educational equipment and cover initial payroll for each of the instructors. In addition, these funds will ensure that only the highest quality organic local foods are provided for her students.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her business will continue to take root and that her work will create a positive impact in the lives of her students. Although Louise currently has a license for six students, she will be moving in October to a new location that will accommodate over twenty. When asked about her future dreams, she joked, \u201cMaybe I have to start an elementary school next!\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1438136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

The women have all lived in the same village for several years and maintain relations based on solidarity and mutual aid. They have, as their main business, the sale and growth of peanuts during the rainy season. Ms. Awa (standing to the far right with her hand raised) is the star borrower of the group. She is married, 33 years old, and the mother of 5 children, of which 3 are girls and 2 boys.

They are starting their second nine-month cycle with Namaste.  In the first cycle they were very responsible with their payments and worked hard with their Business Advisor.  In this cycle, they want to continue learning how to manage their businesses.  One of the women said, \u201cWe learned in the first cycle how to control our expenses and how to manage our profit.  Now we want to learn more about how to make our businesses bigger.\u201d\n\nAng\u00e9lica Maria (1st from left) is 33 and has a third grade education.  She is in a domestic partnership and has five children, ages 11, 10, 8, 6 and a baby of 5 months.  The three oldest are in school.  The family lives in a one-room wood house constructed by her husband.  There is an outdoor kitchen and latrine.  There is no potable water so they get their water from a river about 150 yards away.  Her business is selling little chicks that she buys at one day old for about 60 US cents and sells after 2-3 weeks for about $1.20.  She spends her days selling chickens and looking after the children.  Her husband keeps an eye on the chicks at night (to avoid robbery) and works in whatever he can find during the day.  She supplies most of the income for the family, with her husband providing money when he finds work. \n\nAng\u00e9lica Maria plans to use the money from her loan to fix up the area where she keeps the chickens, including putting wire mesh all around to prevent them from being stolen, and also to buy more chickens.  She currently sells approximately 12,000 chickens a month.  She spends 120 hours on this business and the rest of her time taking care of the children and home.  Her current profit is about US$623, and she plans to eventually add 3,000 more chickens and increase her profit by 25%.  She wants to have enough money to send her fourth child to school when he is ready next year.  Her goal is to keep growing her business so that she can meet all the chicken needs of her area. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1442755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to fix up the area where she feeds her chicks and to buy more chicks for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Pajales, San Andres Villa Seca, Retalhuleu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-09-30T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-30T21:10:13Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magnolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":8800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":977.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":977.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.55,"local_amount":974.26,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":988.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419860874},{"amount":113.28,"local_amount":886.07,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":898.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509411},{"amount":124.58,"local_amount":974.48,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":988.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733263},{"amount":125.13,"local_amount":978.78,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":992.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449639184},{"amount":136.53,"local_amount":1067.96,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1083.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459105538},{"amount":125.93,"local_amount":985.13,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":999.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467920414},{"amount":125,"local_amount":977.78,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":991.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479141184},{"amount":125,"local_amount":977.78,"processed_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":991.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490835101},{"amount":125,"local_amount":977.76,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-26T09:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":991.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543546}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T17:04:25Z","paid_date":"2014-08-26T09:16:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":613914,"name":"Ram\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ram\u00f3n  es un hombre  soltero de 26 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a sus padres y hermanos en el Departamento de Solol\u00e1.\nEl es un hombre trabajador que tiene el deseo de superarse y darle lo mejor a su familia.

Ansatou (pictured standing on the right with her left hand raised) is the featured borrower of the group. She is 19 years old, married and the mother of 2 sons. Despite her young age she is a very dynamic woman and has two loan cycles to her credit so far. She is a reseller of spices and various other food products like green tea, sugar, refined oil, biscuits, and children's candy in the village. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ansatou plans to increase her stock of green tea by two packages, her stock of sugar by a half-bag, and her stock of candies and biscuits by containers for resale.

Thirty-three years old, she is married and mother to 6 children (5 boys and 1 girl).\r\n\r\nShe buys and sells foodstuffs such as rice, oil, sugar..., a business which she has been in for 3 years.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she plans to get her supplies from the wholesalers at the regional central market to resell retail in her village and at the surrounding weekly markets.\r\n\r\nShe resells a 22,000 F CFA bag of sugar for 30,000 F CFA.

He would like to combine crop production with animal husbandry, and wants to buy some livestok to create his own barnyard.  However, he does not have enough savings to realize his project and this is the reason why he is taking a loan.  \r\n\r\nHis plan is to buy three head of cattle every month (cows and calves) and resell them for a profit at the cattle market 30 days later, after having fattened them.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs, and for her child\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nAngeli dreams of expanding her business, and hopes that her children will have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She started in this business 25 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Rozakan's hard work, her farming business now comprises two dairy cows, two calves and 15 head of sheep.  She makes a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her animal husbandry business, Rozakan has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).

In the beginning, they crushed the material by hand, but little by little, the business became more profitable, and she acquired a hydraulic press. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to invest the loan that she is requesting in paying for manual labor to separate out the different recycled materials, so that they can later be crushed, thereby avoiding an overflow in the storeroom where they keep the garbage. This will allow her to speed up the sorting process, so that she can later sell everything that she has collected and make available the money that has up to now been sitting in the storeroom as recycling material. \r\n\r\nAracely dreams of continuing with her work, so that in the future, she will be able to obtain a vehicle that she can use to transport the recycling on her own. In this way, she can increase her profitability through commercialization, opening the possibility of offering a better quality of life to her children.

Bakhrom and his wife are happily married and try to raise their children to be good people.  He and his wife are happily raising their grandchildren as well, as his oldest son and daughter  already have their own families and children.  \r\n\r\nFor the past several years, Bakhrom has operated his own bakery, baking loaves of tasty Tajikistani flatbread and selling them to the locals, as well as to tourists from other countries who buy them as souvenirs.  His bakery provides a stable source of income for his family, and also allows him to set aside money for his grandchildren.  At the moment, Bakhrom is seeking to expand his business, and needs to stock up on baking supplies to do so.  To this end, he hopes to receive a loan from Arvand to buy the supplies he needs.  He is hoping for a positive outcome, and thanks Arvand in advance for their help in expanding his business.

Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Studying at school, we gain knowledge and skills for future development. But there is a day when we finish school and stand at a crossroads, where every road is a path on which we will go into the future. It is known that everyone has their own aptitudes and wishes. Based on these, we choose our path. \r\n\r\nIn the future, I want to be a specialist who can speak the language of business and administration. I am sure that education, training, and the ability to work, which I received at the Lyceum, can go on by learning the program of Business Administration at the American University of Central Asia.\r\n \r\nThe choice of this career, first of all, associates with a rapidly developing system and market relations in the daily life of our country and the world.\r\nWhereas before, during the Soviet system, everything was decided by the state authorities in the form of state plans and five-year plans. Nowadays we are living in times of market economy and all ways are open for business. If you have the necessary knowledge, you can open your own business and develop it, or realize yourself in a variety of business firms, cooperation and government organizations.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, I chose a path \u2013 studying the laws of business and administration. For this, first of all, I consider it is necessary to get a quality education, and I\u2019m sure at AUCA I can get it because in our country, only there that appropriate education is given. After learning that the business administration program at AUCA is the leading business program in our region, I definitely stopped my choice on it. In addition, the fact that many of AUCA graduates continue their education at the universities of the United States, Europe, and other major countries also affected me.\r\n\r\nThe school where I studied, I was tough to work, having explained to me a simple postulate, which states that the work is the result of my own efforts and leads to quality education. In 10th grade, I began to participate in the Olympiad on mathematics. But then I was advised by my teacher to take history. I won it twice and then I took second place in Republican Olympiad.\r\n \r\nIn the future, I would like to become a professional who is able to manage large business projects where new, innovative, and creative ideas and programs will be generated and implemented. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my parents cannot afford paying the tuition fees fully. But AUCA gives a very good opportunity to its students. All the students of AUCA have an opportunity to get Kiva loans to cover the tuition fees. So, I am applying for a Kiva loan, which will help cover the fees.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1429310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Since seventh grade, I have excellent marks in all subjects and over the past five years my GPA at school was 5.0 and I am a holder of Diploma with Honors. In ninth and tenth grades I was a president of my class and made big changes in our extracurricular activities, one of which was gathering smart students together. The group was responsible for students with marks. We used to help those who had difficulties in their studies in order to advance their knowledge through organizing English language, math, chemistry, biology and computer courses. I was the one responsible for math and chemistry courses. As a consequence, our class became one of the best among four.\r\n \r\nTo take part in the development of my country is one of my dreams and I must take my place in the society to make it happen. I hope our generation will bring big changes to our country\u2019s development. \r\n\r\nMy family cannot afford to pay the tuition fee fully as we have five children in our famly, and my parents pay not only for my education, but also for my siblings.

Social activities really bring me pleasure. There were so many competitions that I took part of in my life. One of them was the Turkish Olympiad, which I aimed myself to win. I tried it every year from 7th to 10th grade and I won. The finalists were sent to Turkey, so I visited Turkey. Lots of school children were representing other countries too and I was so proud to represent my country.\r\n\r\nIt was an exciting trip, and I won bronze medal for my presentation. I wished I've won 1st though. But I am sure, I will be able to do so in the future. While in Turkey, I deeply felt how much I love my country, and I represented all the best things we have: our national dress, our hospitality, etc. \r\n\r\nMoreover, my presentation was about \u201cManas\u201d, which I think was a great thing to share with others. All people wanted to take a picture with me and I was so excited about that. I also took an active part in many other extracurricular activities in my school. \r\n\r\nI believe that both my educational background and all the mentioned above will allow me to be one of the best students of AUCA. I will try to be one of top students.\u201d

The last year was a very important period in my life, because I finished a preparatory program, and I had to decide which profession I would choose for my future. \r\n\r\nThe idea to enroll in the American University of Central Asia has been in my mind for a long time. I wanted to study at AUCA since I was twelve, because I heard that it is a unique institution and that I can get a high quality education there. \r\n\r\nAUCA is the only university in Central Asia with such a great method of education. Now I am happy to study at AUCA, in the department of Sociology. From an early age I have been interested in humanities, as well as different societies and cultures. Therefore, I chose Sociology as my future and want to obtain a Master's Degree in Europe or the United States, similar to many AUCA graduates. I would like to do an internship or find a job. However, after spending 3-4 years abroad, I would like to come back to Kyrgyzstan and work here.\r\n\r\nI had a big desire to study at AUCA, but my family cannot afford to fully pay the tuition fees. So I would like to take an opportunity of applying for a Kiva loan, which is given to each student at AUCA.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1431360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Raisa studied at a private school, \u201cIlim.\u201d  Below is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy parents believe that the future of each person depends on the quality of the education. Therefore they did their best to give all opportunities to get a high quality secondary education. I studied at one of the best schools of Bishkek. I also have a brother, who enrolled at University in Moscow after graduation of secondary school. \r\n\r\n\"Besides I strongly believe that each person has a duty to involve in social life. I am an active person and try to take part in all social events actively. I have a volunteering experience: there is a relief fund for orphans and older people in our secondary school. We organized volunteer groups and visited an orphanage, named 'Meerim bulagy.'  Our group picked up clothes, toys and bought food and presented them, but the most important thing that we came to share our love and care with them. We organized concert, sang songs, danced and played. In the end, children didn\u2019t want to let us go. Besides, I visited a home for the elderly and sometimes brought them to school, where we organized a holiday for them. I also work in Resource Centre for the old people in Kyrgyzstan since February. \r\n\r\n\"I hope both my educational background and my volunteering experience will help me to be one of the best students of AUCA. The American University of Central Asia has been the University of my dreams for years, and I will try to do all my best to be one of the best students. \r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, my parents cannot afford paying the tuition fees fully. Therefore I am applying for Kiva loan, which will give me an opportunity to cover my higher education.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1430161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

There are many universities in our country, so the step of choosing a suitable one defines our future career and even the whole life. it is known that one of outstanding universities in Central Asia is AUCA because it provides high quality of education and a big variety of extracurricular activities. There are lots of required and well-paid professions nowadays and AUCA gives an opportunity for students to choose and study according to their interests. \r\n\r\n\"A reason of my desire to study at AUCA is that I am fond of mathematics, economics and even international relations with other countries. Economics is one of the most important sciences, which helps to develop the world\u2019s living conditions and relations among the people from different countries. I think it is amazing to forecast the future decrease or increase of economics situation, estimate all important object and sources and make correct decisions which will determine my future success. That\u2019s very outstanding and useful knowledge which I can get at AUCA. \r\n\r\n\"I have some achievements in education. I won second place in the English language in Republican Olympiad. At the same time I have a particular interest in mathematics and physics. Last year I won second places in regional Olympiads in math and physics. \r\n\r\n\"Our family is not able to cover the tuition fees fully, though. Therefore I would like to apply for Kiva loan, which is great opportunity. I hope to get this financial support, so that I could fully dedicate myself to studies.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1430286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for his higher education.

I have graduated the Aga Khan Lycee in Khorog, Tajikistan. It was my dream to study at AUCA, department of International and Comparative Politics, and I am really happy that I\u2019ve been admitted to this program. I am interested in this field because my society faces many problems related to politics that need specialists who are able to bring changes to the system of policies that lead to the development of my society. My interest in the subject grew when we studied economics, history, law and humanities in my ninth to eleventh grades and through my involvement in the sessions conducted in American Corner, a project of the US Embassy. \r\n\r\nThe last few years of school, I was involved in a number of extracurricular activities. One of those was organizing charity competitions between youth in my local area last year. The aim of the competitions was to help sick or poor people with the money received from the competitions. People of different ages participate in competitions of various kinds of sports like volleyball, basketball, football, tennis, etc. The collected money was directed to help people in need; for medical treatment. These competitions became a positive push for school children, and now there are already several groups taking part in these competitions as well. Apart from sports, I also play guitar and sing. I think this experience will allow me to take an active part in the extracurricular activities of the university to make it interesting.\r\n\r\nI live in a family of five: my parents, two siblings and myself. Education is very important for my family. Therefore, one of my important aims is to increase the financial situation in my family through education. My siblings also study at the Aga Khan Lycee, which has a monthly tuition fee, so it is unaffordable for my parents to pay for all of us. The tuition fees will increase much more than it before, when three of us studied in the Lycee. I hope to get financial support to pursue my further education at the American University of Central Asia \u2013 the University of dreams.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1431924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his higher education.

So I dreamed of getting a higher education at a prestigious University like AUCA. I know, in order to study at University, I need to work hard to show high performance, but rarely thought of the financial aspects of education.

My two brothers also study at the Aga Khan Lycee, which means that my parents pay their tuition fees also.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration my family\u2019s income and expenses, I will need finance assistance to continue my education in the future. Although my family income is not so much, my parents always try to support me, but I know it will not be affordable to cover the tuition fees at the American University of Central Asia. Continuing my education at AUCA will prove to my family that their hard work and sacrifices were not in vain. I would also challenge my younger brothers to continue their education and also follow me as a role model in the

I have worked diligently to maintain excellent grades and had the highest GPS among other students in my class throughout 11 years of study, which is given on my transcript in details. For my achievements I received a 50% discount on the tuition fees, which I am very grateful of. I am very well prepared for the specialization I chose and my special efforts were dedicated to my further studies at the American University of Central Asia. I tried my best to achieve best results not only on advancing my literacy in English language, but other skill as well. I am sure my effort will be considered and help me in pursuing my studies at AUCA. I very much hope that I will be one of candidates to get some financial aid for my studies, which will make my dream come true. The American University of Central Asia has been the university of my dreams for years and I do not want financial restrictions to be a barrier for my future success.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1431909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He received a loan to grow his business and has showed himself as a responsible client who pays his dues on time. Daler used to be in the collective farming business and received good income. But because of the drought and other weather related conditions he lost half of the harvest every year. This made a big damage to their family's budget. Later he has decided to start doing animal husbandry and received additional income from it which helped him cover all family expenses. At this time Daler started another type of business and bought a truck to buy and sell coal. He buys coal from another region and sells to the local residents. Right now is the beginning of the winter season and people start to stock up on coal for heating. Daler has come to Arvand and wants to get a loan to buy coal. He hopes for a positive outcome and is thanking Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1437759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase coal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T07:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daler","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":114.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":128.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":134.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":140.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":144.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":147.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":150.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":154.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":157.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":158.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":613841,"name":"Angeles Del Cielo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cANGELES DEL CIELO\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el noveno ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Santiago II, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Hilda es la Presidenta.

When it snows, it\u2019s worse, because it becomes so very cold inside that you see animals start trembling from it.

They also help in the fields with various activities such as spreading fertilizer and manure, leaf applications, weeding etc. to keep them well maintained. Three grandchildren also live with Miriam.\r\n\r\nShe has seven years of education and attended a nearby school. She has been a housewife and farmer for more than thirty years as it was through her husband that she learned about farming. Agriculture is the only means of earning a living in the area where she lives.\r\n\r\nAs well Mirian has a small grocery store in her house and a mill for grinding maize. The land where she farms is her own; after many years of effort they were able to buy it. It is located thirty minutes from the house, and on it she grows a variety of coffee plants. She and her husband thank God for this great privilege and opportunity in spite of the challenges that this type of farming brings on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nMirian\u2019s plans for the future include continuing to expand the farm by buying more land. This will enable her to leave her children a good inheritance so they can continue working the land for generations, a great blessing.\r\n\r\nToday Mirian is seeking a loan to buy farming supplies such as manure,  plant fertilizer, special feed for coffee plants, fungicide, herbicide etc. to provide protection for the plants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1441886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy farming supplies for her coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T14:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T14:10:15Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.93,"local_amount":1678.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833772},{"amount":83.27,"local_amount":1665.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1702.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042237},{"amount":83.85,"local_amount":1677,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710578},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1704.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449616541},{"amount":83.85,"local_amount":1677,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082653},{"amount":83.93,"local_amount":1678.67,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895442},{"amount":82.68,"local_amount":1653.66,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1690.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118204},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1704.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490813030},{"amount":331.79,"local_amount":6635.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6783.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504237158}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T19:04:51Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:06:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":611918,"name":"Nasira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasira is a 31-year-old married woman.

She is feisty, enterprising and has a strong desire to overcome obstacles and get ahead.  Isis has a partner and is a mother to four children.  The children support Isis with her work in the country, helping with cleaning, cutting, and laying manure and fertiliser on the coffee crops.  Isis only completed up to fourth grade but could not continue in education as her parents had little money and could not help her.  Since her childhood, Isis has made a living growing coffee, work which her family did before her.  This work is Isis' only source of income.  Her parents taught her to work the land many years ago.  Isis inherited their land from her parents some time ago, and it helps support the household and cover costs such as food, clothing, school costs, medicines and the like.  The land is 20 minutes away from where the family lives, and can be arrived at on foot.\r\n\r\nIsis is currently applying for a loan to buy fertiliser and manure to maintain her coffee crops.  With this she will have a healthy and good harvest to generate an income, earn a profit, and will be able to continue investing in her work.\r\n\r\nIsis' goal are to be able to grow more plants so as to earn a higher income for family.  She could then invest more and expand her harvests.  Isis' profits will be used to give her children a future and to further invest in her land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1441924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming supplies for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isis Marilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1.5,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":30.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082569},{"amount":1.75,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":35.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895339},{"amount":1.17,"local_amount":23.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":23.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118089},{"amount":0.58,"local_amount":11.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812935},{"amount":995,"local_amount":19900,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":20342.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562417615}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T17:05:28Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:25:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":611920,"name":"Nazia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazia is a 29-year-old married woman and a mother of three.

The mother of six children, she lives with her spouse and their children in a polygamous family in Hamdallaye, one of the neighborhoods surrounding Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Ms. Mariatou has run a traditional soap-making business for about nine years. The traditional soap is used primarily by women for laundry. The soap she makes is sold from her home and at the market, where she is very sought after by her clientele for the quality of her products. To meet the increasingly growing needs of her clientele, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. She is on her second individual loan, which she expects to use to purchase two barrels of potassium and 50 kilograms of shea butter. She buys her primary materials to produce the soap there in Sikasso. Her clientele is primarily made up of men and women. Her previous loans were properly repaid. She imagines that with this loan she will make a monthly profit of 80,000 f CFA , which will be used to increase her business funds, contribute to her family's expenses and pay the interest on the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1443232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase soap-making ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972496},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625060},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851072},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740721},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T09:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220298},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-21T09:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045212},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.26,"processed_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263079}],"funded_date":"2013-10-01T19:56:13Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T20:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Martha Schmitz","image":489893}},{"id":611923,"name":"Rasheeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasheeda, age 56, deals in the business of animal sales.

name of Mutabar was born. From early childhood Mutabar loved nature and animals. She would grow plants in her bedroom and helped her parents breed animals. She grew up  to be a kind, well-behaved girl. Like all village women Mutabar is very hard working. She is a caring mother and an understanding wife. Mutabar's husband Suyunboi works on the field and grows various crops. But Suyunboi's work is seasonal. Outside of harvest they rear animals. In doing this job they follow in the footsteps of their parents. In the village, the fattening, purchasing and selling of livestock is a profitable and attractive business. In order to develop her business Mutabar contacted MDO Arvand to ask for a loan, for at the moment she does not have enough money. With the proposed loan, Mutabar plans to buy livestock and hopes that MDO Arvand will support Mutabar in the implementation of her own business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1439077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The mother of two children, she lives with her spouse and their children in a nuclear family in Hamdallaye, one of the districts surrounding the city of Sikasso (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). In this way, she currently runs a business buying and selling tubers (potatoes, yams and spuds) and various small goods at the market, where she is very sought after by her clientele for the quality of her products. To satisfy the increasingly growing needs of her clientele, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. She is on her thirteenth individual loan, which she expects to use to buy 70 bags of tubers.

He is 53 years old, married, and has one son. His son is also married and has his own family; they all live in one big house. Khasan is a taxi driver. The community where they live is small, and Khasan has built a reputation as a good taxi driver among the residents by always treating his customers with integrity. Khasan's son works at the local market, selling various household items. \r\n\r\nThe house where Khasan's family lives is in poor condition, and is long overdue for repairs.

This will allow Juan to continue advancing toward his main dream, which is to one day have 1,000 avocado trees.

","en":"Kulurukan is 55 years old and a widow. After her husband's death, she has been raising three children and running her own farm. Kulurukan has a secondary education. The family's primary income comes from animal husbandry. Kulurukan started her farm 29 years ago when she purchased cattle with 2,000 KGS. Because of Kulurukan's hard work, her farm now has two foals and 0.96 hectares of a land share, which she uses to grow potatoes and clover every year. She earns a monthly income of 7,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Kulurukan has asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy a bull for cattle breeding. Kulurukan plans to invest money she makes from the loan to increase the number of domestic animals she owns and to save enough money to repair her
