It has already been 10 years since Vahan started providing telephone services. Particularly he provides telephone connections abroad and gives locals an opportunity to talk with their relatives abroad.  As the emigration rate of Armenia is very high and almost every household here has a relative abroad, Vahan's service is in high demand. Due to his hard work over these 10 years, Vahan was able to form a client base that only uses his provided service. Now, this hardworking young man needs financial support to be able to make network improvements and pay for a new connection which has higher quality and speed. \r\nVahan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

Their businesses include, making tortillas, selling fruits and vegetables, selling other food, and selling used clothing.  They work hard, either at home or in the nearby city of Mazatenango, to support their families and keep their children in school.  It is for their children that they want their businesses to grow and prosper.  They all dream of their children getting an education and having a better life. It is because of this dream that they have eagerly entered the Namaste program that will provide them a business advisor and money management classes in addition to a loan.  \nMaria Isabel (1st from left) is 43, married, and has a child going to school.  She has a 2nd grade education.  Her business is selling tortillas close to a famous chicken restaurant, a good location.  She gets up very early in the morning to make tortillas.  There is no roof over her cooking area and she has to work in the rain during the rainy season.  She hires a woman to help her so that she has enough tortillas to sell.  With her loan she will buy corn and wood in bulk to get a better price.  She will also buy 6 pieces of tin with which to make a roof and enclosure for her cooking area.  This is especially important now, as it is the wettest part of the rainy season.\nMaria Isabel sells approximately 32,500 handmade tortillas a month, working 234 hours.  Her current profit is approximately USD 465. She plans to sell 6000 more tortillas per month when she has more corn and wood.  She then expects to have a profit of USD 538.  With this 16% increase in profit she will be able to keep her business growing and ensure that her child gets an education.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1443627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn and wood in bulk, and tin to cover the work space where she makes tortillas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Gabriel, Suchitepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-10-02T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-01T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pahola Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karla Majenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":12200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1355.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1355.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1355.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1355.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1355.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1355.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1355.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1355.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1355.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":172.22,"local_amount":1355.61,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419860875},{"amount":172.06,"local_amount":1354.25,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1365.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509412},{"amount":172.23,"local_amount":1355.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733264},{"amount":148.9,"local_amount":1171.98,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1181.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449639185},{"amount":157.18,"local_amount":1237.16,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1247.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459105539},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":891.99,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":899.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467920415},{"amount":60.7,"local_amount":477.79,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":481.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479141185},{"amount":381.16,"local_amount":3000.12,"processed_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3024.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490835102},{"amount":172.22,"local_amount":1355.52,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-26T09:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543547}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T03:11:31Z","paid_date":"2014-08-26T09:16:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":612067,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juana is a merchant from San Miguel, Bohol.

When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Reah replied, \"Their living standard will be raised.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Reah owns a cow, but does not own a pig, poultry, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

She has three children and has been doing this work for five years. Her primary income sources are from selling milk, eggs, tea and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Profits!' Her biggest challenge is 'Poor weather.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Nyangera.'\r\n\r\nEvelyne was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'it has affordable rates.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Gives loans.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

The living conditions there are a bit difficult due to the high rate of crime, fewer bathrooms, filthy conditions, over populated, but most interesting part is that rooms are a bit cheaper, there are transport options, some of the biggest markets in Liberia, and cheaper food.    \r\nAbigaie is married, and her husband works as a steel bender. They have two children aged 8 and 13 who are currently attending school and living at home. Abigaie did not attend school; before starting her business she was involved with sales of cosmetics in the local market. With the loan proceeds she will buy more cosmetics to sell. She said \"beside fewer goods on my table market, I have no other problems for now\". With a little money from her mother she managed to establish this business, and learned by seeing other businesswomen five years ago. She enjoys the flow of customers. Her dream is to move from table to shop

She has been selling braised fish for two years in a neighborhood of the capital. Thanks to her savoir-faire in this field and to the fact that her prices are reasonable, she has been able to build up a large and loyal customer base, which continues to grow.

They are both in school. She was only able to go to school until sixth grade due to her family's economic difficulties. Her husband is a livestock trader. He buys them and then sells the animals at a better price. Her two children depend on her. For about three years, she has worked with her husband buying and selling livestock. Her father was a rancher and she learned how to care for the animals from him. Before, Veronica sold tamales, pupusas, and other street foods with her mother, but she realized that selling livestock bears more fruit. The loan will be used to purchase livestock to sell later and this way, earn a good profit if the price of the animals does not go down. Like all responsible parents, Veronica's dream is for her children to finish their studies at university, and also for her to earn good profits from her business and expand her sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1444306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

As a mother, her dreams are to be able to give her young children a good strong future through the legacy that she is establishing with her husband and that her children can live their lives in a positive way.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1442783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies and to pay laborers to cultivate a new coffee plantation.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-02T16:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-01T16:50:08Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":851.42,"local_amount":17327.17,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":17394.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082656},{"amount":573.58,"local_amount":11672.83,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":11718.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118092}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T22:10:38Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:41:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Hildreth","image":null}},{"id":612275,"name":"Tahira's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tahira is a 38-year-old lady living with her spouse and seven children in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.\r\n\r\nShe is a responsible mother; her two children are too young and fully dependent upon their parents.

Kitwe is the second largest city in Zambia and is the mining center of the Copperbelt province.  \n\nSandra received her first Kiva loan in early 2012 and her second in May of 2013.  The loans helped grow her business by opening additional outlets and having adequate working capital float to service customers efficiently. She also enrolled herself at one of the largest universities in Zambia, where she is studying business finance.  \n\nNow that Sandra has successfully paid back both her loans, she is requesting a third loan to open a new shop in Luanshya, a mining town located 51km away from Kitwe. The loan will be used to purchase a trading booth and use the rest as working capital float for the new shop. Sandra explains how having sufficient working capital is important to a successful new shop opening so you do not have to turn away customers. Having the shop start well is needed to maintain a good reputation within the community and grow.\n\nSandra wanted to let Kiva lenders know that she is grateful for their support. Now, she is able to take better care of her family and grow her business.

I have a younger sibling who lives with me and grandmother. My grandmother has been the one who is taking care of us and funding our study. I hope I can do something for her.

accounting. The reason is I am interested in studying about company financials. Because I am in the first year of school, formerly I found a little bit of difficulty to make the adaptation with new friends and a new environment. But, so far, so good. Truly, my real problem is paying the school fee. My parents are only poor farmers. They do not have enough money to fulfill my school expenses.\n\nTo all generous Kiva lenders, I would like to ask you to help me so that I can reach my life dreams and have a better life than at present. My hometown is Jeruklegi Kulon, Cilacap Regency, Central Java Province. It is geographically hilly, tranquil and far away from a big city. The population is rare. \n\nMy mother is a farmer, and my father is a farmer too. My mother\u2019s salary per month is only Rp (Rupiah) 400,000. The amount of children in the family is two. Their ages are 15 and 19 years old (including me). I am the only one who is still studying at school. If I am given the Kiva loan from lenders, I will spend it to pay my school fees.\n\nAt school, most of my time table is accounting lessons because my majority is accounting. Besides that, I also learn other lessons, such as English, civil, math, Indonesian language and so on. I chose this study program because someday I want to be a financial administrator at a company. The fun thing at school is I have and meet new things and new friends.\nIn the picture, Rusmini and her daughter,

Learning it, I am able to know about how to build and manage a company on my own and also how to be a good entrepreneur. My problem is financial. My family is poor and cannot pay the school fee. Before knowing about Kiva, I had no hope to continue my study, but after knowing it, I have new hope to continue my study. It\u2019s like the light of a candle in the dark. I am sure, only with the education that can change my life, I will have a better future.\n\nWe have a house with a broken and leaking roof, and when the rain comes, there are many rain water drops in the house. My hometown is Jeruklegi Wetan village, Jeruklegi Subdistric, Cilacap Regency, Central Java Province. Geographically hilly and rocky, the road is bad and far away from a big city. \n\nMy mother is a walker food seller. Their salary per month is only Rp (Rupiah) 600,000. The job of my father is a brick layer. He works only when someone needs him to build or renovate something, such as a house, walls, etc. But if no one employs him, he is jobless.The amount of children in family is four. Their ages are 23, 22, 15 (me), and 6 years old. The children who still study at school are I and my younger sister, Salsa. If I am given the Kiva loan from lenders, I will spend it to pay my school fees.\n\nAt school, most of my time table is accounting lessons because my majority is accounting. Besides that, I also learn other lessons, such as English, civil, math, Indonesian language and so on. I chose this study program because someday I want to be a financial administrator at a company. The fun thing at school is I have and meet new things and new friends.\n\nIn the picture, Sayem and her daughter,

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMargarita dreams to have a bigger store and hopes for good health for her whole family.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance

She cultivates potatoes, alfalfa, grass and walnuts. Svetlana's agribusiness currently needs some investment to function in a sustainable way. She needs a loan of USD 3000 to buy three calves, some forage for the livestock and to make credit repayments. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Svetlana has been able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. Therefore, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Svetlana will be thankful to all the lenders for helping her to maintain her agribusiness.

Their lands are located 1.5km from their home, and they travel there by foot or by donkey.   \r\n\r\nHer future plan is to increase her planting so that she has a variety to offer her customers and everyone else who consumes her coffee.  In this way, she will be able to earn a higher income; this will strengthen the inheritance for her children and grandchildren, and ensure that they continue working the land generation to generation.  \r\n\r\nToday, she is requesting a loan to buy farming supplies in order to perform the necessary maintenance on her crops, so that she can have a good coffee harvest and prepare her lands for the following harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1444309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming supplies in order to maintain her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-02T19:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-01T19:40:14Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10215,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118093}],"funded_date":"2013-10-03T02:12:22Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T10:41:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":613281,"name":"Ana Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La cliente es de la ciudad de Quevedo.

So, every day, Rosa goes out with her partner and they work very hard so that their children will have better opportunities in the future.  Rosa is a farmer and makes a living growing coffee, which she sells to neighbours, warehouses and intermediaries, at harvest-time.  Rosa is a mother to two children - they are still too young to go to school.  Rosa owns the land she works - her parents left her some of the land and she was able to buy the rest thanks to her efforts and sacrifice.  The plot of land is some two kilometres from her house, and she arrives there by foot.\r\n\r\nRosa has applied to \"Comixmul\" for a loan in order to buy five bags of manure, three litres of boron, and 50 loads of coffee for her crops.  With this she plans to expand her crops and strengthen the inheritance she will leave for her children.  Rosa's future plans are to improve her system at work - i.e. she wants to buy a machine so that she can work more accurately and quickly.  She would also like to produce a different variety of coffee - one that is better and more competitive in the market.

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Funds farmers.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Samwel replied, 'Upgrade their livelihood.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Samwel owns the following: cow and poultry. But he does not own: pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net and TV, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, or DVD.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1439118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-10-02T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-01T21:10:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2.18,"local_amount":187,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":190.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419881084},{"amount":25.22,"local_amount":2161.94,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2206.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529717},{"amount":25.89,"local_amount":2219.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753570},{"amount":21.35,"local_amount":1829.58,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1867.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343465},{"amount":57.66,"local_amount":4942.24,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:34:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5044.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467944021},{"amount":61.54,"local_amount":5275.22,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5384.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479165018},{"amount":82.05,"local_amount":7033.14,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":7179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570511},{"amount":22.09,"local_amount":1893.66,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1932.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530053867},{"amount":33.17,"local_amount":2842.88,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2901.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547096},{"amount":12.52,"local_amount":1073.14,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:58:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625431},{"amount":6.33,"local_amount":542.11,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":553.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824875}],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T00:50:50Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":612323,"name":"Asmat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asmat, age 31, is a married woman and a mother of two.

She has some post-secondary education, and raises livestock for a living, having started 5 years ago with 5,000 somoni worth of livestock.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, Adilet's farm currently has one dairy cow, one heifer, one calf, and 10 sheep, and  her monthly income is 10,000 somoni.  To further develop her farm, Adilet is seeking a loan of 110,000 somoni from Bai Tushum and Partners; specifically, she would like to buy more cows for her farm.  She plans on using her increased income due to the loan to buy even more livestock for her farm, as well as to set aside money for her children's

Her children now live independently. Tursunbu has a secondary education. The family's primary source of income is animal husbandry.  Tursunbu started this business twelve years ago when she bought cattle for 15,000 KGS. Due to Tursunbu's hard work, her farm now has three dairy cows and fourteen sheep. She earns a monthly income of 12,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Tursunbu approached the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy cattle for breeding. Tursunbu plans to use her profits to increase her livestock and plans to save enough money to buy a

She is seeking a loan of 100,000 somoni from Bai Tushum and Partners to further develop her farm; specifically, she wants to buy more cows, and hopes to use any extra income due to the loan to buy even more livestock for her farm, as well as to save money for her son's wedding reception."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1443929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cows for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Beshim village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-02T21:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-01T21:50:06Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulsara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6499},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7411},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7597},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7787},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7981},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8181},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8385},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8595},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8810},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9030},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9256},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10468}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":615369,"name":"Leonel Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonel es un joven de 18 a\u00f1os de edad, estudiante de primer a\u00f1o de la carrera de Ing. en computaci\u00f3n, en la actualidad no trabaja, sus padres le apoyan con los gastos universitarios.

They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nAnna owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one (14-16 person capacity) jeepney unit, which are paying boundary (daily quota)* each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1.000 every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. \n\nAnna dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\n\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\n\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\n\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1385045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for spare parts and maintenance of her jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-10-02T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-01T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3452.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824885},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2301.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478707},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2133.62,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2301.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701109},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533.38,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T09:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":575.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450029394}],"funded_date":"2013-10-03T00:45:12Z","paid_date":"2014-02-19T09:50:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beth Rattigan","image":null}},{"id":612342,"name":"Khurelpurev","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khurelpurev, 24 years old, lives with his mother, wife, and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

She is a 28-year-old married mother of three children, one of whom is in school while the other two are still too young to attend. \r\n<p>\r\nRice farming has been the main source of her family\u2019s income for the past five years. She and her husband earn about 33,000 KHR a day to meet their family\u2019s needs. They also manage to save about the same amount daily for future needs.\r\n<p>\r\nSavdy is the leader of this two-member group.

She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nAminata requires a loan in order to purchase a gallon of palm oil to resell.

After the death of her husband she raised three children on her own as well as taking care of her farm. Almakan has a specialist high school education and raises crops and livestock as the primary source of income for her family, something she began 23 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 3,000 KGS. Thanks to Almakan's hard work, her farm now includes five sheep as well as 1.6 hectares of land under cultivation, on which she grows peppers, beans, clover, corn and beets every year, with a monthly income of 9,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her farm, Almakan has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 25,000 KGS to buy a cow to increase her number of livestock. She plans to invest income from the loan toward a further increase in head count of household cattle, and to save for her children's education.

","en":"Nurali is a native of the J. Rumi region. He is 52 and a family man. At the moment Nurali wants to raise sheep. Sheep breeding is one of the universal and most promising branches of animal husbandry. In Tajikistan the development of this branch of industry has for the most part been in the south of the country. Sheep mature quite quickly and in addition are undemanding in terms of living conditions.\r\n\r\nNurali is a newcomer to this occupation, but feels that it's never too late to begin.

She is married with three children, ages eight month and 13 years old.  She began her business because she wants to empower herself. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Isatu established her local food stuff business. She works at the business from 8:00 am until 9:00 pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to purchase gallons of palm oil, coconut oil and pepper. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her children school fees and increase her business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Isatu plans to own the biggest local food store in the community. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1439342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is single with no child for now.  She began her business because she wants to develop herself and her parents. In 2011, Hassanatu established her palm oil business.  She works at the business from 8:00am until 9:00pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nHassanatu requires a loan in order to purchase gallons of palm oil for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and enable her to attend a vocation school to learn hairdressing. In the future, Hassanatu plans to become a hairdresser. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1439272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

years old, she is a widow. She has raised four children herself after her husband's passing and also runs her business. Ashyrbubu has secondary education and does animal husbandry as a main source of income for her family which she started eighteen years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Ashyrbubu now has two milk cows, two heifers and two calves. Her monthly income is 8,000 som. With the goal to further grow her business Ashyrbubu has come to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 60,000 KGS to buy calves to increase the headcount of livestock. She plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of headcount of livestock and plans to save money to repair the house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1443950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives here with her husband and three children - ages 10, 6, and 3. Judith is 34 years old, has a diploma, and owns her own shop business. She believes she is hardworking, trustworthy, and very active in her community. Judith is involved in the women's group in her community.    \n\nThe community of Likindu village collects their drinking water from a river because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Likindu\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Likindu, 10 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water.  Judith has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Joseph, Shem, Gladys, and Beria.\n\nLikindu village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Judith believes that the dispenser will kill germs and prevent waterborne diseases that her family has suffered from in the past.
