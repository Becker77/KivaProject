She works at the business from 8:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m., Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and lack of finance to expand her business.\r\n\r\nMemunatu requires a loan in order to purchase different types of clothing material to expand her clothing business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and buy a piece of land. In the future, Memunatu plans to own the biggest clothing shop in the community.

For the past 10 years, Irshad has been running a business of carpet manufacturing. She makes it with the special kind of wood known as \"dub wood.\" Theses carpets are used in mosques for the purpose of prayer. \r\n\r\nBy this time, she has become popular in her community for providing good quality carpets. Her husband is a driver by profession, but his salary is not enough to meet home expenses, which are increasing day by day.

She has been involved in her own business for over 12 years.  She is involved in buying and selling fruits.  She buys fruits wholesale from other districts and sells them retail at a local market.  She has her own retail outlet and tries to offer the highest quality fruits to the local residents.  She handles the business by herself.  She faces many difficulties in running the business and dreams that her children grew up and started helping her.

Ryskan has a higher education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 23 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 80,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ryskan's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 horse and 50 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Ryskan requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a horse in order to increase livestock headcount. Ryskan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's continued

This is 35-year-old Alice from Kandeh town, in Bo, the southern area of Freetown. She is married with five children between the ages of six and 18. Her children are attending school, and she began her business because she wanted to be self-sufficient.\r\n\r\nAlice runs a cookery business selling cooked rice, fried fish and cool drinks. She has been running this business for 15 years. She wakes up at 4:30am to prepare her cookery business, and she does not rest until the food is finished. One of her daughters usually helps her to run the cookery. \r\n\r\nAlice's business is her only source of income. Alice says that her major hardship is that preparing the cookery can sometimes be very difficult.\r\n\r\nAlice has requested a loan in order to purchase cooking items, including bagged rice, coconut oil, and pure water. The extra income from this loan will allow her to change the structure of her cookery and pay her children's school fees. In the future, she plans to have her own residence. \r\n\r\nShe thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1439445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict

She owns a little grocery store which generates $US 182 monthly, and also works as an agricultural technician.  \n\nEnise has been an EarthSpark\/clean energy retailer for eight months.  She has always paid her balance on time, and as her client-base grows more and more people ask her for more products from EarthSpark\u2019s Eneji Pwop brand. \n\nShe would like to buy more products so she can serve more people.  She is very excited about the Eneji Pwop products, and says she sells the products because she wants to help people who are living in the country and have no electricity access.\n\nEnise wants to borrow 51,175 HTG so she can buy more products from Eneji Pwop.

Francisca is originally from one of the towns in Chinandega, in the west of the country, and near to one of Nicaragua's largest volcanoes.  Francisca has a small business - she runs a bakery out of her home.  She works Monday to Friday, producing delicious pastries, such as doughnuts, pastries filled with meat, cheese, or pineapple, rolls, snacks, \"three milks\" cake, corn-flour drinks, and more.  Francisca started her business a few years ago and it has helped her to have a higher income for the household.  Francisca buys her supplies from lorries that come by selling products, and she sells her goods in private and public schools, as well as to caf\u00e9s, and other regular and one-off customers.  She sells both on credit and in cash.  One of Francisca's dreams is to earn more money so as to improve her business.  She is applying for a loan in order to buy basic supplies such as flour, sugar, butter, pineapples, meat, cheese, honey, paper and other more.  Francisca is very grateful to Kiva lenders, who are supporting people with little money - and poor countries such as Nicaragua - so that they can have a decent job.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1444376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a widow who has been raising three children after her husband's death. She also runs her own farm. Bububatima has a vocational education, and the family's primary source of income is animal husbandry. Bububatima started this business 22 years ago when she bought livestock with 20,000 KGS. Due to Bububatima's hard work, the farm now has three dairy cows, two heifers, and ten sheep. She earns a monthly income of 7,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Bububatima asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy cattle for breeding.  Bububatima plans to invest profits from the loan back into the livestock on her

Once she has her PhD, Marly hopes to impact positively on public affairs by working on research into economics applied to real situations, bringing about changes and proposals on matters of policy which drive development and improve the quality of life of her city and the country. \r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nAlthough I have my family's support in achieving this dream, my parents cannot manage to cover such high costs as these due to their limited economic situation. Although I am currently working and saving, the money is not enough to cover the academic costs. For this reason it is necessary for me to ask for Kiva's help, as this can help me to reach my academic, professional and personal goals which are based on my plans to study for a PhD abroad.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 reasons for wanting to study for my PhD abroad; firstly because in my area of interest, which is economic policy and development, there are excellent schools and teachers located mainly in Europe and the US. In this sense, to be able to study under the conceptual and methodological guidance of the people who are at the cutting edge of their field is an excellent opportunity for any student in the world. My second reason is more personal and relates to my interest in intercultural exchange and meeting people from other countries who may have similar interests. \r\n\r\nI have worked in economic and social research and impact evaluation and this has motivated me to follow an educational path which includes a PhD which will strengthen and enrich the practical knowledge I already have. Moreover, it would give me pride and satisfaction to be able to contribute to the development of my city and my country, to be able to impact positively, via strategies and\/or programmes under a public-private alliance, on improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable people and the economic development of my city. For the above reasons I am interested in doing a PhD in economics as a way of fulfilling my study goals and to strengthen my employment skills. \r\n\r\nThe only guarantee I have is that I will put in the maximum effort and give the best of myself.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1445084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to cover the application costs to study for a PhD in economics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Manizales","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2013-10-03T18:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-02T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":217.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2730000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.35,"local_amount":227500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-11T10:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":228155.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.48,"payment_id":579541358},{"amount":103.45,"local_amount":227500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-11T10:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":228155.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.39,"payment_id":595140355},{"amount":105.25,"local_amount":227500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-11T10:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":228155.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.58,"payment_id":610534944},{"amount":94.06,"local_amount":227500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":228155.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.77,"payment_id":624206377},{"amount":98.22,"local_amount":227500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":228155.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.62,"payment_id":636192538},{"amount":727.16,"local_amount":1592500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1597087.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":118.67,"payment_id":650529938}],"funded_date":"2013-10-05T13:32:19Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":615768,"name":"Lazos Unidos Y Rumbos Distintos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cLAZOS UNIDOS Y RUMBOS DISTINTOS\u201d  se encuentra conformada por 05 socios quienes se encuentran contentos por estar pasando el 05 ciclo.

She is married and has 4 children.  Her children are going to school.  \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Tutu established her palm oil business. She began her business because she needs to generate income to take care of herself and her family. She works at the business every day from morning to night.  She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation.\r\n\r\nTutu requires a loan in order to purchase palm oil, gari and general stock. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and repay her loan. In the future, Tutu plans to see her business to her higher levels. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1439457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married and has 9 children ages 2 years to 25 years.  She began her business because she wants to create income to support her children and herself. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fatmata established her local foodstuff business.  She works at the business from 8:00 am until 9:00 pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase palm oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her children's school fees and increase her business. In the future, Fatmata plans to own the biggest local food store in the community. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1439460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives in the Caldwell area in Montserrado County. This area is becoming one of the more populated communities in Montserrado due to some options such as good roads, quietness, and the lower price of house rental. \r\n\r\nHelena is 33 years old. She is married and has 2 children, ages 7 and 13, who live at home and attend school. Her husband is a builder. She has been running a table where she sells cosmetics. She is asking for a loan to buy enough cosmetics to increase her sales. She complains that the price of cosmetics is the major problem she faces now.  \r\n\r\nShe started this business with a little money from her husband. She enjoys her business because she makes her own money, and she is so proud of her business because it makes her independent. Her plans are to one day own a house, and to see her children attending university in the future. She appreciates the supporters of BRAC Liberia.

She is a 38-year-old married business lady with four children. She runs a food business in the market and the business has been in operation for the last four years. She also sells lesos (African clothing also called kangas) in the same market.

He sells new and used clothing and with what he earns he is able to pay his daily living expenses, but he doesn't have enough money to fix up his home.  This is why he is asking FUSAI for a loan.  It will allow him to buy metal poles and sheets of galvanized metal so that he can replace the metal sheets he has now which are full of holes and in bad condition because of the smoke from the kitchen. With part of the loan he will also ask for a connection to the electrical power. He hopes he can count on the help he is asking for so he can take care of these necessities.

At first, she sold her harvest to middlemen who transported it to the city of Jun\u00edn. Eulalia says that the buyers saw that her maca was very good quality, and three years ago she received an offer to sell her harvest to a processing company in the capital that makes maca-based beverages.

Along with selling accessories, he also wants to provide mobile repair services. However, he does not have the savings to buy electronic components such as speakers, microphones, diodes, cathodes, LCD screens, etc., or mobile accessories.

He is married to his business partner, Jovita, and they have children. Together with his wife, he manages their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nVenancio operates a business buying and selling merchandise. What he basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, and then he sells it at a small profit. His products are footwear, sandals and other similar items. Customers are attracted to his business due to the low selling prices and the many options he offers. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 3000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nHe also sells fish and different vegetables for additional income.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, he is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. He will be utilizing the loan to buy a larger quantity and variety of sandals and slippers to expand his inventory of products.\r\n\r\nVenancio dreams that his business will continue to grow and hopes that his children will finish their studies.

Sabira has a high school education and raises livestock as the primary source of income for her family, something she started eight years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 KGS.

She and her husband are raising six children.  She has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business five years ago with the purchase of livestock for 6,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to Bekin's hard work, her farming business now comprises three dairy cows, three mares and 20 head of sheep.

Her life has been difficult: since her husband's death, she has faced much hardship in trying to provide for her children, Nargiza and Umeda. Maksuda started a business in animal husbandry, as she lives in a rural area. She possesses experience in raising livestock because she helped her parents in this activity; she was the only one in the family who fed the animals. \r\n\r\nFor the past few years, Maksuda has wanted to make renovations to her home, but does not have the financial means to do so.

He wants to take a loan to buy a new batch of turkeys and chickens, in order to increase the number of birds that he keeps at home.

He has a grown-up son, who lives in the city of Tarma to study. He has his own home, which is located in a rural area. More than 15 years ago, Eler began in the blacksmith\u2019s trade. In an environment he set up in his home, he has various machines that allow him to build doors, windows, tables, and other things from metal. He thinks his business is profitable, since he invests little in raw material. \u201cWhat they mostly ask me for is repairs to metal items, such as chairs, tables, and tricycles; but at the start of the month they ask me to build doors and windows\u201d, he says proudly. Thanks to this work, he managed to give his son an education. On the busiest days he contracts day labourers, whom he pays for their services; otherwise he would not be able to finish his work. He likes his work, so he needs your help to acquire more material.

successfully repaid a loan twice and says with this new loan requested, she will expand her pig farm by buying more piglets, expand her provision store in her compound, buy firewood for resale, and also engage in the sale of cooked food. She has a positive view of her business succeeding because she has been doing it for a long time, she has experience in the businesses, she has a good business site, and she has a good approach that encourages her customers to buy on a regular basis. With this business activity, the community will buy her products and she will also sell at cheaper prices to her customers.\n\nWith the profit from this loan, she will pay her children's school fees, cater to the feeding of her family, provide medication to her family, pay her bills and also engage in farm work.

She buys general merchandise from wholesalers and sells it with a little profit. Her products are men's and women\u2019s clothes and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy because of the low selling prices and the many options she offers. She also has a direct selling business and an electronic loading station for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 60,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy ready-to-wear clothing for her business. She will also use the loan to buy supplies and merchandise products for her direct selling business.\r\n\r\nJoan dreams to expand her business and hopes to give a good life to her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She has been a farmer for almost 14 years and usually earns a net profit of $5.00 per day. The house she lives in has deteriorated over the years and it needs some renovation.

","en":"Karomat is 56 years old.  He was born in Shahrituz and lives there with his family to this day.  Karomat is involved in farming.  He grows agricultural crops on his land plot.  In order to improve his family's budget, he is planning to start a new parallel business in feeding and selling cattle.  He will keep animals at home, on a livestock yard.
