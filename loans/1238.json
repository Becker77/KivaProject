She was left alone with two small children. She had no job and so went to Russia to make a living. After several years, she again returned to her homeland and started a business. Elmira has over 3 years of experience in buying and selling produce. Elmira's working day starts in the early morning and ends late at night. Elmira is trying to improve the living conditions for her children. She does not have an apartment and therefore wants to buy an apartment. With this goal, she has applied for a loan.

She has a secondary education and has been involved in sewing for 15 years.  She makes and sells national goods, clothing and dowry for brides.  She has a lot of work experience in this business.  Nazilkan gained sufficient experience and clients in this business.  Nazilkan had her own small, national-dress sewing factory at the central market, which provided 15 jobs for people.  The business was running well, but a fire happened inside the factory on January 28, 2013.  It was impossible to put the fire out in time, and the business burned down completely, including the factory itself, equipment, materials, fabrics and accessories.  Luckily, none of the people were hurt.  Nazilkan did not give up in this difficult situation.  She strongly got through this and then, putting all of her efforts together, started to work hard to restore her business.  The multi-year experience, strong character and relatives helped Nazilkan to get back on her feet.  Eight months have passed since the fire, and Nazilkan was able to install a new a container, where 4 seamstresses work.  The business is gradually improving, and Nazilkan dreams to further develop and strengthen her business.  Nazilkan needs money to purchase fabrics for sewing national clothing and increase her goods turnover.  Having heard about the favorable Kiva \u201cForce-Major\u201d program, Nazilkan requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \u201cBai-Tushum and Partners\u201d to purchase fabrics for sewing national goods.   Based on her business plan, Nazilkan would earn about 20,000 KGS per month.  She plans to invest the earnings into further increasing her business.

He is married and has one son. Telman is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his family in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He is a Fuzulu refugee. He has been growing vegetables and fruits for more than 10 years. He is very hard-working and passionate about his work. He considers it fun to grow potatoes, tomatoes and cucumbers and to plant fruit trees with his wife. He sells his crops in the central bazaar to make profits, in order to support his family. Telman \u2019s income from business is 130 AZN. In order to improve the living conditions of his family, he plans to expand his business. This requires a lot of dedication and effort.

Her oldest son is attending his last year in a university, and the second son is serving in the army.  She had to find work and feed the family.  She thought for a long time how to earn money and finally decided to organize her own business in buying and selling dairy products.  She brought dairy products from her district to the city market and sold them there.  Gradually she developed her business and started an additional business in animal husbandry.  She helped her son to finish the university and was able to support two children in difficult times.  Iklim is a driven and strong woman.  She is gradually improving her living conditions.  She wants to purchase furniture for her family.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of 6000 somoni to purchase furniture.

For the past two years, Bahemuka has been working hard to manage her small food stall, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Bahemuka has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food, such as raw bananas and sweet potatoes, to add to her business. This will help Bahemuka to generate greater profits and develop her business more. Bahemuka hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nBahemuka is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1440191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married and has three sons. He is an IDP and lives in Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. Sevindik has been breeding cattle and milk cows for the past 25 years.  He learned to operate a small business from his parents. He continued working in the same business after he was married. Through a lot of sacrifice, he has become one of the leading producers of agriculture for the area in which he lives. With the income from the business, he has been able to raise cattle successfully.\r\n\r\nHis monthly income is 120 AZN, and this business is the only source of financial income for his family.

He has been working in construction, specializing in painting work, since nineteen years ago. He was only fifteen years old when he started this kind of work. Because he had to help his family in covering their expenses, he had to quit school during his intermediate studies.\r\n\r\nAli is working hard to improve his family\u2019s living, and his painting business isn\u2019t good enough to cover the unexpected needs that have arisen. So he thought of starting a new, extra business, which he believes will provide him with a good income throughout the whole year.

Her children are already independent and she lives in her own house with her husband. Luri works selling beef in a stall in the main market of her town and she takes care of her clients in a very friendly way. She started her business 10 years ago investing her own capital because she needed to generate her own income. Her husband helped her economically in the beginning. Little by little her income started to grow  and the quality of the meat she was selling improved. Initially, she took care of her clients alone but now her husband helps her too. She enjoys her business because it allows her to interact with people and because it makes it possible for her to contribute with the household expenses. However, she is not comfortable with some of her clients asking for loans for their purchases and, because she had problems with that in the past, she doesn't accept that kind of payment anymore. Her objective is to supply her business and continue to grow and generate more income. This is the second loan she requests to Kiva. She is very happy to have the economic support she needs to move forward and she promises to pay her fees punctually. With the requested amount of 3000 nuevos soles, she will buy a meat-cutting serrated knife to improve the quality of the products she sells. In addition, she will buy more meat in order to continue with her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1445921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a work tool and wholesale meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-05T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-04T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":459.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":469.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":494.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":507.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":525.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":544.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168.32,"local_amount":459.06,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":467.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905733},{"amount":172.04,"local_amount":469.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":478.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091716},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":494.31,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":503.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778312},{"amount":310.93,"local_amount":848,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":864.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147640},{"amount":67.95,"local_amount":185.32,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-06T10:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":188.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240731},{"amount":199.51,"local_amount":544.11,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-03T11:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":554.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258668}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T18:05:35Z","paid_date":"2015-04-03T11:01:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Gasca","image":null}},{"id":613010,"name":"Hussein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hussein is a 29-year-old Lebanese single man living with his parents.

She is married and has four children who are 18, 16, 12 and 8 years old. In 2005, Isata B. established her school bags, traveling bags and ladies bags business. She began her business because she inherited it from her mother and since she was not fortunate enough to go to school, she decided to use the business as her own career.   \r\n\r\nWorking six days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about 1,800,000 Le (Sierra Leone leones) every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 6,000,000. Isata requires a loan in order to buy more bags. She was able to secure another sales outlet out of the profit she made from the previous loan, which is run by her cousin. Her plan of becoming an agent has not materialized, but she is still on it.

He lives with his brother and mother in a small village in the Zestaponi district. The family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have 2 cows and hens. His mother milks the cows every day and produces dairy products to sell. In addition, they have a vineyard and a 0.7 hectare plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. Sadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Lasha was unable to study for a professional career. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Lasha decided to start his own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful, because of his poor living conditions. A start-up program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get loans for starting or re-starting businesses.

Her parents hoped that she would continue her education and go to college; however, her family's economic situation does not allow it at this time.  Undaunted, she has set another goal for herself: to open her own sewing shop.  This line of work suits her, as she learned how to make women's clothing from her mother when she was a child.  She is a clever girl, and is confident that she has what it takes to manage her own business.  She has taken a course titled \"Attain Success\"; it was organized by an association for businesswomen, and Zulola received a certificate upon completing the course.  To help set up her business, she is requesting a loan to buy a sewing machine and various kinds of fabric.

Her husband is a sweeper so she decided to work for herself to support her family for a better future. Twelve years ago she started doing stitching work in her house. She stitches for the people living around her house and uses the income to support her entire family.  However, due to lack of availability of funds she is unable to meet the daily demands of her customers. Amber has borrowed 20,000 PKR from Kashf Foundation.

He lives with his wife and son in a small village in the Senaki district. The family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a cow and two calves. His wife milks the cows every day and produces dairy products to sell. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources, and because he had to start working at a very young age, Iason was unable to study for a professional career.  As the family has only seasonal income, Iason decided to start selling clothes and sought credit among local financial institutions. However, his attempts were unsuccessful, because of his poor living conditions. The start-up program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get loans for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 900 USD. He will purchase clothes to sell with the loan.

She has five children and has been doing this work for 25 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is that it is a source of income. Her biggest challenge is lack of a market. Animals on the farm have been given no names.\r\n\r\nAlice was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Because it trains clients before giving loans.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"How to manage finances and not to divert them.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

The harvested products are sold to local retailers. As the income is only seasonal, Sophiko decided to request a loan for the family business. The Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, enables her to get a loan of $2,400 for purchasing a used car.

She is married and has 3 children who are all currently in school. For the past 4 years, Rose has been working hard to manage her boutique, selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more clothes to sell, and will help Rose to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another branch of the same business. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

He lives with his wife and two children (his son is 21 years old and his daughter is 13 years old). \r\n\r\nSargis sustains his living by trading tuff stones. He purchases stones from a tuff quarry of the Aragatsotn region and sells them to local people in Armavir town. Sargis has also a big number of customers in Yerevan town. He has been doing this business for 15 years. Sargis's wife works at a local school as a teacher and tries to help her husband in sustaining the family's living. \r\n\r\nCurrently Sargis and his family are facing financial big difficulties. Sargis has no money for purchasing tires for his truck so he is asking this loan.\r\n\r\nHe has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

She is 23 years old and single. Hellen owns a cosmetics shop and a clothes business that she started three years ago. Her business has been doing well. \r\n\r\nHellen learned of Milango Financial Services through friends, who invited her to join so that they could save and be able to access credit to fund their business.

The loan will be used to stock more food in the restaurant to sell, and will help Margret generate greater profits and pay her children's school fees. Margret hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand the business into a motel. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Margret who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1440471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock more food for the restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-10-05T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-04T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margret ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.8,"local_amount":415659,"processed_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":416794.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420924089},{"amount":85.84,"local_amount":219156,"processed_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":219754.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429470713},{"amount":88.93,"local_amount":227072,"processed_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T09:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":227692.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440156158},{"amount":92.15,"local_amount":235273,"processed_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":235915.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449600770},{"amount":194.4,"local_amount":496347,"processed_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":497702.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467879106},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":261699,"processed_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":262413.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479102429},{"amount":106.2,"local_amount":271151,"processed_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":271891.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490797126},{"amount":110.04,"local_amount":280945,"processed_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":281712.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504219440},{"amount":114.01,"local_amount":291092,"processed_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-24T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":291886.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519782961},{"amount":118.13,"local_amount":301606,"processed_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":302429.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529988548}],"funded_date":"2013-10-23T13:44:07Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:39:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neda Elaidi","image":1353963}},{"id":613158,"name":"Jasmena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jasmena is a nurse from Metsamor town.

The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, makes Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nMagaret is married and has seven children. Her husband has retired from his job as an agricultural supervisor, and now works with her in farming their land.

He continued his studies in Morristown, but wasn\u2019t able to complete his degree after two years. At the time, Sandro had started his own computer repair business but put it on hold to work as a full-time painter, which provided more consistent income.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sandro began repairing computers again on nights and weekends using the substantial customer base he had built over the years. Though he still paints during the day, he runs a small computer repair operation out of his basement.

In 2000, using an initial investment of 25,000 KGS, the couple started their business of selling groceries.  Owing to Gulbara's ability to successfully expand her business and obtain regular clients, she is currently making 20,000 KGS per month.  \r\n\r\nThanks to their hard work, Gulbara and her husband were able to successfully marry off their daughters while advancing their business forward.  With the goal of further expanding her business, Gulbara applied for a loan of 135,000 KGS from the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum and Partners.  She is planning to use this loan to purchase groceries that she can sell in her shop.

","en":"Muhabbat is from the Spitamen region of Tajikistan.  She is 53 years old, and lives together with her husband, 3 daughters, and her son.  Her husband works in a cotton-processing factory as a press operator, whereas Muhabbat bakes flatbread in a bakery and sells it at a local market.  She is currently a tenant on a 2-hectare plot of land where she grows rice.  \r\n\r\nLately, Muhabbat has been thinking it would be a good idea to start raising livestock at home.  She has no previous experience doing so, but her neighbors do, and are willing to help her if need be; nearly two-thirds of the population in Spitamen raise livestock.  Muhabbat will be using her own money to build a cow shed and buy cattle feed for her new business, and hopes to use a loan to buy cattle (4 cows and 4 calves).

She is married to Salvador, a messenger, and they have children who are all in school. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are both working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nCharina Rosario is an egg retailer. What she basically does is buy egg from wholesalers and then sells them with a little profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices she offered. She also has a variety store for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nCharina Rosario is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 25,000 that she will use to purchase additional stocks of eggs. She will also use the loan in buying grocery items and toiletries for her variety store.\r\n\r\nCharina Rosario hopes to be successful in life and business and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

Ainura has higher education, and works as a teacher at the local school. As an additional income for her family, Ainura works with livestock breeding, after having started 10 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ainura's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows, a mare, 10 sheep and also a plot of land of 1.18 hectares. Here she grows peppers, potatoes and clover every year.

She is married to Antonio, a worker abroad, and they have children. She manages their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth amount of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 900 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nTeresita hopes that her business will continue to flourish and dreams that her children will have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week.

Her partner is Antonio and they have child. She, together with her partner, manages their household while operating the business. They are both working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSheryl operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by pieces. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php700 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php9,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nSheryl dreams to have more customers who will patronize her business and hopes that her child will always be in good health and have a good education.

Mongolia. He has been working as a carpenter for three years since he retired from work. All of his three children live separately on their own. The house Chogdoo and his wife live in has been deteriorating over the years and it needs some serious repair, so he is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, he will repair and insulate his old house. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating and will release less pollutants into the atmosphere.

Her husband is Efren, a worker abroad and they have children. She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she and her husband are working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nChona operates a general merchandise store. What she basically does is buy different items such as accessories, toys, school supplies, and beauty products from wholesalers and sell them per piece\/pack for a profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are students and mall patrons. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy different items such as accessories, toys, school supplies and beauty products needed in her store.\r\n \r\nChona hopes that her business will grow bigger and have another branch.

Asylkan has vocational training, and has been involved in livestock production as her main source of income, starting with one cow that she purchased 20 years ago for 5,000 Kyrgyzstani som (KGS). Thanks to Asylkan's hard work, her farm now contains two cows, one horse, one mare, one colt, 30 sheep and a 1.28 hectare plot of land that each year produces potatoes, beans and perennial grasses. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of expanding her farm, Asylkan has turned to microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy cows for cattle breeding. With the income from the loan, Asylkan plans to invest in growing the number of cattle on her farm, and plans to save money for her son's wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1445270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kaiyndy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-06T02:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-05T02:50:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":57.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asylkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":8189.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942648},{"amount":165.48,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":8189.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.52,"payment_id":467830948},{"amount":168,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:11:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8189.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178237},{"amount":164.35,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8189.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.65,"payment_id":542440230},{"amount":150.4,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8189.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.6,"payment_id":595435865},{"amount":176.47,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10236.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.53,"payment_id":636160949}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T20:18:03Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:41:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Max Prilutsky","image":1270958}},{"id":613412,"name":"Leonia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonia, 26, is applying for a loan of $1,000 to improve her business.

He works from 6am to 9pm each working day, and is able to make a very good profit each month. \r\n\r\nThis will be his 6th loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used his previous loans to open a fruit and vegetables business which closed, and then he open a cafe. Jackson also bought more fabrics for his tailoring business and has paid back all his previous loans successfully. With the business profit received, he will pay for school fees, household expenses and build a house. Jackson will use this loan to buy more drinks for his cafe and more fabrics for tailoring. He dreams that one day will be able to expand his businesses by open another better one. \r\n\r\nHe will share this loan with his loan group\" Serakazi\" which totals ten members.

her husband has owned an enterprise of stitching and selling embroidery by machine in his nearby town. He has been recruiting workers for embroidery work on daily wages. He is very expert in his profession. He aslo knits bridal dresses, and people like him for his arts and appreciate his efforts. Now, the marriage season is going to start with lots of demand. He wants to cope with the demand for bridal dresses, which is why he wants to buy stocks of threads, fancy cloths, sequins, and pearls of various colors.\r\n \r\nRehana requires some capital to buy the desired inventories for her husband, but she does not have a sufficient amount. So she made a humble request to Kiva's field partner, BRAC Pakistan for a loan. Through this loan her husband would be able to buy stocks of threads, fancy cloths, sequins, and pearls of various colors. Rehana is very glad and thankful to BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1440898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy pearls, sequins, and threads of various colors.

He lives with his wife and daughter in a small village in the Kvareli district. His wife trades in clothing and earns 200-250 GEL per month. His daughter is an invalid and gets a pension of 70 GEL per month for medicine. Gia is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has a 0.35 hectare of land where he grows maize to sell. In addition, Gia has a horse and brings wood from the forest by horse to sell. As the existing income is not enough for the family, Gia requested a loan to purchase two cows.

is aged 34 years and lives in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. She is the mother of five children and is passing her life very smooth and calmly. \r\nHer husband owns a canteen in the school; he offers canteen items such as burgers, samosas, finger chips, ketchup, salad, rice, cold drinks, and juices. The students like to eat spicy food at recess time; he is earning sufficient income to feed his family.  After the school timing, he is unable to sell his items because his canteen is inside the school, so he wants to open a burger point near his house, but he does not have savings to buy burgers, salad, ketchup, eggs, and a stall to offer burgers to common persons. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Shazia requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can buy burgers, salad, ketchup, eggs, and a stall. Shazia hopes that this burger point will work very well and will be the cause of increase in income.
