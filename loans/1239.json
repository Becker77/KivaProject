For the past 10 years, Teddy has been working hard to manage her small retail shop, which sells charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Teddy has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more sacks of charcoal to sell, and will help Teddy to generate greater profits and start collecting charcoal from the forest on her own rather than sending other people to do that for her. Teddy hopes that in the future she will be able to improve on their standards of living. \r\n\r\nTeddy is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Teddy who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1440996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock more sacks of charcoal to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Seeta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 31.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-10-06T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-05T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teddy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":170102},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":176246},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":182612},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":189208},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":196042},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":203123},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":210459},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":218061},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":225937},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":234098},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":242553},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":251559}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":135.08,"local_amount":346348,"processed_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":347685.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420924090},{"amount":71.21,"local_amount":182612,"processed_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":183317.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429470714},{"amount":73.8,"local_amount":189208,"processed_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T09:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":189938.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440156159},{"amount":76.45,"local_amount":196042,"processed_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":196798.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449600771},{"amount":79.22,"local_amount":203126,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":203910.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479102430},{"amount":65.57,"local_amount":168129,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":168778.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490797127},{"amount":77.86,"local_amount":199647,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-24T09:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":200417.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519782962},{"amount":387.78,"local_amount":1014882,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1018800.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.03,"payment_id":595124687}],"funded_date":"2013-10-27T22:04:30Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:44:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":613503,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mom is 39 years old.

For the last two  months, she has around $ 5 - 10 per day in sales on average (just mobile phone airtime credit sales). Recently, she took a loan from Kiva to get a printer to support her business selling mobile phone airtime credits and serving bill payments (household electricity payments).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1441099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile

Flor sells soft drinks of various flavors and brands, selling them cold to please her customers. She has a fridge that she bought with her savings to do this, which is installed in her house. She serves them in a warm and friendly manner knowing that this treatment will win her the loyalty of her customers. \r\n\r\nFlor started six years ago with a private loan, which helped her make her initial purchases. Seeing how welcome her business was, she re-invested the profits buying in greater quantity. She has had the help of her husband up to now. Flor comments that before opening her business, she had no problems but wanted to have an occupation to pass the time. Also she wanted to have her own income to help her husband with the expenses and not to be totally dependent on him.\r\n\r\nThis is Flor's fourth loan with Kiva and she is grateful to be able to count on this financial assistance. It makes her feel more secure that she can improve her business. She promises to pay her installments on time. She will use the 1500 PEN to buy tables and chairs for her soft drinks

To cut the transportation costs he needs to pay others, he would like to buy his own vehicle; a motorcycle-wagon, which is a 3-wheeled vehicle with a large flatbed on the back that allows for the transportation of heavy goods, boxes.\r\n\r\nTo be able to pay for the purchase, he is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq, and hopes to see higher profits generated after the cut of third party involvement in his activities.    \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients who are unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients, and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.

After her husband's death, she alone raised their three children in addition to running her own business.  Astra has a university education and she worked as a merchandise expert for a long time.  She is now retired but runs a business at home.  Her family's main income is Astra's animal husbandry business, which she started 23 years ago with the purchase of 10,000 somi (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Astra has 2 milking cows, 1 calf, 2 sheep, as well as 1.70 HA of land where every year she grows potatoes.  Her monthly income comes to 15,000 somi (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to developing her business further, Astra applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 somi (KGS) to help her with the harvest.  More precisely, she intends to collect the harvest with hired labor.  She will hire several people who will help her collect the harvest and she wants to pay them for their work.  Astra plans to invest the profits from her loan in further increasing the size of her herd and to save for her daughter's

After her husband's death, she alone raised their 7 children in addition to running her own business.  Kanikey has a secondary level education, and her family's main source of income is from her animal husbandry business, which she started 21 years ago with a purchase of 1,000 somi (KGS) worth of cattle.

She and her husband are raising 5 children.  Nurzina has a secondary level education and her family's main source of income is her animal husbandry business, which she started 15 years ago with the purchase of 6,000 somi (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Nurzina has 2 milking cows, 10 sheep, and 3.0 HA of land where every year she grows beans.  Her monthly income comes to 15,000 somi (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to developing her business further, Nurzina applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 somi (KGS), which she will use to collect her harvest.  More precisely, she intends to collect the harvest with the help of hired labor.  She will hire several people who will help her collect the harvest and she wants to pay them for their work.  Nurzina plans in invest the profits from the loan in further increasing the size of her herd and to save up some money for repairing their home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1445310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to hire laborers for the harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bakiyan village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-06T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-05T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurzina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4339},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3719},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3815},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3914},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4015},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4119},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4225},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4334},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4446},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4561},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4679},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3834}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.12,"local_amount":4339,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4441.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777251},{"amount":158.21,"local_amount":7534,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":7712.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427103},{"amount":82.2,"local_amount":3914,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4006.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553150},{"amount":168.06,"local_amount":8134,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8326.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.75,"payment_id":459019613},{"amount":88.73,"local_amount":4225,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4325.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053358},{"amount":91.01,"local_amount":4334,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4436.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749511},{"amount":93.37,"local_amount":4446,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4551.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178239},{"amount":95.78,"local_amount":4561,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4669.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462858},{"amount":97.69,"local_amount":4679,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4789.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.57,"payment_id":529946882},{"amount":78.76,"local_amount":3834,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3924.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.75,"payment_id":542440233}],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T12:49:16Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":613630,"name":"Stephen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stephen lives on a farm outside of Kakamega town, in Kakamega county.

Kenjetay has a secondary education and her family's main source of income is Kenjetay's animal husbandry business, which she started 27 years ago with the purchase of 1,500 somi (KGS) worth of cattle.  Thanks to Kenjetay's hard work, today she has 1 milking cow, 1 mare, and 1.20 HA of land where every year she grows peppers, beans, cabbage, and clover.  Her monthly income comes to 12,000 somi (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to developing her business further, Kenjetay applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 somi (KGS) to buy cows.  Kenjetay plans to invest the profits from her loan in further increasing the size of her herd and to save up money for her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1445322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balasary village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-06T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-05T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenjetay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7446},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7269},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7487},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7712},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7943},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8182},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8427},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8680},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8940},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9209},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9485},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":305.34,"local_amount":14715,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":14884.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427105},{"amount":155.35,"local_amount":7487,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7573.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942651},{"amount":160.03,"local_amount":7712,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":7800.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553152},{"amount":162.15,"local_amount":7943,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":8034.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.66,"payment_id":459019615},{"amount":167.23,"local_amount":8182,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8276.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.55,"payment_id":467830951},{"amount":174.86,"local_amount":8427,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8524,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053360},{"amount":180.11,"local_amount":8680,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8779.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749513},{"amount":185.5,"local_amount":8940,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":9042.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178241},{"amount":579.22,"local_amount":27914,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":28235.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462860}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T15:44:09Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:25:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":613644,"name":"Tigran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tigran is from Kapan town where he lives with his wife and three children.

She also wants to enjoy a better quality of life with her family in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1445844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-06T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-05T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Myriam Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":89671},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":92156},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":94710},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":97334},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100031},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":102803},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":105652},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":108579},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111588},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":114680},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":117858},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":121124},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":124480},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":127929},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":131474},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135117},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":138862},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":142709},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":146664},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150728},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":154905},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":159197},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":163608},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":168141}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":613623,"name":"Elene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elene is a 42-year-old married woman.

Since her husband's death, she alone has been raising their two children as well as running her own business.  Alima has a secondary level education and her family's main source of income is Alima's animal husbandry business, which she started 14 years ago with the purchase of 8,000 somi (KGS) worth of cattle.

She works at her business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is a lack of capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to purchase more sodium, fertilizer and seeds for her gardening business.

With this housing loan he is able to take, and with his business profits, he can pay for the home improvements and save for more. The other members of his group are recommending him for a housing loan to start with the house construction. Now he will finish building his house by adding doors and windows, and cover the concrete block with cement.\r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings. Jose lives together with his long term partner. He thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity. In his name and that of his family, he thanks all of you for your support!

He plans to purchase new stock of knitwear, but has insufficient funds for that. So, Armen has requested this loan to be able to purchase new stock of knitwear.

Her family consists of her husband, daughter, and son. The latter currently is in the army. Araqsi's daughter is a university student. Araqsi has been a teacher in the local school for several years. Her husband works in the village's self-governance body. All the family works hard to be able to cover their basic needs. Araqsi is also engaged in cultivation of wheat, cucumber, and several fruits (peach, apricot, plum, grapes, apple and pear). \r\n\r\nShe currently needs a loan of USD 2,500 to purchase fertilizers, some materials for cultivation of grapes (wires, trestles, layers of grapes), and to pay for the harvesting services. The loan will help her greatly to sustain her agribusiness. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back.

Janett also has an electronic loading station for additional income.\r\n\r\nJanett would like to apply for another 25,000 PHP loan to purchase raw ingredients such as rice, pork, chicken, vegetables and other products needed in her business. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and pay for the educational expenses of her child. Janett looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJanett dreams of being more successful in her business and hopes that her child will finish his studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week so that she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance

Tamano decided to start earning money as well. As there is a barn for holding livestock in the backyard of their house, Tamano wants to practice animal husbandry, specifically raising sheep. She thinks that sheep rearing is not overly time-consuming and does not require a lot of effort. It is a very profitable business for those who do it, as lamb meat is always in demand. In order to start her business, Tamano is requesting a loan. She plans to buy 15 sheep every month, and after the course of a month, fatten them up and resell them at the livestock market. Thanks to the loan, she will have her own business with a stabile income, which will allow her to increase her family's budget.

agriculture production. She has two children and has been doing this work for 20 years. Her primary income sources are milk and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"[The] good market for produce.\" Her biggest challenge is poor transportation. An animal on the farm has been given the name of Mwari.\r\n\r\nKarimi was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Better services.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Savings are used as collateral.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

She makes her cash or credit sales at the retail level to a customer base compose essentially of consumers at her home, at the market, and at the surrounding fairs.\r\n\r\nFANTA hopes to make a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA that will be used to help her husband to meet family needs, pay back the loan, and reinvest in the business.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1446910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase gains to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625072},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851085},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740738},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740739},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045225},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263082},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490959992},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490959993},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504676661}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T16:19:10Z","paid_date":"2014-07-18T09:31:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":616886,"name":"Jipe Moyo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Mambehe est une commer\u00e7ante et membre d\u2019une association  d\u2019affaires  \u00abJipe Moyo \u00bb, femme mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e  de 35 ans, m\u00e8re des cinq enfants qui tous \u00e9tudient.
