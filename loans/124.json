It has been in existence for approximately 14 years and has 12 members. Its president is Albertina Y. who makes traditional handicrafts featuring scenes of villages, llamas, etc., on a loom or frame. She says that she started her business about 20 years ago but in recent years her production has decreased because she isn't able to find a market in which to put up her products. So she is requesting a small loan to buy wool. In the future she would like to change businesses. The rest of the members of the group also have different businesses such as selling vegetables, running a store, clothes making, and sweater making. They need the loan to purchase foods, raw materials, and merchandise. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Shimmin, Kiva

C. is from the village of Cabaruan. He is 58 years old. Nicolas is married. To make a living, Nicolas owns & operates a business venture in the services sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing electrical repairs in the local community. Nicolas has been engaged in his business for several years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nicolas joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nicolas is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Nicolas from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is a young entrepreneur who is married to Lupe, who is 20 years old.  They have two young children and live in their own home where they have established a coffee nursery so that they could obtain additional income from their sales.\r\n<p>\r\nFreddy is aware that the care he provides to his crops is crucial to obtaining good results.  Beginning in the early morning hours, with machete in hand, Freddy goes out to inspect his fields of coffee, bananas, cassava, and avocado.  While he wanders across his farm, his wife stays at home to look after their children.  He has been farming for six years and it has provided him great satisfaction since he considers it to be a profitable livelihood.  What he enjoys most is keeping his crops free of weeds, insects, and a few rodents.  Sometime later, he would like to reopen the grocery store that he and his wife managed so that they can peacefully cover their household expenses.  This will allow them to save the money earned from their agricultural production so that they can acquire more property.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP.   Freddy is a responsible person who has earned the trust of his Communal Bank and leads his group in enforcing the rules fairly so that they are better organized.  They are happy because he is an example to follow.  With the loan of 2000 PEN that he requested, he will invest in the gathering of coffee beans to sell in large quantities.  With the earnings, he will acquire food products needed to reopen his grocery store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":505598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Pay to gather coffee beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2052.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153892}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T00:50:36Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":188588,"name":"Marcelino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Marcelino Padr\u00f3n es casado con la se\u00f1ora Nicolasa y son un matrimonio unido y establecido, viven solitos ya que sus hijos est\u00e1n casados; el labora para una empresa de venta de libros y realiza gestiones de cobranza, adem\u00e1s cuenta con un ingreso extra ya que tiene un negocio propio donde realiza productos de herrer\u00eda tales como puertas, portones,ventanas, etc. el se\u00f1or Marcelino es un cliente distinguido de nuestra instituci\u00f3n ya que anteriormente se le otorgo un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de material para su negocio y nuevamente esta solicitando para invertir en el mediante la compra de pintura y acabados.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The daily earnings, which reach Rp.20,000-Rp.30,000 (~US $2-3) help sustain the household, because her husband has a modest occupation as a farmer.   \r\n\r\n   <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNi Nyoman Danti adalah  sosok ibu rumah tangga yang tekun dan ulet dalam menjalankan usaha warung.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mientras que su esposa va detr\u00e1s de \u00e9l con sus vacas y dem\u00e1s animales llevando el almuerzo, con esta labor pudo educar a sus hijos que ahora viven en diferentes ciudades y se siente muy orgulloso de ellos.

He has 6 children, two of whom still live with him and help with the crops.  His work begins at 5 am, at which time he removes the grass and starts his planting areas.  After this work is complete, he returns to his house at 8 am to eat breakfast, then returns to the farm again to complete his tasks.  His wife follows with his cows and other animals, bringing him lunch.  Through these labors, he was able to educate his children who now live in other cities; he is very proud of them.  During the current season, he is planting 1 \u00bd bags of pea seeds called \u201cSuper Improved\u201d which are resistant to humidity.  He will plant about the same quantity next month, but from a different type of seed.  He uses this staggered technique so he will continually have a harvest and, as a result, a more consistent level of income.  When there is not much farm work to be done, Sixto works in construction.  He builds adobe homes, for example, from the months of June through September.  This is his third loan with MFP and, under the directive of the president of his cooperative bank, he works very responsibly to make sure all members make their payments on the designated date.  As a result of these efforts, the group has not fallen into delinquency.  With the funds he is requesting he will purchase pea seeds that cost 600.00 Peruvian soles per bag, and he will use the remaining funds to buy insecticides to fumigate his crops.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":260083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase seeds and insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T15:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sixto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1721.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210826}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T17:36:27Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":89426,"name":"Sanovbar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sanovbar is a lovely 56-year-old woman who lives with her three children.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

In regards to her family she helps her grandchildren achieve a great education, however, Alba recognizes that she has a challenge when it's time to adjust her expenses, already allocated when the sales go down.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":625254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise to display on her store to get ready for the Holiday Season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-27T05:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":42248},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":46285},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":47057},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":47841},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48638},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":49449},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50273},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":51111},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":51963},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":52829},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":53709},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58597}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.85},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.32},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.64,"local_amount":88533,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":93811.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688415},{"amount":27.45,"local_amount":47057,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-18T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":49862.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427632},{"amount":27.91,"local_amount":47841,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50693.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001051},{"amount":28.37,"local_amount":48638,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":51538.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289062},{"amount":28.85,"local_amount":49449,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52397.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157213},{"amount":29.33,"local_amount":50273,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":53270.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230218},{"amount":29.81,"local_amount":51111,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:33Z","rounded_local_amount":54158.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673318},{"amount":30.31,"local_amount":51963,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":55061.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319880},{"amount":30.82,"local_amount":52829,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":55978.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803039},{"amount":65.51,"local_amount":112306,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":119002.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614135}],"funded_date":"2010-10-27T13:36:16Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":245970,"name":"Teddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teddy is a 44-year-old, married mother of four living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

la vida, vive en su propia casa y lo que m\u00e1s desea es obtener mejores ingresos para as\u00ed darle una buena estabilidad econ\u00f3mica a su futura familia. Jovita en la toma fotogr\u00e1fica sale expuesta con una gorra, debido a un accidente, caus\u00e1ndole  fisuras en el enc\u00e9falo craneano y alrededor de la vista, por ello no desea ser fotografiada.  La actividad a la que se dedica Jovita es el cultivo de las plantas de caf\u00e9, cacao y frutas c\u00edtricas; plantas y tierras que hered\u00f3 de sus padres. Desde entonces labra sus cultivos con el apoyo de los jornaleros quienes se dedican a sacar la maleza, cosechar y trasladar los productos hasta las carreteras para luego ser transportados en triciclos o carretillas. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la libertad que tiene en el desempe\u00f1o de su labor, ya que ella decide que es lo mejor para sus cultivos. Lleva 05 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es combatir con las plaga de insectos que se apoderan de los brotes de sus cultivos. Pero ahora lo que m\u00e1s prioriza es comprar nuevas tierras para incrementar sus cultivos.

Con los 1,000 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 semillas de cacao y caf\u00e9.\n\n","en":"Jovita is 26 years old.  She is a happy, hard-working, single young lady with an eagerness to succeed in life.  She lives in her own house and greatly wishes to earn more in order to be able to provide her future family with a stable income.  In the photo, Jovita appears with a cap because of an accident which caused fractures on her skull and around her eyes.  As such, she did not wish to be photographed.  \r\n\r\nJovita works in the cultivation of coffee, cacao, and citrus fruit plants; lands which she inherited from her parents.  She works on her fields with the help of day laborers, who remove the weeds, harvest, and transport the products to the roads, where they are then transported in tricycles and wheelbarrows.  What she enjoys most about her work is the liberty that she has in the management of her fields, since she gets to decide what is best for her cultivations.  She has been doing this for over 5 years and considers the most difficult part to combating the insects that eat her plants.  But for now, her priority is to purchase new land in order to increase her cultivations.

They also use the thread to embroider beautiful and colorful flowers on the blouses that are worn in the high plains of Guatemala. <p>\r\nThe women who have convenience stores use the money they borrow to replenish inventory.  They all buy laundry detergent, beans, rice, sugar, cooking oil and other products used in the home.  But some of the women with a more entrepreneurial vision also buy products that can\u2019t be found in other stores, like prepaid cards for cellular phones, cereals, deli items and even shrimp.<p>\r\nThe Guineales women say that they like working with Friendship Bridge because of the convenience to pay back the loan in payments due every 42 days with no interest plus, the training they have received helps them grow their businesses.  They also mention that they like working together because they all pay on time and feel like they have formed a solid group. <p>\r\nThis is a special group of women to which Friendship Bridge has given the opportunity to grow.  Nevertheless, it will be thanks to the money you are going to invest in them that will help this group succeed.  Thank you for supporting and believing in them.\u2028\u2028<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres que agrupan el banco comunal Las Guineales se juntan cada tres semanas a las afueras de una casa de adobe. Su lugar de encuentra se ubica al costado de la cocina de do\u00f1a Manuela G., la cual est\u00e1 constantemente cocinando tamales para venderlos a un muy m\u00f3dico precio al resto de sus compa\u00f1eras. \r\n\r\n<P>La casa donde se lleva acabo los encuentros se encuentra en una aldea muy retirada en la costa de Guatemala y lastimosamente es asediada, ocasionalmente, por delincuentes. Sin embargo, la aldea los Guineales est\u00e1 bendita con una tierra muy productiva. Este dicho lugar est\u00e1 cubierto por cafetales que cuando est\u00e1n reto\u00f1ando sus frutos colorean la aldea de rojo. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de mujeres tienen la caracter\u00edstica de ser muy organizadas y a pesar de que reflejan una imagen seria al principio, regalan sonrisas cuando entran en confianza. Las integrantes de este grupo invierten su cr\u00e9dito en dos actividades mayormente: tejidos y tiendas de conveniencia. \r\n\r\n<P>Las clientas que trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para comprar hilo. Con este hilo ellas tejen los trajes tradicionales de Guatemala, utilizando la t\u00e9cnica de telar de cintura. Tambi\u00e9n, usan el hilo para bordar bellas y coloridas flores en las blusas que se utilizan en el altiplano de Guatemala. \r\n\r\n<P>En lo que respecta a la actividad de tiendas de conveniencia. Las clientas utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para completar el inventario de sus respectivas tiendas. Todas ellas compran jab\u00f3n para lavar ropa, frijoles, arroz, az\u00facar, aceite, entre otros productos que se utilizan en el hogar. Sin embargo, algunas clientas con visi\u00f3n empresarial compran productos que no se encuentran en otras tiendas, como tarjetas de celular prepago, cereales, embutidos y hasta camarones. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres Guineales dicen que les gusta trabajar con Friendship Bridge porque tienen la facilidad de pagar en cuotas de cuarenta y dos d\u00edas cada una, les acomoda el inter\u00e9s y las capacitaciones que han recibido las ayuda a que su negocio crezca. Ellas tambi\u00e9n mencionaron que, les gusta trabajar juntas porque todas pagan puntualmente y sienten que se ha formado un grupo consolidado. \r\n\r\n<P>Este es un grupo especial de mujeres al cual Friendship Bridge les ha dado una oportunidad de crecer. Sin embargo, va a ser gracias al capital que se ustedes van a invertir en ellas que va a impulsar a este grupo al \u00e9xito. Gracias por apoyarlas y creer en ellas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":149431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

After many attempts, we could not stop laughing while taking a picture. This is the best one of the bunch.\r\n<P>\r\nMaureen sells fish in the Oyala market \u2013 located on a roundabout in downtown Kisumu. Her husband works at a supermarket. She sells all kinds of fish, but primarily Tilapia from Lake Victoria. She is asking for a loan of 10,000 Kenyan Shillings so that she can buy a larger quantity of fish to sell. \r\n<P>\r\nShe also laid out the problems that many fish-sellers here in Kisumu have. If the weather is bad, customers won\u2019t come. If the fishermen have a bountiful catch, fish-stock floods the market and this drives the price down. Preserving the fish also can be very difficult for these women who have little or no access to electricity \u2013 so they sometimes will rent out space in someone\u2019s refrigerator. If the fish start to go bad, they will fry them and sell them dry. \r\n<P>\r\nWhen asked what else she would like Kiva lenders to know, Maureen replied that life is difficult right now in Kisumu and regular income is difficult to come by. She says it is hard to earn enough for all her children to go to school and that she says it is most likely she will not be able to afford to send any of her children to college, though she would like to. She says that she will be happy if she can get the money to send her children to college. \r\n<P>\r\nMaureen recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illness. Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":303848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She lives with her children and mother in a ger (a yurt or nomadic housing tent) district on the plot of land that she owns in Arhangay, one of the Mongolian central provinces. \r\n\r\nEnebish started a tailoring business in 2001. Then, in 2006, she started selling second-hand clothes at the local market. She purchases used clothing that is imported from South Korea. She pays 10,000 tugrugs (about $7) for a kilo of used clothes and then resells each item for a slightly higher price. Enebish says that \"many poor and vulnerable people live in our province and big portions of my buyers consist of them.

She is 52 years old. Rosario is married and has two school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Rosario runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of products in the local community. Rosario has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Rosario joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosario has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Rosario is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Rosario from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":449117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Ella solicita un pr\u00e9stamo a trav\u00e9s del cual pueda comprar mayor cantidad de productos, ya que desea poder vender m\u00e1s, as\u00ed mismo es de mucha importancia contar con el dinero necesario para hacer esto ultimo, ya que la mayor\u00eda de sus clientes compran su mercader\u00eda a cr\u00e9dito, por lo que en algunas ocasiones esto le dificulta seguir invirtiendo en el negocio. Gloria anhela en gran manera seguir super\u00e1ndose en su negocio alcanzando nuevas metas, las cuales beneficien en gran manera el presente y futuro de sus hijos.","en":"Gloria Guadalupe P. A. is a hardworking woman.  She is 37 years old and watches over her family\u2019s wellbeing.  She lives in the La Libertad department and lives with her husband and two children of 7 and 14 years of age.  Gloria sells beauty products of different brands that are very well-known in the country, some of the products that she sells are: facial cleanser creams, perfumes, body lotion and other items.  She sells them door to door since she offers them to her neighbors and friends; she has a lot of customers since Gloria visits them periodically to offer her products.  She needs a loan so that she can buy a greater quantity of products since she wants to be able to sell more and needs the money to buy them since the majority of her customers buy her merchandize on credit which sometimes makes it difficult for her to invest in the business.  Gloria wishes to be able to keep excelling on her job by reaching new goals that will benefit her in a great way as well as the present and future of her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Canonoy, Miranda, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by  fishing and fish-vending business.\n\nJorema\u2019s 47-year-old husband, Renaldo, is a fisherman and they have seven children who are between 4 to 27 years old. Two of their children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. The rest of their children already work to help support the family.\n\nJorema joined NWTF-Project Dungganon (NWTF-PD) in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her fishing and fish-vending business. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000 from her business activities.\n\nJorema is a member of good standing. She used her previous loan of Php 18,000 to add to her working capital so that she could sustainably expand the operations of her fishing and fish-vending business and it had a positive impact on both the business and on the family\u2019s living conditions. Based on previous experience, she anticipates her business turnover to slowdown a bit because of the rainy season, this is the reason why she is borrowing a smaller loan of  Php 10,000 for her 18th loan, the amount she has projected to be enough to continue sustaining her business operations.\n\nJorema is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband, Erwin L., who is 46 years old, is a Chief Security Officer, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 11 to  17 years old. \r\n\r\nMenchie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Menchie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 28,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is again borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of their children.

This is why she is so happy about getting credit from Kiva.  It will help her plan to gradually increase her capital and offer good prices, which she can get with cash and volume purchases, and thereby make this investment successful.

","en":"Tatyana is 39 years old, a widow and has three children.  In search of a source of income for her family, Tatyana started her animal husbandry in 2003.

Monica never got the chance to go to college because of a lack of fees, but this never killed the zeal that she had for succeeding, and she started farming on a small plot of farmland that she inherited from her parents. <br \/><br \/>Through hard work, she has managed to practice crop farming and animal farming, and has managed to take care of her parents and also take care of her basic needs. Monica grows vegetables and fruits and keeps dairy cows as a source of income. Although she has been making profits, she is challenged by timely delivery of products to the market. This has made her profits go down because goods reach the market when they are not fresh, and hence fetch lower prices. <br \/><br \/>Monica comes from an area that has poor feeder roads, and this has been a major problem for her. That is why she is seeking a loan of KES 55,000 to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, Monica will be able to transport her farm produce to the market and deliver it in a timely manner, and hence it will fetch higher prices. Vegetables, fruits, and milk are perishable products, and they require quick delivery to the market, so this motorbike will be of so much help. <br \/><br \/>Through timely delivery of her product, she is sure of increased profits, and this will translate to better living conditions and a secure future.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business is important because it provides income to cover all the family expenses.  She is proud of her business and of her work, which helped her cover the expenses of her older children's education, who have already achieved careers.  Her business is popular for the good prices of her products, and good service for her customers.  She uses her earnings for food, clothing, shoes, and general costs such as electricity, water and gas. \r\n\r\nHer hopes and dreams are to put a roof slab on her home and to finish it so her children can live more comfortably, and for her young daughter to continue studying, and later to have a profession. \r\n\r\nThe group members want to tell Kiva  and the Fundacion Realidad, \"Thank you for helping us.  We are grateful to you for providing these loans to us, and we hope you continue your valuable work and help people in need.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":819253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy toys, cosmetics, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, and costume jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tetela del Volcan, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvestra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atzidi Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":571.88,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6774.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201872},{"amount":476.56,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5645.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807464},{"amount":476.56,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5645.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618558}],"funded_date":"2011-08-15T22:51:28Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":327979,"name":"Leonard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonard is a 33 year old married man with two children.

","en":"Koisun is 45 years old, married and has four children, the youngest of whom is six years old.  Koisun works as a salesperson at a local store and also works part-time as an orderly at a hospital, earning about 5,000 som (KGS) per month.  In search of means of survival for her family, she started her own business of breeding livestock and reselling agricultural crops in 1996.  Koisun used an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS) to buy livestock and was able to grow her business to have a monthly profit of about 5,000 som (KGS) now.  In order to further develop her business, Koisun requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase heifers.  In the near future, she plans to increase livestock headcount with the help of the profit from this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":932886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T05:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koisun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":433.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20230.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975590},{"amount":433.34,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":20230.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095376},{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":20230.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329627}],"funded_date":"2011-12-13T12:19:48Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":368984,"name":"Girlie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Girlie is 51 years old and lives in the Philippines.
