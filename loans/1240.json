with his wife.  They live in a rented house with their four children and two of his wife\u2019s sisters. \r\n\r\nLaston likes to describe his business as the service of sending and receiving money from one location to another in Zambia.  He started operating the business as a way to provide for his family and empower his wife.  Laston enjoys the business because it is an opportunity for him to serve his community.  He enjoys interacting with all the customers from different walks of life that do business at his outlet.  \r\n\r\nThe reason for Laston\u2019s loan request is his big challenge of having very little working capital to service his customer base.   When customers want to send large amounts of money, he cannot serve them.  It also makes operations difficult because he is always running back and forth to the bank to maintain enough cash to serve customers.  This Kiva loan will enable Laston to more than double his working capital float and in turn, serve more customers.

Just last March, a group of women decided to organize themselves into a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank (which they named, Roca Fuerte Trust Bank) and they requested their first loan cycle from Friendship Bridge. Happily, the women were able to successfully pay back the entire loan. \r\n\r\nThe group is currently composed of 15 members, including six new members. The women are motivated to move forward and they have requested another loan cycle. They are engaged in various commercial activities, such as selling shoes, produce (vegetables, fruit, and tortillas), clothing, and snacks. Another client owns a sawmill. There is even a client who sells products by catalogue! Their ultimate goal is to support their families, send their children to school, and develop their community.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Trust Bank is 25-year-old Gabriela, who is the mother of two children. Gabriela and her husband own the sawmill, which they started about four years ago. With a great deal of time and effort, they were able to grow their business and they have been quite innovative. They have introduced new products to their customers, which have been helpful in expanding their business. Gabriela is eager to receive her second loan with Friendship Bridge, which she will use to purchase additional wood to make more products for the customers. There are four additional employees in their business!\r\n\r\nGabriela, along with all members of the Roca Fuerte Trust Bank, are happy to belong to the Friendship Bridge program and express their great appreciation to Kiva investors. The women meet once a month to make payments and receive training on topics, such as children's rights (with an emphasis on education), women's health, hygiene, nutrition, business administration, savings and indebtedness. These trainings benefit not only the members, but also their families and the community. They look forward to a brighter future as empowered women, eliminating poverty!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5875,"image":{"id":1441502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional wood to make furniture.

Guatemala. The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Golondrinas\u201d or \u201cThe Swallows\u201d is located here and is composed of six women who are mostly in their twenties except for one who is 60 years of age. The group is starting its third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. These loans will be most useful in providing working capital for the various businesses of these women including textile production and animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nThe President of \u201cLas Golondrinas\u201d is 25-year-old Ana who has a dynamic personality and a tremendous drive to move forward. She is married with an 8-month-old baby boy. Ana makes handmade traditional textiles, especially the beautiful sashes called \u201cfajas\u201d used by the indigenous women of Guatemala to keep their tubular skirts in place. She also raises animals including chickens, pigs and rabbits. Ana travels by public transport to three different markets outside her community each week to sell her products. She is happy to begin her 3rd loan cycle with Friendship Bridge as it allows her to increase her inventory and increase her income. She will buy raw materials such as yarn and thread as well as some animals and feed for them.\r\n\r\nAna relates that she really enjoys belonging to the Trust Bank and being with many of the women of her community on a monthly basis. During their meetings, which last for about one hour, the women receive training about various topics such as health, nutrition, self-esteem and women\u2019s rights. Ana states that the topic that impacts her the most is business management. In her own words, \u201cI like to go the meetings because I have fun with my colleagues and we share and learn a lot together.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe six women of the \u201cLas Golondrinas\u201d Trust Bank thank KIVA investors for their generosity and confidence in funding their loan. With these funds, the ladies can sustain and grow their businesses, generate an income and support their families. They are especially pleased that they can provide for their children\u2019s educational needs. Armed with their new tools, everyone looks forward to a brighter future for themselves, their families and their town, Santa Lucia La Reforma.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1441549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase raw materials such as yarn and thread, and to buy animals ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Lucia La Reforma, Totonicapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Everilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":21300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2338.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855095},{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503431},{"amount":300.44,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728415},{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449634437},{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459100932},{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467915927},{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479136735},{"amount":300.44,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490830625},{"amount":296.42,"local_amount":2338.4,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256570}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T20:04:55Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T12:29:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":614367,"name":"Oretha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oretha is 35 years old and lives in Buchanan.

She is the head of the household since she separated from her husband.  She currently tends to her business, a bakery that she started in order to generate income on her own.  She did this because she saw the need to take care of her children.  \r\n\r\nA brother-in-law taught her everything having to do with making the products.  This is because she did not have any knowledge about this subject.  She was learning little by little.  This way she was able to get her business ahead.  She managed to be known in the neighborhood where she is located.  In addition to selling bakery products, she also sells pastries and dairy products.  This generates the income she needs to pay for the household\u2019s basic necessities.  \r\n\r\nShe wishes to invest in the purchase of fixed assets (cooling case and fan) and wholesale stock (pastries and dairy products).

She is now 55 years of age, and married with three children.

Durante este tiempo pude mantenerme entre los primeros diez promedios acad\u00e9micos de la carrera. Mis responsabilidades financieras y materiales incluyen la manutenci\u00f3n m\u00eda y de mi se\u00f1ora madre, el pago de un cr\u00e9dito educativo al ICETEX y de otras obligaciones con bancos. \n\nSoy un apasionado por la Historia y por un \u00e1rea de estudio espec\u00edfica: Rusia y Europa centro-oriental.

He worked as the editor of a small online publication on industrial engineering to pay for his college history program. He lives with and financially supports his mother, who is a homemaker. Rodolfo dreams of obtaining a masters in Russian and Central-eastern European studies. The only way he can pay for the language test and the university application to enter the program is to apply for a Kiva loan. \r\n\r\nRodolfo tells his story:\r\n\r\n\"I worked hard to finish my undergraduate program, working and studying at the same time. I was able to support myself during the first ten academic semesters of the program. I was financially and materially responsible for both myself and my mother, my student loan at ICETEX, and other bank loans. I love history, specifically Russian and central-eastern European history. I strongly believe that a country's advancement and progress should include preparing experts not only in fields that generate material wealth\u2014engineering, advanced technology, economics, finance, and others\u2014 but also fields like humanities that promote the intellectual and cultural riches and knowledge of our society as well as others. A solid foundation like the one I hope to achieve and spreading what I learned throughout Colombia could help me contribute to this proposition. I'm certain that I will be studying for my masters in Europe in 2014.  \r\n\r\nKiva is providing a great opportunity to achieve my goal, especially since I don't have much money and lately my job has not been stable. This has made my financial situation and my income uncertain. So I hope you will lend me your support. After I finish the masters and return to Colombia, I hope to work in academia and research so that I can share and spread the knowledge I acquired and create friendships in both countries.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1443498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay application fees for the masters program in Russian and Central European studies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogota D.C.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":171.15,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2070000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.96,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-11T10:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":200600.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.32,"payment_id":595140356},{"amount":102.72,"local_amount":222000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-11T10:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":222666.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.25,"payment_id":610534945},{"amount":110.82,"local_amount":268000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":268804.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":31.6,"payment_id":624206378},{"amount":101.46,"local_amount":235000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":235705.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.42,"payment_id":636192539},{"amount":522.89,"local_amount":1145000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1148438.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":85.56,"payment_id":650529939}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T13:53:22Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":614471,"name":"Kunthea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kunthea (in the photo) is a weaver, and lives on an island of the Mekong River about 15 kilometers from Phnom Penh. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a musician.

His net income is too low to meet the family's needs. Presently, the stock of his shop is depleted and he needs additional capital to purchase a variety of goods to sell. \r\n\r\nTherefore, to help her husband, Parveen, as a member of a three-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva partner, BRAC Pakistan.

With the profits expected from this loan, he intends to expand his business, so that he can eventually construct a small house for his family. \r\n\r\nParveen hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

She lives in Pakistan with her husband, three sons, and two daughters. Her husband's income is insufficient to meet the family's needs, so Ulfat is trying to help him fill their needs by stitching clothing. \r\n\r\nSince 2010 Ulfat has operated her tailoring business very efficiently, but she is currently in need of purchasing a new sewing machine, as her old machine is not working properly. To do that, she has requested a loan as a member of an eight-person group from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan so she can continue her business. With the profits she will pay the household expenses, put aside some savings, pay utility bills and open a new mobile shop for her elder son. She is hopeful that the loan will be a productive one for them.

The women are originally from Sauce, in the west of the country.  The members are hard-working, responsible, and have a desire to overcome all obstacles.  Unfortunately they were not able to study at university and were obliged to work from a young age, in order to help with household costs.\r\n\r\nThanks to her spirit and her desire to get ahead, Alba, the communal bank's co\u00f6rdinator, has a grocery store that she runs out of her home.  The grocery store sells consumable products, such as rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, juices, oil, and matches, in small quantities.  Alba works selling her products some twelve hours every day.  This loan will be used to invest in working capital and to stock up her business. With this, in the not-too-distant future, Alba will be able to earn a higher income.  The \"El Milagro\" communal bank is grateful to Kiva lenders for providing people with little resources and poor countries, such as Nicaragua, with the opportunity to have a decent job.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1157013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

However, above all, she wants to give her family a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1447212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy oil, meat, vegetables, tables, and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T22:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T22:20:22Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":40.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":46.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":56.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":61.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.58,"local_amount":83.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429605219},{"amount":43.29,"local_amount":43.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440065107},{"amount":44.81,"local_amount":44.81,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":44.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449720543},{"amount":47.87,"local_amount":47.87,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":47.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459199318},{"amount":50.74,"local_amount":50.74,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468018807},{"amount":49.46,"local_amount":49.46,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T09:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":49.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479241999},{"amount":55.12,"local_amount":55.12,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T17:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":55.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490938052},{"amount":225.13,"local_amount":225.13,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T16:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":225.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504375796}],"funded_date":"2013-11-04T02:36:54Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T16:52:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":614576,"name":"Savoern's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Savoern, 33 years old, is married, with three children, residing in a rural village located in the Battambang province\u2019s Moung Russey district, Cambodia.

G\u00ebzim works as waiter in a pizzeria restaurant. \r\n\r\nA few years ago, his family started to build an annex on their house because it was so small. Although they were able to complete the construction, they were not able to get the electricity installed because the money G\u00ebzim generates through his work is not enough. \r\n\r\nFor this reason G\u00ebzim is requesting a loan to pay for the installation of electricity and finally complete the renovation of his house. He  hopes that the loan will improve his family's standard of living and make life easier for him and his family. \r\n\r\nHe is very appreciative of this help and promises to make his payments punctually."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1436203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To install the electricity in his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"XK","country":"Kosovo","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42.583333 21","type":"point"}},"partner_id":240,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"G\u00ebzim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"EUR","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":73},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":74},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":82},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":86},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":94},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":99},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":107}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":614620,"name":"Remzije","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remzije is the mother of five children between the ages of 5 and 12 years old.

She is married and has two children, ages 11 and 14. Two of her sisters live with her to get assistance with their schooling. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Adama established her cosmetics and provisions business. She began her business at the age of 20 when she became pregnant.  Her parents told her to go to the man who impregnated her, and in the end, the man decided to give her substantive capital to establish her own business so that she could get help for some domestic issues.

They have two children who attend public school, a girl, age 8 and a boy, age 6. They have lived in the Ecuadorian city of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas since they were very young. The city is a commercial center and is often referred to as the \u201cport of opportunity\u201d because it connects the mountains with the coast, and has a warm, humid climate. \r\n\r\nCesar started working as a master mason at a very young age, in order to support his family. Little by little, his work allowed him to build his own small home in a low-income area of the city. Cesar\u2019s wife, Monica, is a homemaker and she takes care of their children. Cesar says that he wants to improve his quality of life. A while ago he started his own business raising chickens because he had experience from helping his sister with her chicken coops. \r\n\r\nCesar is requesting this loan from Kiva and the field partner to buy chickens, balanced feed and materials to build a coop on the land where he lives. He says that building there will allow his wife to help him to improve their household finances, too. Cesar also hopes to be able to buy a motorcycle so that he can distribute his products to stores and restaurants in the canton.\r\n\r\nCesar says that other lending institutions closed their doors to him, but he found out that Kiva and the field partner could make his dream a reality, and he feels very grateful for the help he receives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1447247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy chickens, balanced feed and materials to build chicken coops.

Robby lives with his wife and two children in the capital city of Zambia, Lusaka. His Zoona mobile money business is the only source of income for the family.  \r\n\r\nRobby is requesting a third loan from Kiva.  His first loan was received in October of 2012. The money was used to increase his working capital at his shop, which enabled him to serve more customers and increase his income. With the additional revenue, Robby invested into opening up a second Zoona outlet in the small district of Serenje, located in the central province of Zambia. In May of 2013, Robby took out a second loan with Kiva. This money was used as working capital float for a new shop location in Lilanda compound. This is a highly populated township located in Lusaka. With the help from the two previous Kiva loans, Robby now successfully operates three shops.  \r\n\r\nNow, Robby is requesting a loan to increase his working capital at all three business locations. This will enable him to serve more customers and earn additional income. Robby explains that finding access to loans in Zambia as a micro-entrepreneur is difficult.

The increased income will be used for his family's

She has been in this line of work for 10 years now, and she is proud to be contributing to her household income. When Irshad was not earning, her family was going through a severe financial crisis that compelled her to use her stitching skills in a productive manner.

For that purpose, Rozina is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of carpets to sell. This will help him to offer more variety to his customers and to respond quickly to customer needs. With the help of the profit amount he will put aside some savings amount to pay for the electricity and gas bill. Rozina hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business. She is thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1443310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

Tresfold and Clement used to work for a bus service together. They each diligently saved money from their salaries, and eventually were able to open a Zoona shop at the bus terminal. Currently, their business is their only source of income and they make all the transactions themselves.

They describe their business as the easiest way for people in Zambia to transfer money safely.\r\n\r\nTresfold and Clement have requested a Kiva loan to increase their working capital to serve more customers sending and receiving money at their shop and grow their business.  This is the first time they are requesting a Kiva loan. As young micro-entrepreneurs in Zambia, working capital is very difficult to find. Tresfold and Clement appreciate the opportunity to be linked to Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nTresfold and Clement have large aspirations for their business.  One day, they plan to become the largest Zoona mobile money transfer agents in the capital city of Lusaka. They believe their loan is the next step in helping them achieve this goal.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4775,"image":{"id":1407111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To increase their working capital to serve more customers sending and receiving money at their shop and grow their business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T12:10:03Z","loan_amount":4775,"lender_count":177,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":416.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clement","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tresfold","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":4775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":312.6,"local_amount":1636.65,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T16:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1641.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439893476},{"amount":44.08,"local_amount":230.78,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-18T10:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":231.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449781124},{"amount":298.61,"local_amount":1632.32,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1636.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.16,"payment_id":459261905},{"amount":269.47,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T18:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.03,"payment_id":468086437},{"amount":301.65,"local_amount":1799.5,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T22:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1804.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":42.05,"payment_id":479303821},{"amount":317.8,"local_amount":1803.6,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T21:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1808.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.69,"payment_id":491000277},{"amount":346.85,"local_amount":1927.58,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1932.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.32,"payment_id":504442338},{"amount":328.66,"local_amount":1835.44,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1840.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.91,"payment_id":517719041},{"amount":368.49,"local_amount":2073.47,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2079.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.54,"payment_id":531340944},{"amount":386.41,"local_amount":2228.03,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T11:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2234.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":39.14,"payment_id":562560112},{"amount":297.44,"local_amount":1709.61,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.1,"payment_id":579833146},{"amount":551.58,"local_amount":3282.91,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3291.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":75.46,"payment_id":595362707},{"amount":373.41,"local_amount":2264.75,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2270.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":59.16,"payment_id":610750936},{"amount":161.71,"local_amount":1075.36,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1078.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":43.68,"payment_id":624435645}],"funded_date":"2013-11-07T07:48:27Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T14:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":608021,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary lives in the Kisii area of Kenya, which is a primary bananas and sugar cane growing region.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Most of my family members are carvers, for it is a family legacy that has endured several generations. You could say I was born with a talent to carve, which I developed by merely observing my parents and relatives at work every day. My inspiration comes from Balinese customs and traditions. Competition is hard here in Bali, for there are many expert carvers, making the life of a carver a very uncertain one. It means that I must excel, so hopefully my sculptures will be welcomed. \r\n\r\n\"I work on my own, so the amount of products I can carve is limited and so are my sales. This microcredit will make it easier for me to buy larger amounts of wood and increase my stock. Every piece I carve with my own hands is done with love and happy thoughts.

They need to buy fertilizer in order to increase their production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing, as well as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf.  All borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing, as well as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1443406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy more fertilizers for use during maize production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soline\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":840314,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":840314}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1275,"local_amount":840314,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":854826.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279824}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T04:53:42Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T21:21:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":614817,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is 50 years old and she is very responsible with her household obligations since she has always been known to provide the best for her family.

This will mean that she is able to finish paying the fees on her own home, and so enjoy a better quality of life and well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1447771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more stock for her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":71384},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":73362},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75395},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":77484},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":79631},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":81837},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":86436},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":88831},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":91292},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":93822},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":96421}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.26,"local_amount":71394,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":74087.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095661},{"amount":40.35,"local_amount":73362,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":76130.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074709},{"amount":41.47,"local_amount":75423,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":78268.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009905},{"amount":86.41,"local_amount":157077,"processed_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":163003.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523518},{"amount":342.51,"local_amount":622744,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":646241.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227230}],"funded_date":"2013-10-14T18:35:17Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":614760,"name":"Susanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susanna is an experienced agronomist from the village Achajour in the Tavush region.

The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1443412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy more fertilizers during maize production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Esperance\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":867421,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":867421}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":867421,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:21:07Z","rounded_local_amount":871588.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279825}],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:52Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T21:21:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":614762,"name":"Seryozha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seryozha is from Agarak city in the Syuniq region.
