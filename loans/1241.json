and dependent on her. She lives in a local area of Battambang province\u2019s Moung Russey district and she is 61 years old. To make a living, she manages four hectares of farmland to do rice farming as a main source of her family\u2019s income. She has been involved in this current business for 30 years and the main challenge of her business is lack of capital to buy fertilizer for her farmland. This is the seventh cycle loan for Chhoeurm and she has completely repaid back her previous loans. The past loans have improved her business gradually.

He visits his mother every day.\r\n\r\nMagola makes a living selling fruit in the market in Sigchos, an area away from the city.

She goes to market on Monday and Sunday; the rest of the week she stays at home taking care of small animals such as chickens, guinea pigs, and pigs.\r\n\r\nShe has to go out and work because of her financial situation, as she doesn't have the support of her son's father.  She worked in the field with her parents from a very young age.  Now Magola takes care of her mother because her father died.\r\n\r\nMagola's requesting the loan to invest in fruits and vegetables because her customers have asked for variety.  She has a lot of demand because this is a commercial area.  It's difficult for her right now to transport her products, which is why she can't go more often to sell her products.  With the income from her small animals, though, she has been able to get ahead and pay for her own necessities and those of her mother, who's a senior citizen.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to be

She is described as a fighter who has an entrepreneurial spirit and a strong desire to better herself and get ahead. Rosa Lilian has five children, all of whom help her with the jobs to maintain their coffee crop such as weeding, pruning, fertilizing and applying manure. She finished the third grade, but was unable to stay in school because her parents did not have enough money. Rosa Lilian\u2019s parents taught her how to work the land at a very young age, and she has worked growing coffee since childhood. Her family continues growing coffee today, and she says that it is their only source of income. Rosa Lilian says that they own the fields where they grow their coffee, thanks to their sacrifices and hard work. Their fields are a 20-minute walk from their home. \r\n\r\nRosa Lilian is requesting this loan to buy fertilizers, manure, leaf fertilizer and other supplies to maintain her coffee crop. She hopes to have a healthy and profitable harvest so that she can make a good income and continue to invest in her coffee crop. Her goal is to plant more coffee so that she can improve her family\u2019s income and, little by little, increase the size of her harvest. Rosa Lilian says that her profits will help to ensure her children\u2019s future and will allow her to give them an education and continue to invest in her crop. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1447881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizers, manure, leaf fertilizer and other supplies to maintain her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T21:40:07Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2.2,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":44.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833776},{"amount":622.8,"local_amount":12456.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12743.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042241}],"funded_date":"2013-10-11T00:39:20Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":614948,"name":"Sarorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Originally from Battambang province, Sarorn is 48 years old and a widowed mother of four children.

Nuriya has a secondary education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 13 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nuriya's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 2 calves, 10 sheep and 2 goats. The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Nuriya requested a loan in the amount of 105,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows in order to increase livestock headcount. Nuriya plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to purchase a car for her son.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1446885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows in order to increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13125},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13125},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13125},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13125},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13125},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13125},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13125},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":614957,"name":"Gulzar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulzar is 56 years old, married and a mother of three children.

raising 3 children together with her husband.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and works as an assistant at a local preschool; she also raises livestock on the side, having started 19 years ago with 1,000 somoni worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, her farm currently has 4 dairy cows and 10 sheep, while her monthly income is nearly 5,000 somoni.  To further develop her farm, Orozkul is seeking a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners; she hopes to borrow 20,000 somoni to buy more sheep for her farm, and plans to use her increased income due to the loan to buy even more livestock, as well as to save money for her son's wedding reception.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1446908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kurmanjan Datka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-08T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-07T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orozkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1447},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1483},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1521},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1560},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1599},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1640},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1682},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1725},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1768},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1813},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1859},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1903}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.26,"local_amount":2930,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3044.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427107},{"amount":65.47,"local_amount":3081,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3201.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553155},{"amount":33.53,"local_amount":1599,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1661.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":459019619},{"amount":34.43,"local_amount":1640,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1703.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":467830952},{"amount":35.75,"local_amount":1682,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1747.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749515},{"amount":74.23,"local_amount":3493,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3629.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178243},{"amount":77.8,"local_amount":3672,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3815.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.23,"payment_id":529946885},{"amount":39.67,"local_amount":1903,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1977.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.76,"payment_id":542440237}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T14:14:06Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":614907,"name":"Firdos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Firdos is a 45-year-old married woman living in the Lahore region of Pakistan.

She starts working from 4:00 a.m. and works to 7:00 p.m. per working day and is able to make an excellent profit. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fifth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. Kwirabi used her previous loans to buy more freshwater fish and bought a business freezer for her fish.

He would like to stock up on wool and dyes for his creations. <p>\r\n\r\nDavid has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. This is his story: his grandparents and parents were weavers, who learned this trade from their predecessors. He essentially learned through observation. Nevertheless, he has taken several textile courses. His work focuses on resuscitating his ancestral culture and linking it to the present. He works with his family, and their materials include wool, cotton, and both natural and industrial dyes.

He was a jeweler and worked at his craft day and night. I was curious about it but didn't really give it much attention. As an adult, I'd go to the mountains to trade scales for grams of gold.  And this is how I became enthused about jewelry.  One day, I stayed watching my father and he suggested I pay close attention to what he was doing. In this way, I began to learn each detail of every piece.  I never attended workshops or courses, as my father was my teacher, although he never gave me a formal class. I learned myself by observing, and never let a single detail get past me.  These days I get up at night to sit and design quietly.\"\n\nA message from Carlos: \"First of all, please receive a big hug for your support through this microcredit. It warms the heart to know there are people out there who are willing to help without expecting anything in return. And you have my word that every piece of jewelry I make will be crafted with high quality materials and loads of love!\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1437983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in a bulk purchase of silver and natural gemstones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23.88,"local_amount":23.88,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":23.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602154},{"amount":75.43,"local_amount":75.43,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-23T09:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":75.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829202},{"amount":88.2,"local_amount":88.2,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":88.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449718843},{"amount":35.25,"local_amount":35.25,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":35.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459197614},{"amount":88.62,"local_amount":88.62,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468016958},{"amount":388.62,"local_amount":388.62,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T17:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":388.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240262}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T17:58:43Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T17:02:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mark McDermott","image":1404670}},{"id":615072,"name":"Timina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Timina lives on a farm outside of Kakamega town, in Kakamega county.

todos son muy buenos amigos y entre ellos existe un apoyo incondicional. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron ellos mismos porque es un nombre b\u00edblico, as\u00ed se llam\u00f3 el lugar donde Ad\u00e1n y Eva viv\u00edan.\n\nDo\u00f1a Adoraci\u00f3n o Dora, como le dicen de cari\u00f1o, es la representante del grupo, tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Armando; juntos han formado una familia con una hija que se encuentra estudiando. Do\u00f1a Dora se dedica a la cr\u00eda y venta de cerdos desde hace ya seis a\u00f1os platica como fue que inicio su negocio \u201cLa cr\u00eda de los cerdos la inicie por necesidad, tambi\u00e9n por la falta de un trabajo estable, las saudas o las estructuras para iniciar con la cr\u00eda de mis cerdos ya estaban porque eran de mis padres\". Los padres de Dora tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a esta actividad. Do\u00f1a Dora solo cr\u00eda y engorda sus lechoncitos para despu\u00e9s venderlos mientras que a unas cuantas cerdas las utiliza solo para pie cr\u00eda cuando estas dan sus  a luz a sus cerditos de inmediato inicia  a buscar su comprador en muchas ocasiones es muy dif\u00edcil encontrar personas que desean adquirir un lechoncito. Do\u00f1a Dora adem\u00e1s de estar ofreciendo sus lechones con sus vecinos tambi\u00e9n coloca un letrero afuera de su casa con la leyenda \u201cSe venden lechones\u201d. Esta situaci\u00f3n es la dificultad de Dora, es decir, poder encontrar un buen comprador. Ella tiene una amplia experiencia en cerdos porque desde muy chica se vio involucrada en esta actividad. Sus cerdas solo pueden llegar a tener seis o siete lechoncitos en cada camada. Al momento de quedar cargada la cerda se esperan cuatro meses es un periodo de gestaci\u00f3n, los lechones nacen y por cuarenta d\u00edas Do\u00f1a Dora tiene que tener un cuidado especial con ellos, pasando este tiempo ya puede venderlos. Aunque de ante mano sabe cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 la dificultadad para vender sus lechones, ella est\u00e1 muy motivada a seguir con su actividad \u201cNo hay de otra m\u00e1s que seguir ech\u00e1ndole ganas, me gustar\u00eda hacer crecer mi negocio tengo las estructuras necesarias para tener los suficientes lechones pero en la comunidad hay muchos vecinos dedicados a la cr\u00eda y venta de cerdos as\u00ed no puedo vender ya con mucha facilidad\u201d. Sin embargo la meta de Do\u00f1a Dora es ver realizado el sue\u00f1o de su hija que quiere llegar a ser  un medico cirujano. Esta profesi\u00f3n le naci\u00f3 desde peque\u00f1a porque siempre sus abuelos eran muy enfermizos, siempre deseo poder ayudar a mejorar su condici\u00f3n. Los miembros del grupo son Wilebaldo quien invertir\u00e1 en la venta de jarciar\u00eda; \u00c1lvaro, en la cr\u00eda, engorda y venta de pollos y guajolotes; Jos\u00e9, en la venta de fibras y Rosario, en la cr\u00eda y engorda de cerdos. Ellos est\u00e1n muy agradecidos por la oportunidad de recibir un pr\u00e9stamo fondeado por personas de diferentes partes del mundo, adem\u00e1s porque llevan ya dos a\u00f1os en VFM y ya han visto las mejor\u00eda en sus actividades.","en":"The group \u201cEden\u201d is composed of five people, both men and women. All of them are very good friends and unconditional support exists among them. They chose their name themselves from the biblical name, calling it after the place where Adam and Eve lived.\n\nAdoraci\u00f3n, or Dora as she is affectionately called, is the representative of the group. She is 40 years old and married to Armando. They have a daughter who is studying. Dora has been raising and selling pigs for six years saying about starting her business, \u201cBreeding pigs was a necessity because of the lack of stable work and the inclination and framework were already there from my parents to begin raising pigs.\u201d Dora\u2019s parents also work in this field. Dora breeds and fattens some of her piglets to sell later while some of the other pigs are only used for breeding and she starts looking for buyers right away as many times it is hard to find people wanting to buy a piglet.\n\nDora also offers her piglets through her neighbors placing a sign outside their house reading, \u201cPiglets for sale\u201d. This situation is difficult for Dora, that is to say, finding a good buyer. She has extensive experience in pigs because since she was a young girl she has been involved in this business. \n\nHer pigs can only have six or seven piglets in each litter. From the moment of conception they have a four month period of gestation, then the piglets are born and for forty days Dora has to be especially careful with them, waiting for the time when she can sell them. Although she knows before hand that it will be difficult to sell her piglets, she is very motivated to continue working in this field. \u201cThere is no other option than to continue going forward. I would like to grow my business. I have the necessary structures in place to have enough piglets but in the community there are many neighbors growing and selling pigs so I can\u2019t sell them easily.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dora\u2019s goal is to see her daughter become a surgeon. This professional desire has been there since childhood because her grandparents were always ailing, and she always wanted to help them get better.\n\nThe members of the group are Wilebaldo who will invest by selling rigging ropes; \u00c1lvaro who raises, fattens and sells chickens and turkeys; Jos\u00e9 sells fibers, and Rosario raises and fattens pigs. They are very grateful for the opportunity of receiving a loan funded by people from different parts of the world, and because they have been with VisionFund Mexico for two years they have already seen their activities improve.

She would like to invest in the purchase of more silver, jade and tools so she can develop her new designs.\n\nZandra has been selling through NOVICA since 2011. This is her story:\n\n\"The first thing I ever made on my own was a pair of silver earrings. My husband taught me so I could help him. I remember watching him work on his own 'til all hours of the night and I really wanted to learn how to craft jewelry. Finally the day came when he asked me to help him and that's how I started. As I saw the jewelry I had been crafting and saw how beautiful it was. It's not been easy getting established as an artisan because silver is very expensive and it's difficult to purchase. But when you set your own mind to it, you can achieve your goals. My greatest dream is to be able to buy a piece of land and build my own house so that I may leave it to my two sons.\n\nI like to work with jade because it is a sacred stone for us Maya people. Jade used to be worn as an amulet, and those who wore the most jade pieces were considered to be the most important people in the community. Rescuing the value of our traditions is always important.\n\nSilver has become a way of life for my family, and little by little I'm teaching my sons so that when they grow up they may choose to continue what their mom and dad began for them. Guatemala offers many opportunities for those of us who like to work hard and now my husband and I have a workshop where we also sell our designs. I strongly believe that everything is possible if one has dreams, and that nothing is impossible if you work hard to achieve your goals.\"\n\nA message from Zandra: \"I have many new ideas in mind for new jewelry pieces, but I need some special tools to be able to make them. I would also like to prepare a good stock in time for the holiday season. That's why I would like to thank you so much for your support through this microcredit. May Good bless you.\"\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1251149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in the purchase of more silver, jade and tools so she can develop her new designs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Antigua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2550,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":233.34,"local_amount":233.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602164},{"amount":294,"local_amount":294,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T10:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":294,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829212},{"amount":206.01,"local_amount":206.01,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":206.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449718853},{"amount":291.61,"local_amount":291.61,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":291.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459197624},{"amount":242.67,"local_amount":242.67,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":242.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468016968},{"amount":342.64,"local_amount":342.64,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T17:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":342.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240296},{"amount":294,"local_amount":294,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T17:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":294,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490936645},{"amount":294,"local_amount":294,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T16:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":294,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504374420},{"amount":294,"local_amount":294,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T15:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":294,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517651938},{"amount":57.73,"local_amount":57.73,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T15:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":57.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530130952}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T16:45:54Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T15:43:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":8,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":615085,"name":"Leutrim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leutrim is 22 years old and a happily married father of a 1-year-old son, living in the southern part of Kosovo.

Ainagul has a secondary education.  Beginning 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 3000 KGS, Ainagul has been engaged in animal husbandry, which is the main source of income for her family.

She also has her own farm.  Batima has a secondary-specialized education, and works as an accountant in a local hospital.  Beginning 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5000 KGS, Batima's engagement in animal husbandry has been the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to the hard work of Batima, she now has: 1 milk cow, 1 calf, and 7 sheep.  Her monthly earnings are 10,000 KGS.  With the goal of further developing her herd, Batima turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 40,000 KGS in order to purchase cows for breeding.  With the earnings from her loan Batima plans to continue to increase her numbers of cattle and also plans to save funds to repair her

old, widowed, and, after the death of her husband, is raising 5 children herself.  She also runs her own farm.  Nazira has a secondary education.  Beginning 30 years ago, with the purchase of cattle for 400 KGS, Nazira's involvement in animal husbandry has served as the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to the hard work of Nazira, she currently cares for: 1 milk cow, 1 calf, and 32 sheep.  Her monthly income is 7000 KGS.  With the goal of further developing her farm, Nazira turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 40,000 KGS to purchase a calf for breeding.  With the earnings from her loan Nazira plans to continue to increase the size of her herd and also plans to save funds in order to repair her house.

Asimjan has a secondary education.  Beginning 40 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 100 KGS, Asimjan's engagement in animal husbandry has served as the primary source of income for her family.  Thanks to the hard work of Asimjan, she currently has in her care: 1 milk cow, 1 stallion, and 1 mare.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.  With the goal of further developing her farm, Asimjan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 40,000 KGS to purchase sheep for breeding.

Peter works as a carpenter, while his wife is a businesswoman. When he and his wife are not working, they farm their land. They are currently growing sugarcane, maize, and vegetables on their plot.

According to Temur\u2019s estimation, sales will be high as the location where he plans to hire the commercial space is crowded with people.\r\n\r\nThe income from the caf\u00e9 will be a great support for the family, as the children need much and Temur is not able to give them what they need with his current modest earnings.\r\n\r\nTemur appreciates your kindness. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1443998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start up a food cafe.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Rustavi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Temur ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":105.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":106.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":110.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":111.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":114.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":120.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":123.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":128.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":134.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":143.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":146.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.04},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":615089,"name":"Angello","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angello decided to supplement his construction business with repairing bicycles because this type of business does not require a big investment of capital.

He is married with six children.  In order to meet the financial needs of his family, and ensure the best standard of living for them, he operates as a trader, alongside his job.  He started to do this 4 years ago using his own funds to begin with.  He sells anything that will make a profit at that time.  \r\n\r\nAt this time of year, the children return to school so he is requesting this second loan to buy school supplies to resell in the school where he works.  Cheikh Ahmed has a regular customer base amongst the local people who know him well, thanks to his business.  \r\n\r\nHe is responsible for the day-to-day expenses of his household, and, thanks to this loan, he will be able to increase the amount he can afford to spend.  His ambition is to own a large chicken coop and develop his business thanks to loans from

Both he and his wife run businesses, as well as farming their land. They have been farming for 17 years and are currently growing sugarcane, vegetables, maize and rearing a cow. \r\n\r\nThis is Hesbon\u2019s first loan with Kiva, and he plans to use the income from his hives to expand his business.

","en":"A'zamkhon is 40 years old and from the Hamadoni region. He is a father to two sons and one daughter. A'zamkhon has a degree in pedagogy and has been working for 10 years in a school as a teacher. His wife doesn't work and takes care of the home. As do all his neighbours, A'zamkhon keeps cattle for his family's personal needs. Now he is requesting a loan to buy a pair of steers and run a business fattening and selling big-horned cattle. The amount he is borrowing to start his business is small, since some breeds of cows and steers cost a lot. A'zamkhon has decided not to take a chance with such a large sum. First he wants to acquire the necessary experience in the business and then he plans to expand it.

Yet it is still one of the poorest countries in Africa, with an average household income of just $1.45 per day. Nearly 80% of Rwanda\u2019s population lives in its mountainous rural terrain. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves estimates that over 8.5 million people in Rwanda are affected by household air pollution caused by cooking over open fires.  \n\nThe Paradigm Project has long been passionate about working in Rwanda to help alleviate the burden on household finances and health that is caused by cooking over open fires. We launched our EzyLife brand in Rwanda in 2012 in anticipation of finding a great business partner whom we could work with to build a local EzyLife business. \n\nWe first met Amri, who founded SERVE and SMILE to help bring life-improving products to the people of Rwanda, when he joined our campaign to pilot a market-based system for delivering cookstoves and solar lights to rural Rwanda. After nearly a year of working together, we are delighted to help Amri launch his own business in Rwanda with a Kiva loan that will purchase 2,880 cookstoves.\n\n\u201cThis loan will make our company dream comes true by stepping to the bottom of the pyramid as we are solving problems of the poor at the same time creating jobs in rural areas, mostly to women entrepreneurs (village agents),\u201d said Amri when he heard about the Kiva loan opportunity. \n\nAmri will launch his business in partnership with two unique groups: he will work with CARE, an international non-profit organization that is working with EzyLife to train 100 women entrepreneurs in rural areas who will do direct sales of Amri\u2019s cookstoves. He will also work with a vast network of community groups supporting survivors of the genocide, also helping to recruit and train women as cookstove entrepreneurs and sales agents. Through these two groups, there is already vast demand for the product \u2013 Amri is worried about having enough stoves to serve everyone in need! With this Kiva loan, he will be able to purchase enough stoves to satisfy the growing demand and sell them at a profit so that he can continue to grow his business in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":18725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":18725,"image":{"id":1445819,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2888,"youtubeId":"qoFc5aN2j0w","title":"Kiva Borrower

As the living conditions of the family are very poor, Nadia decided to apply for the credit and start a business trading clothes among her community members. There are not many clothing stores in her district and people can\u2019t afford to buy apparel due to high prices.

She has been stitching clothes for many years. She stitches for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. However, due to lack of availability of funds, she is unable to meet the daily demands of her customers. For this reason, she requested a loan of PKR 25,000 from the Kashf Foundation.

There is a  high demand for those fruits in the market.

in the small Cocales neighborhood of Nahualate, in the municipality of San Antonio, Suchitep\u00e9quez, Guatemala.  They gave this name to their group because they hope that with their hard work and the support of Namaste money management classes and the Namaste Business Advisor they will meet their business objectives, increase their incomes, and improve their lives.  These women are all very poor, have very little education and live in very simple houses, some with dirt floors.  They have a variety of businesses such as local clothing sales, corn and corn meal sales, chicken meat sales, meal preparation and a very small store.\n\nDo\u00f1a Tiburcia (1st from left) is a 58-year-old widow with a third-grade education, and 11 children, all grown up.  Her husband was killed 11 years ago in a robbery.  At that time she did not work, but she had to earn money.  She started working in a nursery, saving a little money so that she could someday start her own business.  After a few years she was able to start selling snacks and then started a small store in front of a public school.  Her goal is to increase her inventory of the items that the mothers and children at the school want to buy.\n\nTiburcia has been invited by the local public school to talk on Mother\u2019s Day to tell her story.  On these occasions, she talks about her life to show other women that when you have a dream and you work hard, there is nothing that can stop you.  Her children (two of whom live with her and help her) are very proud of her.\n Her current profit is about US $245 working 125 hours per month.  Her objective during this nine-month Namaste cycle is to improve her profit by 27% to about US $312.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1447248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

He works on his own every day from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm. He learned the trade by helping a relative who had a similar business. There he learned everything about managing this type of business. The store is in a very good location, an area where there is a lot of customer traffic flow, and it has a very good reputation and is very well stocked. \r\n\r\nThis client is known for being a very well organized man, hardworking and active. His spirit and drive for self improvement motivate him to achieve his goals. He will use the loan he is requesting to make the most of the discounts he receives and reduce the cost of merchandise.

He is married with three children. He has been a farmer for the past 12 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production; he needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing, as well as seed and fertilizer from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He is requesting a loan, which he will use to purchase fertilizer and pay for labor costs during maize production. He  needs fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing, as well as seed and fertilizer from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1444199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and pay for labor costs ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Jean Nepomuscene\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":600875,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":777,"local_amount":518756,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":519795.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279540},{"amount":123,"local_amount":82119,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82283.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490976685}],"funded_date":"2013-10-23T09:30:37Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":615233,"name":"Maferah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 50-year-old Maferah from Jui eastern area in Freetown.

She ventured into retail trade in 1997 after consistent unpredictable rainy seasons in the area hence she could not raise enough food and income from her farm to take care of her family. She started a retail store trading in bicycles and bicycle spare parts. This idea was triggered by the poor means of transport used by the residents of her village at that time. \r\n\r\nMargret has since diversified into motorcycle spare parts due to an increase in the number of motorcycles in the region, and she has plans to sell motorcycles in the near future. Margret was introduced to the solar lanterns which provide bright and safe lighting and come with a mobile charging function by BrazAfric green energy marketing team. Because of the recurring cost and health effects associated with paraffin which is the commonly used lighting fuel in her community, she saw an opportunity to boost her sales, increase productivity and raise the living conditions of people in the community. \r\n\r\nMargret appreciates the benefits accruing from the use of solar lanterns, and with the Kiva financing option from Brazafric, she is seeking financing to purchase solar lanterns to stock and sell to her community. Margret points out that she would buy some solar lanterns to use in her farm and also for her shop to increase her working hours."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1444151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy solar lanterns","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"KINYAMBU-MAKUENI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":213,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":154260,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15426},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15426}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-20T08:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449601993},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-14T09:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067159},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-14T09:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880131},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-14T09:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479103758},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-21T08:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490798900},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504222024},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-12T10:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517509970},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-12T10:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529992542},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542484345},{"amount":180,"local_amount":15426,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15553.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561617823}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T16:45:30Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:18:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":615234,"name":"Odette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Odette is 48 years old.

With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1444200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Odette\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":874000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":874000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1325,"local_amount":874000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":886394.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490976686}],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T16:59:33Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":615235,"name":"Muasya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muasya is a businesswoman who is very hard-working.

She lives there with her husband Rolando and her 22-year-old son, both of whom mean everything to her.  By nature, she is a very cheerful and sincere woman.  Nora sells hand-woven textiles from her stall in the craft centre in the town of San Pedro de Cajas.  She makes the clothes she sells herself and they are quickly snapped up by her customers because of her innovative designs.  She also stocks clothing made with different types of loom as well as tapestries from other local artisans.  Her favourite aspect of her work is weaving and developing her creative skills.  She has been doing this kind of work for 7 years and believes that the hardest part is having to remain behind her stall all day without being able to leave it.  She does not let this get her down, though, because she knows that she has to sell her goods as quickly as she can so that she can have a day off every 3 weeks. When her husband gets home from the mine where he works, they spend most of their time together.  In addition to running her textile business, she also does some farming, planting potatoes once a year.  Because she is achieving her goals, she hopes that, in time, she will be able to have a bigger shop where she can serve her customers more comfortably.  This is her fourth KIVA loan and she is very grateful for the financial help, as it will enable her to improve her income.  She guarantees that she will repay her loan punctually.

The work is going well and he always has contracts to build houses.  He now also works in the afternoons as he wants his children to get ahead.  Mario has a motorcycle taxi which he uses to offer transportation to people who live in the city's outskirts.  Mario tells us that: \"In the afternoon there are more people about, so I work at this time\".  On Saturdays and Sundays he works with the motorcycle taxi all day long as there are a lot of people around, due to the cattle and food fairs held in the city.  Mario has had this business for ten years.  His secret is that he always keeps his vehicle in good condition.  He says, \"As well as looking after the vehicle, every year I sell it so as to buy a new one.  That way the value of the vehicle doesn't fall, and it doesn't get damaged\".\r\n\r\nThis is Mario's second Kiva loan.  He is grateful for this financial opportunity as it will help him to increase his income.  Mario promises to be punctual with his repayments.

What Elvira most likes about her work is the knitting.  She really enjoys this activity, something which can be seen in the finished product.  Elvira has been doing this work for 32 years.  In addition, Elvira sows potatoes one a year.  She does it only once a year so that the land is more fertile and produces a good product.  Elvira earns good profits with this work.  She also receives support from her husband who has a communal radio in the town.  In the future, Elvira hopes to save enough money to open a bigger shop to sell the artisan, woolen products.

The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1444218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for labor costs and fertilizer during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustin\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":786600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":786600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1036,"local_amount":679098,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":693060.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279542},{"amount":164,"local_amount":107502,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:15Z","rounded_local_amount":109712.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490976689}],"funded_date":"2013-10-30T10:37:59Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":615248,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 22-year-old single man from Jabalia city.

With profits from his farming Fidele wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1444277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to support labor and fertilizer costs during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-09T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-08T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Nepomuscene\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":874000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":874000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1143.92,"local_amount":754553,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":765253.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279548},{"amount":181.08,"local_amount":119447,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":121140.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490976696}],"funded_date":"2013-11-04T19:13:28Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":615290,"name":"Jaminatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Jaminatu, a 38-year-old from Jui in the eastern area from Freetown.

With the profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that, in the future, he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near Tanzania. Inconsistent rains, especially recently, have made farming difficult, and the poverty rates in the county are above the Kenyan average. \r\n\r\nBeekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passion fruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies.
