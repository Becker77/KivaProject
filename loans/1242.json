It is a visual expression of their identity, and can reflect their ethnicity, gender, politics, wealth and nationality. Each town prizes its own unique designs and many consider those from the large town of Chichicastenango to be among the most intricate and exquisite. They are handmade and very durable.\r\n\r\nChicua is a small, poor community near the town. Men, women and children face daily struggles to survive and move forward in their lives. The seventeen hard-working women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cLas Chicualenses\u201d have a vision for a better future, and look forward to their monthly meetings.\r\n\r\nThey are currently requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge, which will be their second loan cycle. The women\u2019s average age is 33 years and they have a very low level of education, with only a few having attended elementary school. Most do not write or speak in Spanish. The ladies have large families and are committed to providing for their children. They realize that education is a real key to a more successful future.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary for this loan cycle is 24 year old Antonia. As is customary for unmarried women in the rural, indigenous communities of Guatemala, Antonia lives with her parents and siblings. She was only able to attend school until she reached the 4th grade. Since childhood, Antonia has been using her talents to embroider and weave. Currently, she owns an embroidery business and makes beautiful sashes and blouses. As her business is growing, Antonio decided to apply for her second loan with Friendship Bridge, which she will use to purchase various high quality thread. Antonia will plan carefully as she wants to take advantage of the special orders that she has received. She anticipates more sales as the holidays approach. As Antonia works with her sister, the loan will become working capital for both of them. This is especially important as her sister is currently going through a divorce and needs to support herself and her own children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":1442851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase various high quality of thread to make clothes.

Together they form a family with a daughter who is going to school. Angie has been selling clothing, candy, school supplies and novelty items for 12 years. She says that she started selling her clothing door-to-door to her neighbors, friends and family members. She never liked to sell in squares or markets. In addition she always gave her customers the convenience of buying in two payments, and so far continues to do so. However this is Ange's greatest concern because many times people never finish paying her. \"I would like to sell on credit, but I understand we are in a community where there are not many sources of income, and even though I need the money right away and ask for immediate payment, I could lose customers\". \r\n\r\nAngie only sold clothing, but when she had the opportunity of having her own shop, her husband encouraged her to sell candy. She started by buying very small boxes of candy and now already has a table full of candy, cookies and soft drinks. \r\n\r\nAnge's business is very productive; she has many customers although there also days when sales are low.

The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1444226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-10T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-09T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Emmanuel\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":764750,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":764750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":764750,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":769323.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279543}],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T19:16:49Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T21:19:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":615352,"name":"Group 3 At Li\u00ean M\u1ea1c","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ly, first from the right in the front, is a 36-year-old farmer earning about $33 (700,000 VND) a month and supporting two school-age children.

The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and loses heat through its walls and windows.  She is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to buy a low pressure heater and vacuum-insulated windows.  The burning of coal is the main source of air pollution in Mongolia according to state research center.

The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance, in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

economics.  Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\"I studied at physics \u2013 mathematics school-lyceum No61 and was always interested in mathematics. In senior classes, we started having lessons in economics which were very interesting, especially the role of mathematics in economics. That is why I decided to continue developing my interests and enroll in the economics department.  Also, my choice was influenced by the fact that economics is an integral part of daily life. A person deals with economy when they think how much money they have to save for a new purchase, how much they have to pay for repairs, how the inflation influences their salary, how to save money etc.  Economy also helps to answer the issues in the sphere of entrepreneurship and economic activity, how to determine what it means to increase the net profit and to provide employees with satisfactory salary, how the relations with foreign partners influence activities, and supply and demand at the market. The knowledge of economy allows me to follow and understand the situations in the world. Today our country is in need of competent specialists in different areas.  The economy of our country is unstable and I would like to help Kyrgyzstan. Our country has a great potential. I have a possibility to make an effort to improve the economic situation of our country.\r\nThe American University in Central Asia is one of the leading universities in Kyrgyzstan, keeping up with the times, and its graduates are recognized with employment. AUCA is a basic step for many successful people. In Kyrgyzstan, you can meet graduates of AUCA who can perform their duties at an excellent level. I would also like to take an active role in the social life of AUCA. \r\nAUCA is the place that I always was looking for, the place where I wanted to be and I am happy that my dream came true.\"\r\n  \r\nAt the same time, Nelly wonders about the financial part of this issue, as her family cannot afford paying the tuition fees. But she doesn\u2019t want money to stop her from her studies. A Kiva loan would let Nelly be more concentrated on her studies, not on thinking about how to earn money for her tuition. The American University of Central Asia has been the university of her dreams for years and she doesn\u2019t want financial restrictions to be a barrier for her future success.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1444560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Due to Eid ul Azha, she has lot of pending work for completion but without a speedy machine it seems impossible to sew cloths before Eid.\r\nTherefore, Nargis requested a loan to buy a Juki sewing machine so that she could sew cloths by a specific time.

Syeeda himself has only studied up to the fifth year of middle school. \r\nHer husband is a rickshaw driver, and he transports passengers through the streets of his city. He puts forth a lot of effort into his job and he works about 12 hours every day and attends to about 80 customers. He tells us that every day is a good day because he is able to return home with money for household costs, which gives Syeeda a little peace at the end of the day.  He believes that his business is going well because he has a lot of faith in God and believes that God guides him.  For this reason, he always has something to take home because he is honest, honorable and respects his customers.\r\n\r\nSyeeda is actually very grateful for Kiva loan.  This would be the first time that they have given her their support and with it she will be able to make improvements for her family. Her husband will buy new tires and change the seats on his rickshaw, and with these improvements, he will be able to improve his customers' comfort and thus obtain higher earnings.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nSonia hopes to expand her business, and dreams to have a good life and happy family. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His plan now is to continue to work on his business and to make it grow. Shota applied for the credit with MFO Credo.

He will buy supplies such as sugar, soft drinks, snacks and more to better stock his store. With this financial support, Shota will generate income, which will help him expand his grocery store in the future and attract more customers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nUrwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1444715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-10T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-09T12:10:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vincent\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":874000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":874000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1143.92,"local_amount":754553,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":766941.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279551},{"amount":181.08,"local_amount":119447,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":121408.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490976700}],"funded_date":"2013-11-07T15:43:53Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T19:54:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":615506,"name":"Julius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julius is a 20-year-old young man, married and a father of a three-month-old baby.

Each year from September to November she works in the rice field with her son and husband to grow and then sell the rice. When the rice season ends she she is engaged in selling livestock until the spring. Her husband also works as a security guard at a collective farm, for seasonal work does not provide a continuous income. Inoyat and her family are planning to buy a vehicle to transport livestock, because they live far away from the city and it is difficult for them reach downtown and deliver livestock or rice.

She will use the Kiva loan to pay labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase her production. With the profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business.  In the future she hopes she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

The density of the old growth trees in the Kakamega forest, and the variety of crops grown in the area, make this an excellent area for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nJeremiah is married, and has six children. His wife runs a small business, while Jeremiah is involved with projects on their land. He has been farming for forty-seven years, and is currently growing bananas and vegetables, raising cattle, and keeping beehives of his own. Jeremiah is excited to get more hives, as he says \"I love honey, the income I will make from it, [and] I need the bees to help me in pollinating my crops.\"\r\n\r\nThis is Jeremiah's first loan with Kiva, and he plans to use the income from his hives to pay his children's school fees and expand the number of projects on his land. In the future, Jeremiah's dream is to expand his land, start more projects, and eventually construct rental houses.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1444782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to support labor costs and pay for fertilizer for rice production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-10-10T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-09T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boniface\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":793830,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":793830}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":793830,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":804542.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279559}],"funded_date":"2013-10-27T06:16:59Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T21:19:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":615560,"name":"Humaira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Humaira, resident of Rawalpindi (Pakistan), is a 45-year-old lady.

With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThis loan is part of Urwego Opportunity Bank's program targeting farmers who are members of cooperatives. The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

The loan goes to the cooperative's leader (pictured) on the group's behalf, and all borrowers benefiting from this loan receive financing such as quality seeds from the Rwandan government. The loan is also covered by insurance in case of crop failure. As the cooperative's leader, Victoire is responsible for repaying the loan\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

and Comparative Politics, and here is his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery final year students choose their profession. Someone becomes an engineer and plans buildings, someone becomes a doctor and saves lives. Of course, all of those professions are important, but there is one which the whole country or even the world depends on. I think that one is politics. Politicians can change the world. They rule the past, present, and future.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, I realized that I started studying the subject of politics earlier than I thought before. In my secondary school, I was interested in international history. Especially, I was interested in politics and the political system of American politicians. \r\n\r\n\"My favorite politician is Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd president of the United States. I was impressed by his charm, influence, and firmness. Despite his disability, he was not afraid of difficulties and he always worked for his country\u2019s interest. Also, he is the only president of the United States who was elected more than two times, he was elected four times. \r\n\r\n\"Influenced by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I started to get interested in the lives of politicians. In a short period of time, I have read many books, articles, and encyclopedias about famous politicians. So, I opened myself to the big and interesting world of politics. \r\n\r\n\"Browsing through the information brochure and the University\u2019s home page, I felt that undergraduate studying in AUCA can give me a lot. First, it has highly qualified professors with great educational background and working experience. They received their Masters degrees and PhDs in the United States. \r\n\r\n\"After four years of studies at AUCA, I have a definite plan for my future, which is applying for a Masters degree from a university abroad. In order to know more about other political systems and build some experience, I will participate in extra activities such as debates, conferences, and other activities. I will also visit lectures of famous politicians and professors. I am really interested in political science and am ready to devote myself to this very area. \r\n\r\n\"Taking an opportunity, I would like to apply for a Kiva loan, which is open to all AUCA students. I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that this is another unique opportunity which AUCA gives to its students. I am happy to be part of such a great university.\u201d

Mamie was unfortunate not to attend school, but she started a table market business which sells red oil in the local market. With the loan proceeds, she will buy enough red oil to increase her sales. Her problem is fewer goods on her table. She got money from her husband to establish this business 5 years ago, and she learned by observing other businesswomen. She enjoys the flos of costumers. Her plan is to move from the table business to a shop business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1446062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict

Zena has had a mamalishe (street food) business for three years now. She works from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm daily and is able to earn a good monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used her previous loan to buy food cooking supplies like maize and baking flour, beans, rice, sugar and firewood for cooking. She is doing great in her business and managed to pay back her loan successfully. She used her profit to cover household expenses and school fees.  Zena will use this loan to buy more food cooking supplies for her business.

Stany is very excited to be receiving his third loan from HOPE Congo after having successfully paid off his previous loans. He has had his business for around seven years. He owns an electronics store, specializing in accessories such as memory cards and flash drives. He says his biggest challenge so far has been controlling theft by employees and customers. Stany has been keeping a log of customer purchases, so he understands what is selling the best in his store. With this next loan he will be buying some of his bestselling items which include CD's, DVD's, memory cards, and flash drives.

The two previous loans were paid back in full. This group of women are in the firewood trade, just like Oumou, the third woman from the left who is sitting down in the photo. With this loan, she will purchase 1 truckload (10 tons) of firewood with the villagers. She sells wood from her home, working with cash and credit, to both male and female customers.

Her village is far from the city. Three years ago, she began her own business, not in farming or livestock like other people but in trading food products. Since she lives in a rural area and there is little competition, it is easy for her to cope with the business. She purchases goods wholesale from the city market and sells them at retail prices at her shop. She is a sociable and kind woman and therefore she succeeds in making an individual approach to each customer. \r\n\r\nShe wants to expand her business and receive more income.

","en":"Mukaddas lives with her husband and three children far from the city in a rural area and is engaged in raising livestock. Before starting her own business, it was very hard for her to manage the family expenses. Her husband earned a little and his income was not enough to support a family.

Her children are three and one year old. While still at her parents\u2019 home, she learned how to sew women\u2019s clothing. This trade has helped her a lot in life. Her husband does not make sufficient money to provide the family with all necessities. For over nine years, Gulnora has been working as a seamstress. She provides high-level service and tries to attract new customers. Gulnora has been a client of IMON in the past.

Keto has also a son, who lives and works in Austria and helps his family financially.\r\n\r\nAs the majority of middle-aged Georgian women, Keto stays home and takes care of her house. She is an excellent mother and tries to give her children all the best. Keto sorrows that she is not able to generate income for the family; that is why she had decided to start her own business and go to Turkey to purchase apparel and linens to sell.

I was struck by an amazing and unique atmosphere that prevails at this university. Even the walls emit some kind of furious energy, an energy of joy, desire to learn, to grow and be leaders. Remarkably, there aren\u2019t any universities in our country where it is possible to feel such an amazing spirit of unity and friendship, and a sense that these fifteen hundred students are bold steps to make this world a better place. AUCA also differs in its approach to each student, and a unique system of education. It is the only university in which you can get pleasure from every minute spent here.\r\n\r\nI started thinking about the choice of my future profession a long time ago. At first I wanted to be a linguist, then a psychologist, and then a marketer, and finally, I came to the conclusion that I want to be a journalist. I want journalism to be developed in our country. I want to bring the national media to a new level, to do something new in this area. I want to be a journalist, because this profession opens up the world of people and events, and makes it possible for people to rethink their views and opinions, helping them to evolve spiritually and move forward. It shows people all aspects of that which we have to think about. Journalism is some type of self-expression, and by expressing his ideas, a journalist illuminates life changes, over time. A journalist, as a modern educator, brings into our lives novelty and food for thought, so this is a profession where I would like to work.\r\n\r\nAUCA provides a lot of different opportunities: perfect knowledge of foreign languages, the ability to make your own schedule at your convenience, and chose subjects which you are interested in. There are prospects for further education and a career abroad. The diverse student cohort at AUCA offers the chance to become acquainted with people of different nationalities, their cultures, traditions, and mentality.\r\n\r\nAUCA gives another opportunity; it gives a loan through KIVA, which is a great opportunity for all the students to cover their tuition fees. So, taking an opportunity I am also applying for a KIVA loan, which will help me to cover my tuition.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1440222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

It is as important as a choice of profession. So in order to love your future job, you must not make a mistake, not only with the choice of profession but also with a choice of a proper university. I had a very big desire to study at AUCA and I am happy that my dream came true. AUCA will help me to get the best education, new opportunities and a bright future.\r\n\r\nNowadays education is the main tool to attain all your aims and become a successful person. If in the past the strongest person was one who had a powerful weapon, now it is brains and an acquired education. I think that AUCA has all the resources to give opportunities to students who try to get higher knowledge. One of the most important factors is the professional teaching staff which consists of experienced objective Kyrgyz and foreign professors who give significant knowledge and teach students both theoretically and practically. \r\n\r\nAUCA is a place with new opportunities and new people for me. I can get acquainted with more people and thus, have more possibilities to share my feelings, opinions and just spend a good time with them. Fortunately, this year I had a chance to be a dance instructor for AUCA students in one important event and I found many friends there. I know that because of the American system of education I have an opportunity to choose different subjects and study with different students on each course. When I enter the building of AUCA, I immediately feel an absolutely diverse and very pleasant atmosphere, like I am in another world. Besides, in this university I will have different opportunities, since AUCA provides students with different internships, projects, student programs, clubs and extracurricular activities. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my family is unable to cover the tuition fees fully. Therefore I am applying for a Kiva loan. Kiva loans are one of great opportunities that AUCA gives to each student."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1441051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Administration and here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have chosen to apply to AUCA because it brings innovative ways of education to people that are seeking knowledge.  One of the main things I do really enjoy is that no person is forced to make a decision on his career and life during the entrance to the university.  Personally I was in the middle of cross roads deciding whether to pursue a career in the field of business or engineering.  I was always fond of working in a team, being a leader who inspires everyone and also taking advantage in learning from experiences of others.  I believe both engineering and business are successful when a person can cooperate with others and bring in new different ideas to the table.\r\n\r\nKyrgyzstan is a perfect place for new developing small business because of its location, nature and costs of living compared to other places in the world.  It would be mutually beneficial for Kyrgyzstan and small businesses to help the business grow and expand out to CIS and later on go global.  As a result, the whole world would discover Kyrgyzstan for themselves and if they decide to visit us, they would fall in love with our country from the first visit.  I believe that will help our country achieve and maintain politically stable situation and increase political and economic awareness among people. \r\n\r\nI want to pursue my bachelor degree at the American University of Central Asia, because I think it would be the ideal place for me to understand myself,  and gain invaluable knowledge and experience to further help my country develop.  Hopefully, the AUCA community will help me to build up and shape myself. \r\n\r\nI also want to mention that AUCA gives great opportunities, which is financial aid. I would like to apply for a Kiva loan, which is available for every student of AUCA.\u201d

International and Comparative Politics, and below is her story.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a little girl, one day I wanted to be a teacher, and the next day I wanted to be a doctor. In the sixth grade, I was elected President of my class. I think that was the time when I started to create myself.\r\n\r\nI was President of my class for five years. This experience taught me to be a responsible leader; it taught me to work in a team. I was a member of the Debate Club at school. I remember that debates about human rights, terrorism or politics were the most interesting for me. I noticed that headlines about politics or laws always attracted my attention. So, when the time came, I had to make a decision about what I wanted to study at college. In the beginning I was asking my family and friends, but then I thought that it was my life and it was only my decision. \r\n\r\nI started thinking about what I liked and what I was good at. I applied to International and Comparative Politics because this is the program that most attracts my attention among the other programs that AUCA offers. I have always been passionate about such subjects as human rights, international organizations, political violence, terrorism, international law and others that the AUCA International Comparative Politics (ICP) program offers. \r\n\r\nI believe that ICP offers education in a field that will always be important, especially for Kyrgyzstan. Specialists with an ICP degree will be in demand on the labor market. My goal is to have a job of a lifetime, that I will be passionate about and that I will love. I think that if a person has a job that he or she likes that person can be really successful in life. If I have a successful career that I love, my family will be proud of me and I will be happy. My ultimate goal is to create change for myself, my family, friends and my country. \r\n\r\nI was a participant in a program called FLEX [Future Leaders Exchange Program]. Living in America was a life-changing experience. I changed my perception of life; I became more active and ambitious. I started to ask questions and look for answers. I just really came to understand the value of life, the value of the time that we have - time that we cannot waste. \r\n\r\nMy American experience was full of things that I had never tried before. For example, I was able to meet people with disabilities. I saw the care system for people with special needs in the U.S and I realized that I had never questioned what was going on with special-needs people in Kyrgyzstan. That experience showed me that I wanted to help people. Maybe one day I will be a governor who will pass acts that will change Kyrgyzstan, or I will work in an international organization that helps Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nThere are some financial difficulties in my family though and therefore I am applying for Kiva loan. This Kiva loan will help me to fully dedicate myself to my education and not to worry about the money that will cover my tuition.\u201d

After four months of studies at the department of Management and Marketing, I had to come back to my home country due to some family reasons. My knowledge, leadership and communication skills are the most important values for being a successful businessman. The BA department at AUCA caught my attention more than other departments. I believe that the business trend in AUCA is based on knowledge and not corruption, which is very important for me. AUCA offers lots of possibilities for realizing my business ideas, organizing various projects, etc. I want to take an active part in the social life of AUCA, take the initiative and direction for me to acquire the knowledge that I am going to use in the implementation of my future projects and business ideas. In our country, even abroad, the majority of graduates of BA programs of AUCA work in good positions that help to keep the BA program one of the most promising areas. Once I finish this program, I see myself as a successful businessman and plan to open my own business centers, as well as launch a number of projects that will help to stabilize the economy of our country.\r\n\r\nThe only problem that I have is financial difficulties of my family. For this reason, I am taking an opportunity and applying for a Kiva loan, which will help me to cover my tuition fees.

When I was a child, my mother was always telling me, 'Always try to help people in need in every possible way.'  I grew up and these words have gradually turned into a goal. In the future, I want to open a charitable foundation. The main mission of this foundation will be construction of modern hospitals in Bishkek. I believe that studying in the department of Business Administration at the American University of Central Asia will lead me toward my goal. While studying in this department, I will learn useful skills that will help me to involve foreign investors and get different grants to build hospitals. I am applying for financial aid - a KIVA loan - which is a good opportunity for each student of AUCA. \r\n\r\nWhen studying at school I tried hard, so I think my gained knowledge will help me to enroll at the American University of Central Asia. During my studies at AUCA, I will take part in different activities, help other students, and be an active student of social life of AUCA.  My main goal is to be concentrated on achieving my plans, which I described above. Before the construction of hospitals I would like to visit some orphanages to bring joy, entertain and play with children. \r\n\r\nOverall, I want to devote my life to help people. I hope I will get partial financial aid, which could help me bring those thoughts to reality.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1439971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The professors of AUCA are all high qualified and all graduates find good jobs afterwards. During my preparations for AUCA admission exams I met with current students and people working at AUCA. All people are very polite and have really interesting personality. It was really enjoyable to communicate with them and I really want to study among them.\r\n\r\n\"AUCA is a heart of education. A lot of interesting and cognitive, local and international events are organized there. I also have friends that study at AUCA and I was curious about their impression of studies there. They rated it very high. They do really like the staff and atmosphere in this university.\r\n\r\n\"I am keen on debates. There is debate club in AUCA and it is very important for me. I know many debaters from AUCA and I am sure that AUCA will help me to improve my debate skills. AUCA debaters are the best in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\n\"Another great opportunity that AUCA gives to its students is that it gives loan to cover tuition fees. This loan is given through Kiva and all students entering AUCA are able to apply for it.

It is a subject which particularly interests me, because of its relevance to current economic issues and the potential it provides for employment in many areas. \r\nI have maintained a consistency excellent academic record that showcases my suitability for further study. Furthermore, my involvement in all classroom activities underlines my interest in expanding my knowledge. When I was in tenth grade I became a president of my high school. Being in this position helped me to gain leadership skills and improved my team-work as I always had to plan events and activities for the people in my school. While considering what career to choose, I was in the process of organizing good-bye-party for graduates. It was here that I began to draw parallels with my organizational skills and the world of Business Administration. Looking back at the holidays I organized, I believe the principles of Business Administration were at the very heart of my actions \u2013 effective communication, critical thinking, financial management and human resources. \r\n\r\nMy plans for the future include an extended academic relationship with American University of Central Asia, culminating in a Bachelor Degree in Business Administration. Then, I plan to go on to work in a successful, environmentally friendly company, strengthening it with my creative ideas, fostering innovative collaboration. I envision my work as contributing to positive, sustainable social change. I am especially passionate about the need to protect what is left of our pristine environments, and nurture or rebuild what has been destroyed. \r\n\r\nTo make all the above mentioned happen, I need a Kiva loan, and it is great that the American University of Central Asia gives its students such an opportunity.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1441021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

To earn a living for the family, Anahit is engaged in breeding livestock  (cattle, pigs and poultry). She also cultivates beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, greens, alfalfa, peaches, apricots, pomegranates, quince, apples and walnuts. As the family's needs are growing, Anahit needs to enlarge the agribusiness in order to cover those needs. She needs a loan of USD 1000 to purchase a pig, two calves, and some forage for the livestock. She has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to do it again. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Anahit was able to run the agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Anahit and her big family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them maintain their

","en":"Currently, Boymurod is actively working in animal husbandry. Regardless of the time and situation, he never leaves his animals and tries to constantly visit the barnyard. It has become a habit for him to rise early every day to feed and water the livestock. Boymurod tries to ensure that his animals are always well-fed and feel comfortable. This is because it is due to his livestock that Boymurod can provide his family with milk and an income. At the moment, he only has a few head of older cattle. Boymurod is worried for his family since their well-being depends on his income. Boymurod needs a loan to buy three calves for cattle breeding. He has repeatedly borrowed to develop his livestock

Guram is unemployed at the moment in spite of having high education. There is a high unemployment rate in the region especially among people up to the age of 40.  \r\n\r\nAs the existing income is not enough for the family and Guram can\u2019t find a job, he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Guram applied for the credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a start-up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.

She lives with her husband, her school age daughter and son (9 and 7 years old) and her little daughter (4 years old). \r\n\r\nLyudmila works as an administrative assistant in the village school. She is the only employed member of the family. Lyudmila, with the help of her husband, breeds cows, hens and turkeys. She also cultivates peaches, apricots, apples, pears and walnuts. Farming is a very important source of income for them. \r\n\r\nTo be able to cover the increasing needs of the family, Lyudmila currently needs a loan of USD 1500 to purchase a cow and to make previous credit repayments. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately she wasn't able to return it.
