Zarina has no college education since she did not have the opportunity to go to the university. She works sewing women's clothes at home. Zarina sews both traditional dresses as well as European-style clothing. Zarina handles the business herself. She is a very hardworking woman and therefore works not only sewing women's clothing, but also fattening cattle. Zarina wants to renovate her house and create normal living conditions for her child.

One can always see a great difference between one's first and last pieces of work, and this brings to mind the time when, having little experience in knitting silver, a friend of mine bought a pair of earrings I had made. It turned out her husband thought they were metallic sponges for washing pots! When I first heard about this I felt demoralized.

She and her husband have three children. In 2008, the couple started selling groceries in a shop they rented using 15,000 KGS as seed money. Since she has managed to grow her business and find regular customers, Anarkhan has an average monthly income of 15,000 KGS. Thanks to their hard work in the business, the couple were able to buy the store that they rented previously. In order to further improve and expand their business, Anarkhan approached the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 130,000 KGS to buy food and beverages wholesale that they can later resell.

He lives with his common-law partner.  During his working life he has been an employee on different farms in the region doing agricultural work and acquiring knowledge in all the agricultural jobs.\r\n\r\nCurrently William works raising cows to sell milk, which he does on a plot of land he's renting.  He sells his milk production to generate the resources he needs to support his household.  \r\n\r\nHis drive, perseverance, and dedication have driven him to look for options for getting ahead, even overcoming a variety of obstacles that come up in his job.  The selling prices are low and don't always cover the high cost of agricultural inputs.  Nevertheless he has managed to handle the situation and overcome the difficulties.\r\n\r\nWilliam's requesting this loan to help keep on doing his job.  With the money he wants to buy more dairy cows to increase his production and make the most of his pastures to feed the animals.\r\n\r\nThis will allow him to improve his sales and his income and to continue doing his job.  In the future he'll have the opportunity to improve his family's living conditions and give his children a better education.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1449497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is married and his wife is a homemaker.  They have four children, but they are already grown up and married.  At home they live with six grandchildren; a 16-year-old girl in eighth grade, a five-year-old boy, another three-year-old boy, and two boys who are each two years old. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 farms for a living.  His parents taught him from a very young age.  During the cultivation season, which is in the winter, this is the only work he does.  However, during the dry season (summer) he works as a laborer.  His crops are approximately 2 km from his home and it takes him 30 minutes to get from his home to his land.  His older children and his wife help him with the farm work.  \r\n   \r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy two sacks of fertilizer and to pay people to help him work on his crops.  He will produce more staple grains to cover their food needs and last them through the end of the coming summer.  \r\n\r\nHis wish is to live comfortably with his family and his grandchildren and to offer them a better quality of life and above all to be at peace with God.  He also wants his grandchildren to be able to go to school and to get university degrees so they will be professionals.  He will use the profits from his crops to buy different kinds of food that he does not grow.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1449590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy two sacks of fertilizer and to pay people to help him with his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T00:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T00:00:21Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 In\u00e9s","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.46,"local_amount":104.46,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903348},{"amount":395.54,"local_amount":395.54,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":395.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216622}],"funded_date":"2013-10-14T03:46:07Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":615893,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcelina is applying for a loan of $1000.00 to improve her business and this is her first loan.

However, when Dr. Ray\u2019s partner closed his office, Ray was left to carry on the practice alone.\r\n\r\nAccording to the site, Ray, who is a clinical psychologist, offers his services with five years of graduate training in psychology.  His background includes stints at the Children\u2019s Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and a fellowship in pediatric neuropsychology at the University of Miami Medical School.\r\n\r\nRay specializes in neuropsychological testing, individual therapy, parent training, and behavior management. A full list of services he offers is on his website. \r\n\r\nBecause of the recent change within his business, Ray needed his own office to work in. He found an office, went to the bank for a loan, and then learned about nonprofit microlender, Accion Texas Inc. Once he applied and was approved, Ray used the loan to cover remodeling costs and other business expenses which will help reduce debt. \r\n\r\nRay says the absence of a loan could have resulted in suspension of his practice.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1445159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to finance an office by covering remodeling costs and other business expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Keller, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raymond","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":615904,"name":"Minda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a widowed parent of three children, Minda works hard to support her family.

She is married and works in transportation service. From her marriage she has a 30 year old daughter. They live comfortably together in their own house with 2 grandchildren whom they love very much. Tezalia works selling food from the region. She also has a passenger transportation service in a motorcycle taxi that she bought with her savings plus a private loan. At first she would rent it out but when she saw how quickly it deteriorated from the misuse of her vehicle she decided that her spouse would drive it to offer the service. She started 4 years ago when she bought her first vehicle and over time she renovated other units deteriorated from daily use, because she would buy them used. She likes her business because it allows her to have income to pay for her family's expenses. She started doing this work out of a need to have some income, since she was unable to find a job. Now she feels more secure. On the other hand, she says she doesn't like it when her motorcycle taxi breaks down often because that incurs unplanned expenses. Even so, she sees good results in her earnings. At this time, she is asking for  S\/. 1000. She is happy knowing that she has financial support that will allow her to advance with her business' progress. With the amount she has asked for, she will buy ingredients such as rice, meat, vegetables and more. She will also buy replacement parts for her motorcycle taxi.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1449564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She and her husband are raising three children. She has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry and crop farming, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business eight years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to Ainura's hard work, her farming business now comprises seven dairy cows, 51 sheep, as well as 2.15 hectares (5.3 acres) of land on which she grows beans, clover and corn every year. She makes a monthly income of 16,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her farming business, Ainura has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 135,000 som (KGS).

To achieve this, the greatest challenge to him is his work capital, which on its own is not enough to fulfill the growth expectations that Johann has.  For this reason, he is asking for a Kiva loan, which he will use to buy phone recharges, stationery, printer ink and two computers.  With his loan he will kick start his dream of modernization, which will allow an increase in his customer base leading to more income and a better way of life.  \r\n\r\nIt must also be added that Johann works 13 hours a day, every day of the week, including weekends to achieve his goals, large and small.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1449608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy cell phone recharges, stationery, printer ink and 2 computers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T06:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T06:10:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johann","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":105693},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":108864},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":112130},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":115494},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":118958},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":122527},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":126203},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":129989},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":133889},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":137905},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":142043},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":146305}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.31},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.37,"local_amount":105693,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-25T09:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":106659.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062500},{"amount":58.06,"local_amount":108864,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":109859.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732208},{"amount":59.8,"local_amount":112130,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":113155.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415421},{"amount":61.6,"local_amount":115494,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":116550.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104562},{"amount":128.79,"local_amount":241485,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":243693.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140267},{"amount":435.38,"local_amount":816334,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":823799.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542556}],"funded_date":"2013-11-10T06:09:19Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":616382,"name":"Laguna Azul Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cLAGUNA AZUL\u201d  iniciar\u00e1 el d\u00e9cimo cuarto ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Villa Tejada, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde el se\u00f1or V\u00edctor es el Secretario.

raising eight children. Ikayat has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Ikayat practices livestock breeding. She started this business 33 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 400 som (KGS). Thanks to Ikayat's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 1 heifer and 16 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Ikayat turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) to buy two heifers to increase the size of her herd. Ikayat plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to repair her

After the death of her husband, she raised two children on her own, and now runs her own homestead. Sharapat has a high school education. As a main source of income for her family, Sharapat is engaged in raising livestock, having started 23 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Sharapat today has on her homestead: four dairy cows and one sheep. Monthly income consists of 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her homestead, Sharapat turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase a cow and a calf for expanding the livestock headcount. \r\n\r\nSharapat plans to invest income from the loan to further increase the quantity of domestic

","en":"Pardabek is from the Zafarobod region. He is 36 years old. For nearly five years, Pardabek has been breeding cattle. Profit from raising livestock is the only source of income for the family. Pardabek is helped in running the business by his wife and eldest son. Currently, he has one steer in his barnyard. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy four heads of steer for increasing the count of salable cattle. For such a business as his, the size of loans is quite small because steer are very expensive. Pardabek loves his work and wants to expand. Raising steers, that is to care for and feed them, is not an easy job, but Pardabek is not afraid of challenges. \r\n\r\nHis work feeds Pardabek, his wife and children. He is the happy father of three sons. Pardabek loves his family very much and strives all the time for their well-being."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1448868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Zinat is a young, unmarried woman. She is 30 years old. She lives with her parents in the town of Vahdat. Zinat knows how to sew and cut women's national dresses, as well as to make beautiful embroidery on them. Until now, she has sewed only for herself. Now, Zinat has decided to use her skills and mastery on a professional level. She is going to start sewing and taking orders out of her home. She has already set aside a room for these activities. At her home she has an old sewing machine which is more than 30 years old. This machine is manual and therefore her hands will have to hold on the whole time to twist in order for her to work. \r\n\r\nZinat is requesting a loan for the purchase of a new modern machine, thanks to which she will be able to sew with more speed and quality. With the loan sum, Zinat wants to acquire a computerized sewing machine and fabric for sewing. She plans to sew one ordinary dress every day and one dress with embroidery. At the start of activities, she will be helped by her mother and sister."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":1448877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

Dilorom has a private farm and a few cattle. Her elder son is in the Russian Federation. She learned fattening cattle from an early age, as her parents have been doing this all of her life. For financial reason, Dilorom was not able to get an education, therefore she is involved in agricultural work and raising livestock. At the moment, this is the only income for their family.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, Dilorom drives her cattle to pasture as there are many grasses, and after lunch she is involved in growing crops. Dilorom is a very good and hardworking person. She never sits idle.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRoribel hopes to have a grocery store someday and dreams that her children will have a good future.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is living in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her husband and six sons. All of her children are studying in third class. Her husband is a security guard and his income is not enough to meet the household expenses. For four years Aasba has been running a beauty salon, and she wants to purchase some more cosmetic products and chairs for her beauty salon. For that reason, she has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan. On getting a profit, first of all she will repay the loan amount to Kiva, and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is too congested. She hopes that her business grows more and she is very thankful to both BRAC and Kiva.

","en":"Maura, 47, is mother of four children aged 11, 14, 15 and 22 years.  As a separated woman she has been earning income as a merchant for the last year to support her home.  Her business is selling varied merchandise.  She started when a friend of hers suggested items with special prices to sell and she built up her own clientele.\r\n\r\nMaura started off selling women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothing and household items among her closest neighbors and friends.  Little by little she\u2019s been investing in the business and recouping what she spends.  She sells items her experience tells her are the most attractive to customers door to door.  Her present challenge is the large amount of competition that exists offering similar products at better prices.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to make her clientele grow and to carry out more effective negotiations with her suppliers which she will be able to accomplish by making volume purchases that will allow her to get better prices to pass on to her buyers.  \r\n\r\nThis is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy comforters, sheets and clothes for women, men and children to take advantage of the approaching end-of-year festivities.  Her customers are already placing orders for merchandise to be ready for Christmas and New Year\u2019s to look elegant and together spend family time enjoying a non-stop feast of hugs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1450210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bedspreads, sheets and clothes for women, men and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maura Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":52097},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":54410},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":56042},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":57723},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":59455},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":61239},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":63076},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64968},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66917},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68925},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":70993},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74155}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":52097,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-28T09:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52443.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062502},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":54410,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":54771.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732210},{"amount":29.89,"local_amount":56042,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":56414.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415423},{"amount":30.87,"local_amount":57882,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":58266.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104564},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":120535,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":121336.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140269},{"amount":33.64,"local_amount":63076,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":63495.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834154},{"amount":34.65,"local_amount":64968,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":65400.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530025828},{"amount":144.06,"local_amount":280990,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":282858.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.8,"payment_id":562430680}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T00:02:29Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":616125,"name":"Hussein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hussein is a 20-year-old Lebanese single man.

He lives in a remote area, where the residents travel to town just twice a year to purchase food products.  In the wintertime, there is no way to access the village. Amon and his fellow villagers mostly grow potatoes. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Amon went to Russia. Amon has suffered many difficulties in life. Since Amon was not educated as a child and has no profession, he also encountered many difficulties in Russia. When he was in Russia, his wife was left with small children and was growing potatoes. Amon has worked hard to educate his son and found a private school for him to attend. His son Shamsullo attended a private school and has received several commendations from the school administration. Hoping to better his son's future, Amon took his son to Russia after he finished high school. Shamsullo enrolled at Krasnoyarsk State Medical University named after Professor Voyno- Yasenetsskogo in the medical faculty. The father is very happy for his son's success and has requested a loan from IMON to cover his son's tuition. He looks forward to your generosity and compassion."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1448986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for the education of his son ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":157.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":162.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":163.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":162.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":171.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":168.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":174.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":174.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":175.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":179.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":180.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":182.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":185.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":187.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":189.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":191.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":194.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":195.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":619200,"name":"Maria Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera por viudez, vive en el municipio de Villanueva, Cortes junto a sus dos hijos.

","en":"Rahmatjon is an experienced jeweler who lives in the city of Dushanbe. He is 30 years old and a family man. Rahmatjon has worked for many years creating and repairing gold and silver jewelry, and now he has enough experience to start his own business. Rahmatjon plans to take custom orders and to make jewelry repairs. He has already made agreements with vendors at the market to sell his jewelry pieces.

years old and has 5 children.  Some time ago, he finished his post-secondary studies and was able to land a government job as an engineer.   Additionally, he has been fattening cattle for the past 15 years; fattening cattle has a seasonal character to it, and serves to provide additional income for Ernazar and his wife.  Their children have already grown up, and their parents want them to go to college and work in whichever fields they decide to go into.

He works selling parts for motorcycles and motorcycle taxis, and he does tire repairs, oil changes, lube jobs, engine overhauls and other services. Ray also buys and sells small second-hand vehicles, which he restores to optimal condition so that he can resell them at a good price.\r\n\r\nRay runs his business from his own air-conditioned shop attached to his home. He displays the parts that his customers need, such as pistons and rings, spark plugs, tires, mud flaps, telescopic forks, headlamps and brakes. Ray thinks that his business does very well because the number of motorcycles and motorcycle taxis in the city is constantly increasing and there is a high demand for his products.

He purchases scrap metals (particularly copper) and sells it to local companies or factories. Due to his hard work and good communication skills, Ararat has several contracts with companies that are purchasing copper from him. So he purchases copper from individuals and sells it to local companies, thus gathering income from the difference. Now Ararat needs financial support to be able to purchase new stock of copper and sell it to customers.\r\n\r\nHe has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. So the loan is very important for Ararat to be able to continue his retail business, and he will be very grateful to all his lenders for the support.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1445626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"new stock of copper to sell to customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Yerevan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ararat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20771},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":21660},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":21695},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20959},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":22834},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":23149},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":22313},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23777},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23480},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":23642},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24571},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24576},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24951},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25482},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25859},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25747},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":26844},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":27214},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27254},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":27896},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":28181},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":28612},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":29078},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29455}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":616181,"name":"Tatevik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tatevik is 35 years old.

She does not want to fail to repay it for lack of money so she commits to be very punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,000 soles to buy motorcycle and mototaxi spare parts as well as some tools used in her work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1450334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts and tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":296.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":318.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":330.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":332.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":355.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":366.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":296.56,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":299.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905763},{"amount":115.45,"local_amount":318.47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":321.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091747},{"amount":119.75,"local_amount":330.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":333.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778342},{"amount":120.58,"local_amount":332.64,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":335.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598749},{"amount":128.71,"local_amount":355.06,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":358.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147650},{"amount":133.01,"local_amount":366.93,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-06T10:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":370.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240750}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T10:14:39Z","paid_date":"2014-11-06T10:46:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":619268,"name":"Saturnina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Saturnina, de 42 a\u00f1os , esta casado y tiene tres hijas de  03, 04, 06 de edad respectivamente .
