He owns a small oven where he cooks pork and sells it to locals. Now, because of financial difficulties that the family currently faces, Artur lacks financial means to renovate his oven. He has requested this loan to purchase meat and renovate the oven. Artur has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan is very important for Artur to be able to increase his capital and provide better service to his customers.

She sells the final products at local small markets and also to individual customers. Over years of hard work Gyulnara was able to have a good client base. \r\n\r\nNow this hard-working woman needs financial support to be able to purchase fabric for tailoring linen. Lately she has got a big order from one of the city shops, and she needs to prepare a big portion of linen for them. So, in order to purchase fabric for tailoring linen Gyulnara has applied for this loan. \r\n\r\nShe has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products.

He is currently employed in a barbershop, where he has gained a lot of experience, but he wants to have his own business. With the help of a previous loan, David decided to convert a space in his home to start his own barbershop. He says that he already has a lot of customers, and that he has been cutting hair outside of work, both in his customers homes and in the makeshift setup in his house.\r\n\r\nDavid works very hard every day, balancing the hours he is scheduled to work in the barbershop with his independent work. He says that he does this to supplement his income so that he can contribute to his family\u2019s finances. David also helps his younger brother to pay for a training course in barbering, because his brother wants to work with him in the barbershop. \r\n\r\nDavid is requesting his second loan to make improvements to his business. He says that he needs to install a restroom, and that he will use the loan to buy a toilet, sink, urinal, construction materials such as cement and tile, and to pay for labor. David says that the loan will allow him to finish his barbershop, which will let him provide better customer service in a space independent from the family\u2019s living area. With the restroom installed, he will be able to fully work in his business, which he hopes will be very successful. David hopes to increase his income so that he can realize his dream of paying for his university education.

She started this business with a little amount of money that she received from her husband, and she learned how to do it from her mother. What she likes about this business is that it helps her to pay her children's school fees on time.

She is married with 4 children. PMPC supported her by providing the capital to start her pig-raising business. She sold one pig at a time, helping the family to survive. She gives her best efforts to produce good pigs, in order to sell them continuously. \r\n\r\nFrancisca is now trying to expand her pig business and has decided to venture into swine production. She presented her project proposal to Paglaum MPC to finance the project and has applied for a loan of PHP 15,000. She wants to earn more profit in order to have enough income to meet the daily needs of their family and hopes to save some of her income for unexpected expenditures in the future.

When her father, Pedro, couldn\u2019t work as a farmer any more because of his age, Maria Elena employed her mother as an assistant at the salon. \n\nMaria Elena has been running her business for the last 15 years and making around $700USD a month.  However, Maria Elena was recently divorced and her parents welcomed her back to their home to give her and her children a place to live.  Maria Elena is saving to one day have her own place so tries to avoid complaining about the small space and the fact that she shares a tin ceiling bedroom with her kids and a bathroom with the rest of the house.  Juana knows the space is too small, and that it will be years before her daughter can save enough to move to a house of her own. \n\nJuana is thankful to her daughter for giving Pedro and her an income.  In return, Juana has been saving to build a new bedroom, install proper roofs and build a bathroom for the new family members in the house.

As the store is her main source of income, she hopes the loan will help in the expansion of her business and will help her to meet the daily needs of her family.

Like the majority of the residents of this region, he has decided to go into the cattle raising business.  He has only one milking cow, which provides the milk for his children.  He wants to buy two cows and start a business in fattening cattle for resale.  Muhiddin will take care of the cattle himself.  He has 1,000 Tajik somoni for his startup capital.  As this is too small an amount to start the business, he applied for a loan for the rest of the money he needs.  \r\n\r\nMuhiddin plans to buy two cows, which he explains will form the basis of his business.  In the future, with the income that they bring, he plans to expand his herd.  If everything goes according to his plans, he, his wife, and children will have a good life.  These two cows will be the beginning of their bright future.  Please help Muhiddin buy them so he can start his

year old widow.  Since her husband's death, she alone has been raising their four children as well as running her own business.  Anarbubu has a secondary level education and her family's main source of income is the animal husbandry business she started four years ago with a purchase of 8,000 somi (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today she has two milking cows and 20 sheep.  Her monthly income comes to 3,500 somi (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Anarbubu applied to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 65,000 somi (KGS) to expand her herd by buying sheep.  Anarbubu plans to invest the profits from her loan in further expanding the size of her herd.  She also plans to save up money for making repairs to her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1449731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor village, Naryn region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1350,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":65934.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553169}],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T03:18:15Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:13:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":616541,"name":"Melecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melecia is 53 years old and married, with seven children who are mostly grown.

Drupadi is one of them. The young lady of 29 years standing second from left in the photo, raising her hand, is Drupadi. She   lives with her husband; one daughter aged 8 and one son of 4 years old.\r\n \r\n Drupadi has been running a general grocery shop in her village for last six years with the help of her husband. She started the business in a very low profile manner with a small investment of her own. At that time her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR. It was very difficult on the part of Drupadi to maintain her family. After formation of the group to date Drupadi has already accessed four loans amounting 10,000, 14,000, 18,000 & 20,000 and gradually developed her grocery shop by adding new items like a freezer for selling cold drinks, etc. \r\n\r\nPresently she is earning a monthly income of 10,000 INR, but according to her this is not sufficient to materialize her dream. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the amount of inventory. She wants to increase her stock of raw materials. So according to Drupadi, the present loan of 40,000 INR will be utilized to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store.

They formed a group named \u201cMaa Santoshi-1\u201d to avail credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing businesses. \r\n\r\nSabitri is one of the group members. She is standing third from the right with her hand raised in the photo. She is 45 years old and lives with her husband, one son of 21 years and one daughter of 18 years of age. \r\n\r\nSabitri hails from a traditional cloth-weaving community. She has been running a cloth-weaving business with her husband. Presently she has three hand looms for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader 20 km away from her village. They knit 80 to 100 pieces from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Sabitri has engaged two workers for the initial processing and weaving of saris. She only produces saris because of the demand in the market. Sabitri gets five pieces of sari per day. \r\n\r\nShe sells her products to the local traders, who come to take the products from her home on a weekly basis. From this business, she earns a monthly income of 10,000 rupees, which is not sufficient to materialize her future dream. With the present loan of 36,000 INR Indian rupees), she wants to buy thread\/yarn in bulk. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing and transportation costs of the raw materials. \r\n\r\nSabitri wishes to grow her business and save enough to complete her half-constructed house.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Snehalata, Baidaihi and Manjula, doing a mobile servicing centre and milk business, cloth vending and sweet items making, and weaving business respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1446077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase thread\/yarn in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhuliasikuan,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baidaihi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Snehalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manjula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":152000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":152000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T17:41:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":616547,"name":"Bernadette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernadette is a forty-four year-old single mother of three children, living in Kasese, Uganda.

She and her husband are raising five children.  In 2003 she and her husband started a grocery business in a rented storefront, with a startup capital of 15,000 somi (KGS).  Having successfully developed their business and winning over regular customers, Parzaiym has an average monthly income of 20,000 somi (KGS).  As a result of their hard work in their business, she and her husband were able to buy the storefront, which they had previously rented.  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further expansion and growing of their business, Parzaiym applied to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 somi (KGS) to make a wholesale purchase of grocery products and chilled drinks for later retail sale.  Parzaiym plans to invest the profits from the loan in increasing their inventory and to save up money for opening a second location."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1449768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy food for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Uzgen village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T20:30:10Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Parzaiym","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7079},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7286},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7498},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7717},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7942},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8174},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8412},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8657},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8910},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":9170},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":9437},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":9718}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":619369,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He is married and has two children.  For now, he and his family live in his parents' house, but Tolibjon is the tenth child in the family and has many brothers and sisters.  All of them live live in their parents' house, which really isn't all that big.  Because of this, Tolibjon started building his family a house of its own.

Dulabhi, the energetic lady of 24 years sitting second from right with raised hand, is one of them. She is very active and always cheerful. Her family consists of her husband; one son aged seven and one daughter aged five years.\r\n\r\nOver the last 10 years, Dulabhi has been running a cloth vending business with the help and support of her husband. This is their traditional business. She   purchases ready made garments and saris from a wholesale market 200 kilometers away. Her husband moves to different villages and weekly markets on a bike to sell saris and garments. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from her existing business. But the present income is not sufficient to manage the business expenses as well as the household expenses of her family. So Dulabhi wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan from Mahashakti Foundation and looking ahead to the coming festive season, from the present loan of 40,000 INR she is planning to purchase some quality saris and fancy garments to sell. Dulabhi assumes that this will definitely generate a handsome sum in extra income. Dulabhi has a dream to save enough for construction of a good house. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Kousalya, Jhingati and Purnama running a cloth vending business, general store & cloth vending and Tiffin centre, and  fancy store businesses.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1446072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing quality saris and fancy garments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhuliasikuan,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T20:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T20:40:09Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dulabhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhingati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kousalya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":160000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T03:18:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":616554,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 28 years old and she is now applying for a loan of $1000 to improve her business.

Khujand.  This city means a lot to him.  It's where he was born, grew up, studied and married.  He also works here.  Abdugani is an expert in repairing and remodeling apartments.  He plasters walls, and installs stoves, tile, plasterboard, floors and paneling.  Unfortunately, his work is seasonal in nature and now with the coming of winter's cold, he doesn't have any work at all.  Abdugani decided to start a new, supplemental business so that his family won't be left without any support. \r\n\r\nHis friend made Abdugani a offer to go into a profitable business together selling electronics since his friend has sales experience.  Abdugani decided to start the business using only a small amount of money.  He plans to buy only two computers and their accessories, so it's not a large amount of money.  He is requesting a loan for this purchase since his own startup capital is only $300 (USD).  Abdugani is hoping the business will be a success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1448886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

Tikrapada is a remotely located rural village ten kilometres away from the township. \r\n\r\nThe lady standing second from the left with a raised hand in the photograph is Laxmi. She is a very active and energetic lady. She lives with her husband and one son of four years in a small hut. She belongs to a Below Poverty Line category family. The main source of income for Laxmi is preparing puffed rice and selling it. Laxmi processes the rice and makes puffed rice, and her husband sells it by moving from village to village by bicycle. For the last ten years, Laxmi and her husband have been involved in this business. \r\n\r\nDue to the lack of finances, Laxmi is running this business in a very low-profile manner.  Presently she is earning around 2,000 INR (Indian rupees) per month from this business, so it is very hard for her to manage her family and think of the future. So, to increase her business this year, she, along with five other members of her village, formed a group named \u201cHara Gouri-1\u201d to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nLaxmi has decided to take a loan of 10,000 INR to purchase stock rice and paddy for preparation of puffed rice for a longer period. She hopes this will help her to increase her income and help her to manage her family better than the present status. Laxmi hopes to repair her house and give a better education to her only son. \r\n\r\nThe other five borrowers of the group are Guadei with a goatery business, Maharani with a vegetable cultivation and vending business, Suru with a milk and vegetable business, Kumari with a goatery and vegetable vending business, and Purnnami with a milk business. They have also decided to take a loan of 10,000 INR each for development of their existing businesses for the betterment of their families.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1446082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a stock of rice and paddy for preparation of puffed rice.

Subidha, a lady of 41 years, lives here with her husband and three sons of 26, 23 and 20 years, in a small mud house. The lady standing second from left with a raised hand in the photograph is Subidha. Her family belongs in the below-poverty-line category. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for Subhida\u2019s family is cultivation, which is seasonal only. Due to this situation, it was very difficult on her part to maintain her family. So, to add some extra income to her family, Subidha herself started a general store in her house twelve years ago. She started this business in a low profile with a small investment of her own. She sells general grocery items like oil, sugar, tea, soap, washing powder, lentils, biscuits, toffees, eggs, etc. She purchases stock for her business on a weekly basis from the wholesalers of the nearest town, ten kilometers away. After five years, she purchased a sewing machine, and her husband started a tailoring center. \r\n\r\nFrom the above two sources, she earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR (Indian rupees), which is not at all sufficient to manage her five-member family. To expand her business for more income, in the year 2013 she, along with three other members of her village, formed a group named \u201cHara Gouri-2\u201d to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nSubhida wants to increase the stock of her business with this loan amount of 10,000 INR by purchasing items like lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc. Subidha hopes this will help her to increase her income for materializing her dreams of construction of a house and the marriage of her sons.\r\n\r\nThe other three borrowers of the group are Lalita, Dharatri and Indra, doing milk and vegetable vending, bedsheet stitching, and milk selling businesses respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1446087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TIKRAPADA, BALANGIR,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dharatri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subidha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T20:14:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":616465,"name":"Clyde","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clyde is a natural businessperson.

Svetlana raised her children alone, with her own efforts and resources.  She is always working, she never just sits around doing nothing.  Svetlana has her own car, which she sometimes uses to earn a little extra money driving it as a taxi, but her primary business is in repairing and remodeling apartments and houses.  However, Svetlana herself lives in a house that has needed repairs for a long time, but she doesn't have the money to do this.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, Svelana took out a loan from MDO Arvand and started to do the repairs but she didn't finish because she didn't have enough money.  Now, she would like to finish the repairs so she can live in a normal, functional house.  And so, Svetlana has applied to MDO Arvand for another loan for the purchase of building materials for her home.  She is hoping for a favorable decision and would like to thank in advance MDO Arvand for its support.

kind-hearted and cheerful man of 39.  He was born and grew up in a rural area.  Beginning in his childhood, his father taught him how to farm and raise animals.  Now that Shokirdzhon has his own family of five children, he himself is in the business of farming and raising animals, since he has so much experience in this field.  He earns a good income from his business.  \r\n\r\nShokirdzhon started working with MDO Arvand in 2012 when he took out a loan for developing his business and he conscientiously repaid his loan.  Presently, he would like to expand his farming business by buying up a large amount of seed and fertilizers.  For this reason he applied to MDO Arvand wanting a loan to buy the seed and fertilizers.  Shokirdzhon is hoping for a positive decision and would like to thank in advance MDO Arvand for its support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1446902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seed and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-13T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-12T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shokirdzhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4530.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550198}],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T03:36:43Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":616583,"name":"Violeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Violeta is 39 years old and married with two children.

Thanks to her hard work, today Cholpon has 3 milking cows and 3 calves.  Her monthly income amounts to 10,000 somi (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Cholpon applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 somi (KGS) to buy heifers.

He is a husband to his wife, a father to his three sons and also a grandfather.  His wife works as a Russian language teacher at the local school in Bohtar.  His oldest son is working abroad, his second son is in the army, and his youngest son is married, has a child and lives with his parents.  Abdukakhor is 59 years old.  Until recently, he has been working in construction, however, this type of work has become too physically demanding for him.  Abdukakhor decided to start raising cattle in his yard.  He has already prepared the necessary space for this activity.  The only part left, is to buy calves and some feed for them.  His savings of 350 dollars are inadequate to cover the entire purchase.  Abdukakhor is asking for a loan to buy four young calves and feed.  Abdukakhor is hoping that he will have good luck and is hoping for your generosity."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1449816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To

Her eldest, the son, studies at the Khujand State University.  Her daughter is still in grade school.\r\n\r\nNodira and her husband must pay her son's university tuition now.  Their personal savings aren't enough to make the payment, so Nodira applied for a loan.  She promises to repay the loan on time using her income as a seamstress and the income from her husband's business.

He finished the second grade, and for about five years, he took classes at night. Ismael is married with one son, age 18. His wife is a homemaker, and his son works in agriculture. Ismael says that he has to provide for his wife and son.\r\n\r\nIsmael has worked in agriculture since he was ten years old. He learned to farm from his father, who used to bring him along to help with the oxen, the plough and planting crops, especially corn and beans. Ismael has 7,000 square meters of corn planted and 3,5000 square meters of beans. He also grows yucca on a plot of land by his home. Ismael says that he walks about ten minutes to reach his fields, and that he works from six to ten in the morning, and returns in the afternoon to keep an eye on the crops. \r\nAdditionally, Ismael buys a few baby chicks, which he later sells when they are fully grown to make money. \r\n\r\nIsmael is requesting this loan, which he says he needs urgently, to buy agricultural supplies to control infestations in his crops. He will use it to buy fertilizer and pesticides against maggots and flies, as well as leaf pesticide for his beans, which are infected with a fungus that is burning the leaves.

As a result of her hard work, today Shynarkul has 1 milking cow, 1 calf, 1 heifer, and 10 sheep.  Her monthly income amounts to 16,000 somi (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Shynarkul applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 somi (KGS) to buy a horse.

She is the mother of four children. Her husband owns a beauty salon, which is the only source of income for the family. His monthly net income is insufficient to pay the children's school fees, pay the electricity and gas bills and to meet the daily food needs and other expenses. He has to support his family as well. Presently, he is planning to grow his business. For that Shazia, as a member of a two-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of beautician products like lipstick, hair dryers, facial creams and makeup kits to work more professionally. With the amount of profit, he will put aside some savings amount and pay the electricity and gas bills. Shazia hopes that the loan will be helpful to her husband's business.

But he does not have sufficient funds to fix the problem.  Nazia requested a loan so that her husband would be able to maintain his auto rickshaw.  Now her husband feels tranquil and comfortable, because he has a regular income after repair.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan with Kiva.

She lives with her parents in a small village of Sighnaghi district, eastern Georgia. Her parents are provided with a retirement pension. The family has a small vineyard, and they produce wine to sell. \r\n\r\nIn the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living.  So, she decided to start a clothing-trading business with the loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Her credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShorena received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo - Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of GEL 500, she will purchase clothing at wholesale prices and sell it in her community door-to-door. \r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the job is hard for Shorena, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her trading business gradually. The Start Up credit will be a great support for her family, as its income will be significantly increased.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1446623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to begin selling clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Anaga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-10-13T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-12T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":32.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":36.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":37.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":38.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.52},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.23},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.96,"local_amount":32.25,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":34.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255625},{"amount":24.01,"local_amount":36.93,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":39.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019752},{"amount":24.42,"local_amount":37.57,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449670854},{"amount":25.13,"local_amount":38.67,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":41.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141468},{"amount":26.52,"local_amount":40.8,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":44.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467957190},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":40.99,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-24T08:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":44.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479177906},{"amount":27.59,"local_amount":42.45,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-02T09:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":45.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490872486},{"amount":149.72,"local_amount":230.34,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-21T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":248.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504299629}],"funded_date":"2013-10-14T12:57:42Z","paid_date":"2014-07-21T09:26:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":616662,"name":"Kousar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kousar is a 35-year-old woman.

","en":"Tahmina was born in 1981. She is a good and cheerful woman. Tahmina is married and raising four children. Tahmina has always lived in poverty, as her husband earned very little money. It was not enough to provide for the family, and Tahmina only worked with raising the children. \r\n\r\nEight months ago, Tahmina started working. She works at the airport as a cleaning lady.

Her husband works in a metal structures workshop. Roxana is currently studying high school through distance learning, every saturday going to the institute in person in order to finish her secondary education.\r\n\r\nShe owns a small shop and sells clothing. These are her only income generating activities, which she uses to help her husband with their home expenses. She decided to start with this business three years ago, and despite some hardship she has been able to maintain it throughout this time. She fell ill in the past and had to use her savings from her work to pay for the treatment. Her shop is at her home, and its opening hours are from 4 am to 9 pm.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be a great help to Roxana. She wants to craft artificial flowers because on the 2nd of November the Commemoration of All Faithful Departed is observed in her country. She makes all sorts of flowers for this date, but due to her previous illness she had no funds to invest in her business. This loan will help her to work on her artificial flower business.\r\n\r\nRoxana is a person with a desire to grow, which pushes her to want to finish her secondary education, and if everything goes according to plan, she will ask for a loan to continue with higher education, paying it with the income from her business. As a mother she thinks of her child, and she wishes to help her to be a honest and responsible person, as well as to succeed in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1450700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to make artificial flowers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-13T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-12T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana Beatr\u00edz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":37.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.47},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.32,"local_amount":37.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":37.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857054},{"amount":37.05,"local_amount":37.05,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":37.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505266},{"amount":39.09,"local_amount":39.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":39.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716347},{"amount":41.8,"local_amount":41.8,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":41.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621973},{"amount":56.45,"local_amount":56.45,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":56.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902473},{"amount":21.68,"local_amount":21.68,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":21.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215688},{"amount":94.83,"local_amount":94.83,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":94.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817073},{"amount":171.78,"local_amount":171.78,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":171.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242557}],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T16:55:15Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:10:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ken Arroyo Ohori","image":1171159}},{"id":618963,"name":"Ainura","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0439\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0435 39 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0410\u0439\u043d\u0443\u0440\u044b -
