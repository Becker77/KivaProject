This idea was triggered by the absence of veterinary shops and extension services in an area whose major domestic and economic practice is farming. The business has been doing well. He is currently carrying out some research in partnership with a local NGO, on the best farming practices in his region. \r\n\r\nSimon was introduced to the solar lanterns, which provide safe and bright lighting and come with a mobile charging function, by Brazafric green energy marketing team. Due to the recurring high cost and health risks associated with paraffin, which is the commonly used lighting fuel in the area, he saw an opportunity to increase his sales, and raise the living conditions of people in the community. \r\n\r\nSimon appreciates the benefits accruing from the use of solar lanterns, and with the Kiva financing option from Brazafric, he is seeking financing to purchase solar lanterns to stock and sell to the community.

Aracelly is applying for a loan to invest in repairing her tabletop sewing machine and to maintain other equipment she uses for dressmaking.  The equipment is deteriorating but this loan will allow Aracelly to offer better service and reduce production time. This will allow her to have more contracts and increase her income.

","en":"Claudia is 34 years old and a stylist, work she has done throughout her working life in different hairdressing salons.  Claudia started learning this trade when she was very young as her family were having financial difficulties and Claudia had fallen pregnant at 14.  Because of this Claudia needed a job in order to earn an income to pay for the baby and support the family's finances.  After starting beautician classes at a local institute, Claudia found work in a hairdressing salon and, later, did further training and specialisations, increasing her knowledge and opening up the path to more possibilities in the working world.  After working as an employee for a number of years, Claudia decided to go it alone and started to offer her services, going round to her customers' homes.  Her determination and enterprising spirit, and her desire to do better, have led Claudia to look for opportunities to get ahead.  So, she is applying for her fifth loan, which she will use to buy fixed assets (mirrors, display cases), and supplies and merchandise in bulk (dyes, shampoo, hair treatments, hair accessories); she will also make improvements to her premises.  All this will allow Claudia's business to grow as she wants to start her own beauty salon in her home.  There she will provide service to her customers, who will be more comfortable. All of this will result in an increase in sales, which she can use to continue supporting the family finances.

She completes this work from her home where she has help from her parents. The income that she earns contributes to household expenses. She learned this skill in an empirical manner, using trial and error until she got good results. Her primary challenge is the competition in this sector because there are many people with similar businesses. However, this doesn't stop her from advancing. Her enterprising attitude and her desire to improve led her to request a loan to buy wholesale products such as vegetables, meat, cooking oil, and sauces, and to replace fixed assets including a deep-fryer and a grill.

Currently, she makes a living working in her own business, a shop that sells fried foods that she herself prepares. She prepares them in her home and sells them in public on the street. She began this activity empirically, only with the intention of generating an income to support her husband in the economic burden of their home. \r\n\r\nShe is a thriving, dedicated, and tenacious woman.  Day to day, she faces the different risks to which she is exposed on the street with her only goal being to safeguard the wellbeing of her children, who are her main motivation for continuing ahead. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the support of the loan to purchase kitchen utensils (pots, pans, spoons, knives) and to purchase supplies wholesale (vegetables, meat, chicken, flour, salsas).

She is a responsible mother and living happily in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. This is her first loan with the BRAC. She is a new member, but she has agreed with the terms and condition of BRAC.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to an ultra-poor family, and it is very difficult for her to pay all the household expenses with the low income. Her husband owns a scrap shop and deals with scrap iron, aluminum, plastic bottles, etc. He has been running his business for many years, his shop situated near his home. The reason for their poverty is the selection of a low turn-over business.\r\n\r\nHer husband had to spend his savings because of an accident, and now he does not have the amount to buy scrap goods. Therefore, Ghazala requested a loan for passing along to her husband, so that he could buy scrap iron, re-establish his enterprise, and make some savings to meet sudden needs or incidents. Ghazala is very impressed with this honorable support and shows her wish to take a huge loan, after this loan. She says \"thank you,\" to the Kiva and to its field partner, BRAC

40-year-old Fatmata, from Tombo, in the Western Area Rural District, near Freetown. She is married and has three children, aged 5 to 14 years. Two of her children are going to school. After the war, Fatmata established her wax print cotton business. She began her business because she was a housewife, but she needed to create income to support the household. She works at the business 10 hours per day, and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is a lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to buy more wax print cotton for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her standard of living. In the future, Fatmata plans to own a big shop. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1446835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She belongs to a happy family because her son earns sufficient income to meet daily household expenses. \r\n\r\nHer son has been running a generator-repair workshop for many years in a nearby town. He is very professional and experienced in his work. As we know, there are lots of problems due to load shedding of electricity, so most of the people like to use a generator to generate the electricity. Due to heavy usage, most of its parts become out of order. This is the reason her son has so many customers for generator repairing. \r\n\r\nHer son is very hard-working and honest; he asks very low services charges against his services. That is why people like to repair their generators from him. \r\n\r\nHer son wants to buy spare parts for generators and tools for generator repair, but he does not have sufficient savings to spend for purchases because recently he spent his savings for an emergency need.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Shehnaz has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her son will be able to buy his desired spare parts and tools for repairing. \r\n\r\nShehnaz hopes that through all this purchasing, customers will be attracted toward his shop, which would led to an increase in income and savings.\r\n\r\nShehnaz has praises for the lenders and is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner, BRAC

","en":"Istat is a 27-year-old resident of Konibodom.  She is raising two children on her own since her husband isn't in the country.  He is currently a migrant worker in Russia as he was unable to find suitable work in his own area.  Istat has worked for the last two years in her aunt's store.  She buys inventory herself, and then resells it.  Istat mostly focuses on selling women's shoes and clothing.  In preparation for the upcoming winter, Istat is taking out a loan to buy a collection of fall and winter clothing and shoes for women.  She understands how hard it is for children at this time and she tries to give them everything.  She feels that the welfare of her family depends on her income and therefore she works very hard.

Now, she wants to start her own business.  She would like to start buying and selling cattle.  She is a goal-oriented and positive person.  In her yard, Shamigul has built a barn out of mud walls and has supplied it with electricity so the animals will have light and warmth in the winter.

Her residence is in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\n\r\nSobia's husband earns a sufficient amount to easily afford the household expenses and the school fees of his children. He transports all kinds of goods, clothing and food items from one place to another within the city. He enters into a contract, hires a vehicle according to the volume of goods, and delivers them to their destination.\r\n\r\nRecently he got a contract to deliver goods to another city, but he does not have the money to hire a vehicle because of the higher fare demanded. Therefore, Sobia is requesting a loan for that purpose. She is very hopeful that Kiva lenders will support her request.\r\n\r\nSobia is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

She started her own business of clothing sales four years ago when her husband got severely ill. She didn\u2019t lose hope and contacted Kashf Foundation upon the advice of her neighbor to initiate her own business. \r\n\r\nShe buys clothes of different designs from the market in bulk at lower rates and then sells them in her community at a profit.

She has been running a business with her husband selling milk for the past 15 years. She has two buffaloes and one cow with milk and she sells their milk to many of her neighbors, along with butter and cheese that she makes from the milk. Suraya looks after the buffaloes and performs the task of collecting milk from them while her husband sells it to different places on a daily basis.

For the past five years she has been operating a cook shop (restaurant) selling rice and soup in the community market. She started this business with help from her husband, who works as a driver, and learned this way of selling from her mother. Kumba sells for 12 hours each day in a week. She uses a taxi most of the time to get her stock to her shop. She enjoys the flow of customers. She is requesting a loan to buy more fish, pepper, oil, onions, vita, rice, meat, etc. to increase her sales. She wants to get more money to educate her children and build a house.

Razmik, with the help of his family members, is engaged in breeding livestock such as cows, sheep, pigs, piglets, and hens and in the cultivation of alfalfa. Farming is the most important source of income for the family. As life is getting more expensive day by day, Razmik wants to enlarge the livestock to be able to cover the growing needs of his big family.

Meerimgul has a high school education.  The main source of income for her family is raising of livestock, which she started 7 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 4,000 KGS.  Thanks to the Meerimgul's persistent work, she now has one milking cow, two horses and six sheep.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.  \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Meerimgul applied to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to purchase heifers for breeding.  Part of the profits from her business, Meerimgul is planning to re-invest into purchasing additional cattle, and save the rest to eventually purchase a

However, thanks to his hard work during the recent times, Volodya was able to run his business in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

Her favorite part about her business is that she earns a living which enables her to take care of her children.

The loan will be used to purchase more timber to sell, which will help Sam generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children.

The loan will be used to purchase more drinks, such as soda and beer, to sell, which will help Pascol generate greater profits, and pay school fees for his children. Pascol hopes that in the future, he will be able to expand the business into a whole sell shop. \r\n\r\nPascol is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She learned her trade through observation and thought it would be a good opportunity for a profitable business.  She set up her own sewing shop with the help of her husband who works as a teacher.  With a previous loan she was able to buy her first sewing machine and started her activity little by little.  Thanks to her daily efforts she has been able to improve her technique and skill.\r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting her second loan to buy an overlock sewing machine and wholesale supplies (fabrics, threads, buttons, snaps) so she can improve her work conditions and cut back on production time.  This will increase her efficiency, sales volume and income so she can continue contributing to the household economy and strive toward her goal of expanding busines and becoming a fabric and dressmaking wholesale dealer.   Erika is conscious that in order to meet her goals she must work with discipline, dedication and drive because it is the only way she and her husband will have a quality lifestyle.

se iban del pa\u00eds, por lo que Jos\u00e9 convenci\u00f3 a sus padres para tomar esta casa y as\u00ed \u00e9l podr\u00eda continuar con la tienda, de esta forma ha logrado generar los recursos

Trabaja muy juicioso todos los d\u00edas de la semana desde las 8:00 am hasta las 9:30 pm, pero en los horarios que tiene clases, su madre o su hermano menor le colaboran atendiendo a los clientes. \u00c9l ve en esta actividad una gran fuente de ingresos y un negocio muy rentable, pues es consciente de que los productos de la canasta familiar se venden a diario. Actualmente solicita el apoyo del cr\u00e9dito para realizar mejoras locativas (arreglar carpa exterior y una banca) y para comprar surtido al por mayor (mecato, l\u00e1cteos, huevos, granos, galleter\u00eda, productos de aseo, entre otros), de esta forma su negocio tendr\u00e1 una mejor imagen y adem\u00e1s podr\u00e1 abastecerse de productos de diferentes marcas para satisfacer las necesidades de sus clientes, mejorando notablemente sus ventas y los ingresos que recibe de ellas. Jos\u00e9 con su esp\u00edritu de superaci\u00f3n, desea seguir trabajando arduamente para sacar adelante su negocio, fortalecerlo y hacerlo crecer hasta convertirlo en un minimercado, que sea m\u00e1s rentable y que le permita ejercer sus profesi\u00f3n en su negocio; de esta manera desea mejorar la calidad de vida de la familia y terminar sus estudios universitarios.","en":"Jos\u00e9, 21, is a dynamic young entrepreneur who has his own business, a grocery store, which he started a year ago.  His parents were friends of the owners who rented out the property because they were leaving the country.  Jos\u00e9 convinced his parents to rent the house so he could set up a store and earn enough income to support the household economy and pay for university studies.  He works every day from 8:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.  During class time his mother or younger brother help at the store attending to customers.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 believes this business is a good source of income and very profitable because families need to buy things on a daily basis.  He is requesting a loan to improve the store (fixing the outdoor awning and a bench) and to buy wholesale merchandise (cakes, dairy products, eggs, grains, cookies, personal hygiene products, etc.).  This will give his business a better image and allow him to have on hand different brands of products to satisfy customer demand.   Sales and income will improve considerably.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's determination to get ahead and continue working hard to strengthen his business and make it grow will allow him to turn it into a profitable mini-market where he can use his professsional knowledge.

Due to financial difficulties and a lack of work opportunities, he decided to start his own business and began to sell fruit from a cart.

His drive, hard work and dedication have allowed him to get ahead, overcoming different obstacles, especially financial ones. They haven't stopped him from continuing to fight to achieve his goals. Right now, he is asking for the loan to invest in paying off an existing loan that he has and to buy merchandise wholesale (fruit in season). This way, he can lower costs and improve his profit margin from selling the fruit. Miguel dreams of continuing to work hard and save so that in the near future he can open another fruit sales locale an offer a job opportunity to a relative.

She lives in Jemaga village in Galona, Kenya. Jemaga village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from an unprotected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Nancy and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nNancy works as a peasant farmer, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Nancy and other promoters in her community - Everlyne, Paulo and Solomon, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Nancy will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. She wants to be a promoter because she believes the program will help prevent waterborne diseases. Nancy believes that the dispenser will help her community prevent sickness and access safe water.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.  Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Nancy\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-10-14T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-13T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-14T16:30:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":617085,"name":"Tenneh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tanneh is a 36-year-old woman and lives at the West point area which has the most populated market in the Montserrado County.

for a new chlorine dispenser. 42 year old Florence has some primary school education. She lives in house with mud walls, a dirt floor, and an iron roof with her husband and 7 children. \n\nMuseywa village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink.\n\nFlorence and the 14 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a chlorine dispenser at the water sources. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Jimin, Damaris, Phanice and Mary. \n\nFlorence has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. She volunteered to be the promoter because she is well-liked and is reliable. She believes the chlorine dispenser will ensure the community has good health.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Florence\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-10-14T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-13T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jimin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damaris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phanice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-16T16:49:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":615764,"name":"Gladys' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys is 57 years old and has 3 children.

Rose and the 21 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nRose has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. She volunteered to be the promoter because the community will be able to access safe water through the chlorine dispenser. The dispenser will prevent waterborne diseases. There are three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Ezina, Josphine, and Jane.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Rose\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Mary and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nMary works as a subsistence farmer growing food crops, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Mary and other promoters (including: Joyce, Gladys, Benson, and Lucy) in her community need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Mary will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Mary wants to be a promoter because she is readily available and willing to serve the community. Mary believes that the dispenser will provide chlorine which helps to prevent illnesses like diarrhea and other waterborne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Mary\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1449235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-10-14T10:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-13T10:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T19:04:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":617127,"name":"William's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Simbi village in Gimarakwa, Kenya, William has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser.

She has completed her primary school education and is currently working as a maize farmer. Linda is also very active in her community's women's group. The community of Sheveye village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Sheveye\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Sheveye, 10 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water.  Linda has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.  She is known in the community as being friendly and has volunteered because she loves her people. Someone in Linda's family has suffered from a water borne disease in the past so she believes that the chlorine will help kill germs in their drinking water. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Linda, Phyllip, Barris, Abel, and Iren.\n\nSheveye village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Linda\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1449027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers.

His hard work has paid off--Delton has become very well known in the community for providing quality service.\r\n\r\nNow, Delton has reached a point where he needs to hire additional help to ensure the quality of customer service with which he built the foundation of his business. With this loan, Delton will hire an employee to keep up with the demand.

It was shortly thereafter that Naimah discovered that two of her children had learning disabilities. In an effort to help them, she spent two summers in New York City learning the Spalding Reading method in order to teach her children how to read. She realized she had a knack for teaching and began teaching both children and adults how to read, meeting them in their homes and at local fast food establishments.\r\n\r\nThrough hard work and dedication, Naimah obtained an AS in Small Business Management and was pursuing a BA in General Business. However, Naimah endured another setback when she was diagnosed with carpal tunnel and fibromyalgia. \"The doctor suggested I change my lifestyle, so I did. I quit a high-paying job at a utility company and started my life all over again,\" she says. It was after this setback that Naimah returned to teaching. She obtained her Masters in elementary curriculums, certificate in graduate studies in early childhood, and a Master's in adult learning. It was after this that she launched Babbling Brook Family Tutoring Services (BBFTS).\r\n\r\nBBFTS will offer after-school programs as well as general services for those who want to improve their grammar and conversational skills. Clients will be students age 14 and up and the Spanish speaking population in the East Boston area, where the business is located. Lessons will be offered in group classes, as well as one on one consultation. Naimah has two partners in her business--a woman who speaks Spanish and a her youngest daughter who serves as her accountant and bookkeeper. \r\n\r\nNaimah is looking for capital to cover the lease for her learning center and to purchase advertising in order to promote her business.\r\n\r\nHelp Naimah help others with your

She is a noble farmer dedicated to raising pigs, which she buys and sells at commercial markets of the Kampong Thom province. Aside from raising hogs, she decided to do other things that would help her to improve her income like growing rice and selling dessert. Involved in three businesses at the same time, she seems to have a busy life to provide a better quality of life for her children, who also serve as her motivation in the family-owned businesses.\r\n\r\nKhek wants to acquire a loan in the sum of 1,000 US dollars to buy a motorcycle for her son to commute to his workplace.

Margarita's work is renting out a taxicab. She has a vehicle she bought many years ago. Each day, a driver arrives at her house and is responsible for a route through the main streets of the city. She receives a small amount from renting her car everyday that helps to cover some needs in her home. She has carried out this activity for 8 years, since she was able to purchase a taxi in the public service after much effort and a constant struggle in her previous job. Her previous job was sewing which she had to stop performing because of health reasons. Currently, she sees the possibility of entering the laundry business because she believes it is a very profitable job. In the area where she lives, there are people who have high-pressure jobs who do not have time to do their laundry and have requested this service. She is waiting to buy a washing machine in the near future. For the moment, she likes to rent her taxi because it allows her to spend her free time caring for her children and perform other jobs to eventually improve her family's income and improve their standard of living. Now she feels at peace regarding all that she is pursuing and hopes in the future to consolidate a formal company in both jobs that she undertakes. This is her 6th loan with Kiva and she is very happy to know she has financial support that allows her to continue with her work. With the amount requested of 2,000 soles, she will change a few tires in her cab and buy some parts it needs for proper functioning as well as invest in the purchase of a washer to engage in this business.
