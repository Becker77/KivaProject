But this stroke of fate has not broken him, and to this day he continues to live and be happy for other people. Orifdzhon is a very hardworking man who lives with his parents and, in order to not be fully dependent on them, runs his own business. He sells CDs at the local market, for which he has a small stall. He receives good earnings from this business and is able to help his parents cover living costs. But as insurance for the future, he needs to expand his business. He didn't have enough of his own capital to attain his dreams of business expansion, and has turned to Arvand for a loan. Orifdzhon would like a loan to purchase various high-quality CDs for further resale.

He is a hardworking, kindhearted man of 26 who loves nature and spent his whole childhood in agricultural areas. Ikromjon is married and has two beautiful children. His wife is a homemaker and takes care of the children, while his occupation is buying and selling rice. He takes rice from the village and distributes it around the region. At the same time, he works as a taxi driver, using his own private vehicle. Ikromjon tries with all his might to ensure his family has enough, since he is the only earner in the family. Because of this he has decided to begin yet another business, buying, fattening and selling small-horned cattle. He already has a few heads of cattle, but he would like to increase the number and has therefore turned to Arvand for a loan.

This will improve her profits for her family and she'll be able to fulfill her children's dreams and continue supporting them in their studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1451532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-14T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-13T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma Marleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1425,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":29141.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082658}],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T00:57:42Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":617363,"name":"Luisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luisa is a 63-year-old married woman with 3 children.

Unfortunately because of the lack of economic resources and the poverty in which she lives she was not able to finish her schooling as it was necessary to work at a young age to help with the household expenses. Thanks to her efforts and desire to succeed she has been able to support her daughters with the small grocery store located in her home, from which she sells consumer goods for the home such as: rice, beans, sugar, candy, detergent, clothing, shoes, cosmetics, clothing, bread, eggs, coffee, fruit, and other items. Juan opens her business very early and closes late, thus providing the best service to her customers. One of her dreams is being able to continue building her house, expanding it in order to have two separate businesses. The objective of this loan is to invest in her store, buying general merchandise as the demand has increased. Juana is very thankful for the support that Kiva investors offer to people of few economic resources."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1451542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy consumer goods such as rice, detergent, clothing for children and adults, cosmetics, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-10-15T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-14T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana De La Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2200},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.56,"local_amount":2201.6,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2237.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545919},{"amount":88.29,"local_amount":2219.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2256.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199668},{"amount":88.33,"local_amount":2220.99,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2257.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449669043},{"amount":88.24,"local_amount":2218.69,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2255.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459139681},{"amount":87.14,"local_amount":2191.04,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2226.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955441},{"amount":87.15,"local_amount":2191.1,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2227.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176212},{"amount":87.9,"local_amount":2210.09,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2246.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490870875},{"amount":260.39,"local_amount":6546.7,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6653.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298146}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T16:12:46Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:15:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":617369,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 28-year-old married father of two children who has been selling perfumes, toys, and accessories in his shop since a year and a half ago.

The loan will be used to purchase more spare parts to sell, and will help Charlse to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children. He hopes that in the future he will be able to have a bigger business. \r\n\r\nCharlse is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Charlse who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1447493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare

Catalina has worked in agriculture for more than 30 years on a plot of 1.5 hectares that she acquired when she was very young. She was helped by the father of her children with the objective of using it as the principle source of income, cultivating the most commercial products in her region like cocoa, citrus fruits, and coffee, among others. \r\n\r\nWhen she started she achieved performing the work with much dedication and responsibility, since it was a profession that her parents instilled in her since she was a child. One of her principle problems when she started this work was that she was already the mother of her first son, and she had to do the agricultural work with her baby on her back. Her work consists of dedicating the best of care and maintenance to her fields since it is an indispensable requirement for obtaining a harvest with commercial value, making this activity profitable.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a good harvest she usually fertilizes her land with organic fertilizer. She really likes to participate in the harvesting where it is necessary to contract local workers in order to reduce the workload, and making this task a collective and enjoyable task.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva and she feels thankful for the financial support that she is receiving to move forward.

They all live together in their own home made of good materials.

She works every day, usually missing out on a lot of activities on Sundays and festival days since farming is a business that requires a lot of dedication and responsibility.  She has the firm support of her husband and also sometimes of the workers in the area for collective jobs, like weeding and harvesting.  She always tries to keep her lands properly maintained, since this ultimately results in high quality commercial fruits.  She also gets these results from fertilizing her crops with organic fertilizer.\r\n\r\nOne of her main goals is to grow her production of organic cocoa, a product that presents an increase in commercial value and that is considered to be one of the most easy to fertilize.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva, and Cynthia feels thankful for the financial support that she receives in order to continue moving forward.

She is divorced and has two children (Alexander, 16, and Kevin, 9) that live with her in a house her ex-husband left her. The biggest challenge she has had to face was the divorce, since her husband was who covered the home expenses. She then had to look for a job, which was difficult at the beginning because it was difficult to find someone to take care of her children. Laura started working with one of her sisters, raising chickens.\r\n\r\nLaura has given her children unconditional support, since their father has not supported them for a long time. Laura works today raising and selling chickens, which she keeps in small pens. She learned this activity from her sister, who has been helping her for a while now. Besides poultry, she also sells beauty products on a catalog. The most difficult part for her is to find transport for her chickens; she spends a lot of money in transport.\r\n\r\nHer dream and wish is to give her children a good education and a better quality of life, so that they can have everything they need in the future.

le ha sido un poco m\u00e1s complicado ya que su esposa era su apoyo econ\u00f3mico, pese a todo esto C\u00e9sar ha tenido que luchar y salir adelante solo, ahora cuenta con el apoyo de su familia, a C\u00e9sar le gusta mucho hacer deporte ya que esto le ayuda a mantenerse sano y por un momento olvida su dolor, C\u00e9sar se dedica desde hace algunos a\u00f1os a la crianza  y venta de pollos, y adem\u00e1s para solventar sus gastos y cumplir con las obligaciones con sus hijos es maestro pintor de casas, habilidad que la aprendi\u00f3 desde muy peque\u00f1o ya que su padre y t\u00edos practicaban esta actividad. \nTrabaja desde muy temprano en la ma\u00f1ana cuidando de sus aves para luego salir a la ciudad a trabajar pintando casas, a pesar de lo duro que es el cuidado de las aves y el tiempo que le lleva el trabajo, C\u00e9sar se da el tiempo necesario para compartir con sus hijos por lo menos un fin de semana. \nC\u00e9sar tiene un sue\u00f1o muy grande e importante en su

","en":"C\u00e9sar was born in the city of Latacunga in the Sant\u00e1n community. He lives with his relatives as he separated from his wife a while ago. Without a doubt, this sad separation has been the biggest hurdle he has had to overcome in his life. From that moment on, everything has been a bit more difficult for him since his wife supported him financially.  In spite of everything, C\u00e9sar has had to fight to keep going on alone, but now he has the support of his family. C\u00e9sar likes to play sport a lot, as this helps to keep him healthy and to momentarily forget his pain. \r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar has been raising and selling chickens for years. As well as that, in order to pay his bills and fulfill his financial obligations to his children, he is also an expert house painter, having learnt this skill when he was young from his father and uncles, who also used to be painters.\r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar works from very early in the morning caring for his birds and later goes into the city to work painting houses. Even though it is difficult to care for the birds as well as spending time working, C\u00e9sar makes sure he has enough time for his children, at least on weekends.\r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar has a very big and important life dream, and that is to have his own house which he can share with his children. He needs this loan to build a shed for his chickens as they only have very basic lodgings at the moment.

Gonzalo is very good at this and also works as an advisor in cultural institutions between four and five hours.  Throughout his career he has produced five CDs of his own and has received recognition from a few companies and institutions, as well as some personal ones.  He is asking for a loan to be able to produce his seventh CD.\r\n\r\nHis biggest dream is to be able to see his son again and be with him.

Her house is located near the university and several students have already expressed an interest in living there, but she has been unable to get a loan from several local financial institutions to pay for renovations. That is why she is requesting a loan from Kiva and Credo, which help people who do not qualify for conventional loans. \r\n\r\nZhuzhuna will use the loan to buy the materials she needs to renovate her house.

She lives in her own house which she managed to build with much effort and sacrifice 20 years ago.  She has three adult children that no longer live with her.\r\n\r\nShe learned agriculture from her parents while still a young girl and has had to work from sun to sun because the economic situation was never good.  They had to suffer many needs and her parents never sent her to school so to this day Tr\u00e1nsito is illiterate.  Because of this, legal, banking or personal transactions have always been difficult and she\u2019s had to rely on her son who has a power of attorney from her to represent her in any transaction.\r\n\r\nTr\u00e1nsito\u2019s business for more than 20 years has been buying and selling cattle and small animals.  This activity has made it possible for her to get ahead with her children.  She\u2019s very well-known in her community for being a hardworking woman.\r\n\r\nAt present, Tr\u00e1nsito is in poor health and it\u2019s been difficult for her to go out to transport her animals from one place to another which has led her to have to stay home caring for her small animals like chickens, guinea pigs, sheep and pigs.  \r\n\r\nShe visited Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to request a loan to buy a dairy cow that will generate higher profits but above all will allow her to stop having to go to various market places.  \r\n\r\nTr\u00e1nsito wants to extend a sincere thanks and

For the past four years, Sarah has been working hard to manage her mini-supermarket, which sells essential items like bread and milk. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. This loan will be used to buy more commodities to sell in the supermarket and will help Sarah generate greater profits and meet some of her family's basic needs. Sarah hopes that, in the future, she will be able to expand the business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program.

The income that she gathers helps her and her husband to cover her family's basic needs.\r\n \r\nNow, for purchasing new stock of supplies, this hardworking woman has no financial means. So, she is asking for this loan to be able to purchase new stock of cosmetics to sell to her customers. \r\n\r\nSerine has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

He makes bricks in Ruyonza Local Cell 1 and he hopes to use the loan money of two million shillings to buy firewood, which he will use to bake the bricks he makes. His clients are mainly the builders and the general population who use bricks for construction purposes. His main challenge is rain which sometimes hits and damages his bricks before they dry hence causing him a shortage. Apart from brick making, David also sells timber which gives him additional income to support his family.

Working seven days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about Le 750,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Chernor has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan in order to buy: dozens of sardines-1,000,000, carton of batteries-1,000,000, carton of Peak milk-500,000.

is 28-year-old Seibatu. She is married and has two children aged 8 and 5. In 2008, Seibatu established her clothing and textiles business. She began her business just to support her children's education as a single parent. Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are mostly women. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Seibatu has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy dozens of brazian [hair extensions] for Le 700,000, pieces of wax cotton for Le 2,000,000 and dozens of baby clothes for Le 1,000,000.

So, with this loan Artsvik wants to purchase a computer, printer and chairs for providing individual lessons, which will greatly assist her classes and will make them more effective.\r\nArtsvik has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.
