In the short term, he hopes to increase his business and with this to be able to continue supporting his family so that they have better opportunities in life.\r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras \u2013 September  2013\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1452047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy iron, a blowtorch, clamps, a square, etc., for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noel Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429614502},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840925},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449730798},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459210131},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468035155},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T19:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479253353},{"amount":100,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504388270}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T16:57:44Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T17:20:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":617739,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda is a hard-working entrepreneur who has a fishing\/fish vending business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 6,000 through NWTF to buy additional fishing nets and other fishing materials for her business.\r\n\r\nRosalinda has been in this business for 30 years.

She has lived with relatives for 6 years. Through the sacrifice of her parents, she was able to finish her secondary school studies. The greatest obstacle in her life has been that the father of her children is not with them. In spite of this, Lorena has not skimped on sacrificing and dedicating herself 100% to her children and giving them the best that she is capable of. She sells clothing, perfumes, and cosmetics. This has allowed her to raise her children. She has additional income, since the father of her children gives her a small allowance for the support of the little ones. Lorena is a hard-working young woman, entrepreneurial and very responsible for raising and educating her children. For this reason, Lorena never gives up and looks for the way to persist.\r\n\r\nSince she was very young, she has worked with her mother, who prepares and sells typical food. In her business, she works all afternoon to sell her products, visit customers, and carry out collection activities. In the morning, she cares for her little daughter and tends to her home, doing various domestic chores. Lorena buys and sells beauty products by catalog, a business that she learned from her sister-in-law, who offered her all her support from the beginning, and since then she has had a great response to her products. She has prospective customers in the public and private institutions of the city, and she is very well known for her charisma and friendliness in selling her products. The loan that she is applying for is to purchase merchandise that she can keep in stock to offer her customers for the Christmas season, when the sales are very good, with great response to the promotions that are offered. This will help her to improve her income and profits. \r\n\r\nLorena wants to extend sincere appreciation and greetings to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making possible the growth of her working and personal life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1452051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy products to sell for the Christmas season.

Todos los d\u00edas, se dirige muy temprano a su peque\u00f1o taller en la ciudad a 4 kil\u00f3metros de su casa y llega por las tardes, cuando tiene mucho trabajo lo lleva para su casa y tiene que desvelarse toda la noche, para salir con el tiempo con los pedidos que le solicitan. \n\nLos fondos del cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1n utilizados, para construir las paredes a la champa donde a instalado la tienda de su esposa.  Actualmente, ella solo saca una parte de la mercader\u00eda y la otra la deja al interior de la casa, por que es muy peque\u00f1o el espacio en donde esta ubicada la tienda. \n\n\u00c9l espera para el futuro,  expandirse en su peque\u00f1o taller de joyer\u00eda, instalar otro taller en diferente lugar para ayudar con mejores ingresos a su familia, y espera darles el estudio a sus hijos si es posible hasta la universidad.","en":"Oscar is 35 years old. With much effort, his parents were able to give him an education with a technical degree. Later he had to work on his own i agriculture and other daily activities that helped him bring in income for his family. His wife has a small store in their house and with it she helps pay for the family expenses. His two children are in primary school and another is in eighth grade. \r\n\r\nOscar has a little jewelry store with a relative in the city. With a lot of hard work and perseverance, he was able to open it. He learned this activity about 10 years ago. A friend who did this activity taught him and he had to pay to learn the profession. In addition, when he has little work he works as a bricklayer, since his father taught him that activity. Weekends he is a collector for a bus that goes through the communities close to where he lives. Every day he goes out very early to his little workshop in the city 4 kilometers from his house and he comes back in the afternoon. When he has a lot of work he takes it home and has to stay up all night so he can get out on time with the orders.  \r\n\r\nThe money from the loan will be used to t build walls on his wife's store. Right now, she just takes out some of the merchandise and leaves the rest inside the house because he space where she has the store is very small. \r\n\r\nHe hopes that in the future he can expand his little jewelry store, setting up another store somewhere else to help with the family income. He hopes to give his children an education, if possible, a college education.

He has worked in farming since he was 11 years old. He learned the trade from his uncle who raised him because his parents did not take care of him. He never went to school as he needed to work to survive. He currently sows 14,000m2 of corn, and he sells the cobs. The corn is produced using an irrigation system in order to obtain four harvests per year.  To carry out the irrigation, he has to install the pipes in every single furrow and to water a 7000m2 area takes two days. To buy his supplies, Antonio takes the local bus to the city, 30 minutes ride away. He is requesting $500 to buy six bags of fertilizer and other supplies to sow 10,500m2 of corn. With the money from the loan, he will only need to make one trip to buy the supplies, and this will save him time and money as they will charge him less for buying in bulk. Once he has all the supplies, Antonio will be able to take better care of his crops and obtain a more abundant harvest. His income will increase allowing him to pay back the loan and put food on the table for his family. Antonio dreams of having three dairy cows to have an extra source of income and food for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1452073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy six bags of fertilizer and other supplies to sow a 10,500m2 area of corn on irrigated land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T06:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716647}],"funded_date":"2013-10-16T15:35:43Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":617780,"name":"Claudio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Claudio is 43 years old and married with three children.

I am interested in European history, history of European culture, European literature, and multicultural European society, the rights of the European Union and European languages. I am very interested in European Studies, both on a national and international level, and am determined to promote positive change in my country and region. I am convinced that completion of my studies at the American University of Central Asia will provide me with the capacity to do so. \r\nAUCA provides the best quality education among Central Asian universities with two diplomas, both Kyrgyz state and Bard college diplomas. Another important point is that I have a high regard for AUCA's liberal arts program as every course is worthy of a bachelor degree. The academic environment at AUCA is welcoming and has responsive instructors who are highly experienced. Studying in the Preparatory Program already gave me the chance to prepare myself for further study at AUCA by improving my English speaking and grammar and most importantly writing skills with the support of my instructors in the Preparatory Program. \r\nAUCA also provides students with the facilities required for learning and I am sure higher education at this unique university will lead me toward success and a bright future. As a result, according to my academic achievements, personal qualities and social work, I will be able to be a promising student of the AUCA. My previous academic achievements and active participation at my school\u2019s extracurricular activities are examples of my interest in Europe.\r\nStudying at the Preparatory Program made me more enthusiastic to study at AUCA and I know that AUCA is the right place for me.  I chose to study at AUCA in order to have a successful future not only for me and my family but also for my community and country. I am certain that through pursuing my career I can move towards the achievements of my long standing goals of my country\u2019s political, social and economic improvement. And studying at the European Studies Department at AUCA will support me to reach my aims and ambitions. It will also provide the chance and prospect for the fulfillment of aspirations of a Kyrgyz girl who is looking ahead with immense sense of hope for a bright future to be part of the modernization and advancement of my beloved country.\r\nBut unfortunately my family is not able to afford the full tuition at AUCA.

She opened her business in 1986 in Iraq. At the time training institutions were only available in Baghdad where she completed her studies and since continued to participate in various trainings to stay up to date with new techniques. She understands the need and finds it important to provide her customers with the best services.\n\nAt work as a business woman she has been able to grow her business and employ 3 women; at home as a mother she been a role mother to her two daughters. Both of her daughters are following in her footsteps; one of them is currently working with her while the other has already been able to open her own salon with help from Shlair.   \n\nAs she explains with her own words in the video: \u201cMy name is Shlair, I am the owner of the salon. I have been working in this field for 28 years after attending some training courses in Baghdad at the Fluna Institute for Beauty. I also went to Jordan for attending an exhibition for Beauty Salon owners and I also worked in Turkey for a little while. I feel happy to work in this field, earn money for my daily life, and I\u2019m proud to have two daughters who have already made their certifications as well. And I plan to expand this beauty shop.\u201d  \n\nShe enjoys working with her customers and is happy for having been able to open and maintain a reputable salon. To ensure the salon continues to provide high level services, Shlair decided to take a SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount of $10,000. She would like to update the style of the salon, most importantly to buy new special chairs for both the hairdressing works and for the beautician\u2019s corner. As she explains, the current chairs are very old, hard to work with and one of them is completely out of order with a broken system. She will also use the loan to purchase additional high quality cosmetics and supplies, and based on her customers' requests, she would also like to buy certain items for retail in the shop and this way help her customers gain access to products unavailable in other shops.  \n\nAfter the upgrade of the salon is complete, Shlair\u2019s long term goal is to establish her salon as a teaching institute for other aspiring women interested to work in the field."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1431454,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2883,"youtubeId":"4UNA_b2yxQ4","title":"Kiva Borrower Shlair from Iraq","thumbnailImageId":1432083},"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":["SME","Growing Businesses"],"use":"to update the style of the salon, most importantly buy new special chairs and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":10000,"lender_count":307,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shlair","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":10000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":837},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":837},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":3336,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T10:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3336,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429948241},{"amount":833,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":833,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449731560},{"amount":1666,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1666,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459210940},{"amount":833,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":833,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479254181},{"amount":833,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":833,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490950528},{"amount":833,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":833,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504389208},{"amount":1666,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1666,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517666270}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T23:09:36Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T16:13:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":608721,"name":"Shireen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Experiencing first hand a community level problem effecting many families, Shireen turned a personal need into an enterprise.  \n\nIn 2003, working as a teacher herself, Shireen had work commitments until 5pm but was unable to find day care for her young child. The few government provided facilities were inadequate, crowded and would only be open until 1pm \u2013 leaving many families in deadlock when choosing between mothers working or staying at home.\n\nWith very little money, no support, and many challenges Shireen took matters into her own hands and decided to open a private kindergarten and day care center. While many people would not believe in her potential for success and commented the opening with sour words, she had proved them wrong. The small endeavor had since outgrown its original location and since 2009 operates from 3 small locations \u2013 one of which is shown on the pictures.\n\nShireen now has 10 years experience with managing kindergartens, and 19 years experience as a teacher. She is a mother of two children, but through her business takes care of 200 children with the help of 60 employees. As she explains in the video: \u201cMy name is Shireen, owner of this kindergarten which was established in 2003. I established the Kindergarten because when I had my baby I didn't find a place to put her in during my work as a teacher until 5:00 pm. It was the first private Kindergarten in the area. Now there are 60 women working in my Kindergartens and 5 drivers, we created jobs for 60 women. Now we have 200 kids. The Kindergarten work starts beginning of September 2013.\u201d\n\nShireen works with a small profit margin to ensure her kindergarten\u2019s services are affordable for working families. Continuing to provide services with a high level of attention to details Shireen is taking an SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount of $25,000 which she will use to install a fire alarm system, fix water pipes, and renew some of the furnishing and carpeting as required by local regulations.\n\nShireen would one day like to also open an orphanage to provide care and education for children most in need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":25000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":25000,"image":{"id":1431416,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2882,"youtubeId":"JAAPaeMQl28","title":"Kiva Borrower

Jamshed will buy the cotton from his fellow villagers. He has already bought the space for the facility. Jamshed is requesting a loan to buy equipment. He does not have enough personal savings to make this purchase as this kind of technology is very expensive. Jamshed is trying his best to succeed and find a source of income.

","en":"Elyor is a positive and friendly man. He is married and has two children. Elyor was able to receive a secondary education. Now he works as a carpenter. He works in construction and renovating private residential properties. He makes a decent income from this. He recently left his parent's home and lives with his wife and children in their own home. He built his own house not long ago.  Currently, Elyor has started his own business of animal husbandry in order to have additional earnings, as his carpenter's salary is not enough to address all the needs of his family. Now Elyor wants to buy several cows to fatten them up and resell them. This is why he turned to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to buy cattle.

Communication and here is her story.\r\n\u201cThe American University of Central Asia is the university of my dreams. I planned to enter this university two years ago and since then I have been studying to the best of my abilities to make my dream come true. I have always tried to find out as much information about AUCA as possible. For this I have been surfing the internet, communicating with current students and my aunt, who also graduated from AUCA. I am really happy that I am a student of AUCA now and that I could make it happen. \r\nFive years ago I could not even imagine that I would enter the Journalism department. I had a great desire to become a doctor. However, I understood with years that I don\u2019t want to devote my life to medicine. I am such a sociable person. I always try to be in touch with the situation. So, I think that a profession of a journalist suits me most and I have several reasons for this. \r\nFirst, a profession of journalist is by far the most interesting one for me. It is always great to learn all the news and to find out some facts that are not open to general public. Secondly, I want to learn how to use words correctly. Unfortunately, nowadays there is too much false information on the Internet. May aim is to tell people true facts about our world. Thirdly, I want to make changes in my lovely country. \r\nUnfortunately my parents can\u2019t afford full tuition at AUCA. My family is pretty big, which consists of 6 people. So I need a KIVA loan, because it will help me to think about education, to study well and not to think about finance.\u201d

Oliver hopes that in the future she will be able to increase her stock. \n\nOliver is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Oliver, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1427216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

His father was the one who taught him this work.  Before becoming a barber, he worked as a farmer. In addition,  he worked in a factory, but he had to commute a long way and he barely had time with his family. One day, he was worried because he had nothing for his family. He remembered his father's words: \"this will be useful for you when you have a home\". Today he is grateful that his father taught him this work. He is getting his family ahead and the best thing is that he spends more time with them.

thank Kiva lenders for the previous loan. The loan enabled Knox to purchase solar lanterns which he sold to interested REEP members on short term loans, repayed with a small amount of interest. The beneficiaries of the lanterns have finished repaying their loans and now are happy they no longer have to spend money on kerosene. They recount that these lanterns are ideal for children to read and write by; they are portable for farmers to use to go about their daily chores after sunset; they are able to charge their mobile phones and brighten up their dwellings. \r\n\r\nThe organization group membership has increased from 400 groups to 520 groups in the last one year. Among the products offered by REEP, solar lanterns have been the most successful product because of their huge economic and social value: cutting down the recurring paraffin costs and carbon emissions. \r\n\r\nMr. Knox is determined to replace all the smoky unsafe candles and kerosene lamps among the members with the solar lanterns which offer bright and safe light and come with a mobile phone charging function. There is still a huge portion of the group without solar lanterns, so the demand is still very high for him to meet from his limited cash flow. Knox is therefore requesting a new loan to buy more lanterns for selling to the members. On the uploaded photo is Knox with Loice, a member of one of the new groups to join REEP.  She has just purchased a solar lamp on a loan from REEP.

He has 3 children and has been doing this work for 8 years. His primary income sources are milk, tea, and crops.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'High returns.' His biggest challenge is 'Lack of proper funding.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Terett.'\r\n\r\nPeter was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'it gives out loans at a low interest.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'It has a low interest rate.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expenses are transportation costs.

After I knew that history subject is one of the major subjects in this field, I entered an Olympiad studies in my lyceum. In 2002 Oblast History Competition I won fourth place. My teacher gave me a mass of information about this type of profession and gave an idea to study in AUCA, department of ICP, because she herself pursued her Masters\u2019 Degree at this university. Many educated people I know are devoting themselves to society\u2019s life and have education in this field. \r\n\r\n\"The most I like in this profession is that it has many directions. A person who knows politics can manage the whole society. Politics is one of the most important parts of society\u2019s life. So it is mostly about power. A politician is a person who knows  how the mechanisms of power look like and work. A politician can feel and use his or her power in the whole society\u2019s life as well as in his little district. Politician\u2019s work seems to me both important for society and for a person himself. To become a high qualified specialist in this field I chose to study at AUCA. \r\n\r\n\"Another thing that attracts my attention in this field is that politicians bring together their work, journalists\u2019, economists\u2019 work. AUCA also gives a unique opportunity for students who need financial aid, which is Kiva loan. I am applying for Kiva loan, which will cover part of my tuition fees.\u201d

Tres d\u00edas a la semana. Antes de dedicarse a las artesan\u00edas vend\u00eda productos por cat\u00e1logo, del cual obten\u00eda sus ingresos.  \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando, es para comprar  hilo para las matatas y bolsones, espelma, pita para adornar las diademas. El pr\u00e9stamo le ayudara, porque podr\u00e1 comprar de una vez toda la materia prima ya que comprando por separado se le hace m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, porque le sale m\u00e1s caro y deja de comprar otros art\u00edculos para el hogar.\n\nUno de sus sue\u00f1os es ampliar su negocio. En cuanto a la familia, pretende que sus hijos estudien de ser posible  a nivel superior y puedan  ser profesionales y  tener as\u00ed  una vida tranquila, con las comodidades que una familia necesita. \n\nTodo esto lo har\u00e1 por medio de las ganancias que le genere el negocio, su negocio lo ampliara construyendo un local, ya que donde vende actualmente lo comparte con otras compa\u00f1eras.\n","en":"Otilia is 33 years old and only studied as far as fourth grade, since when she was of school age there was the armed conflict which stopped her from studying further. She has a partner and he works in agriculture growing basic grains. Their children still live with them and are studying; the oldest daughter is in the first year of college, the second daughter is in 7th grade and their son is in third grade.\r\n\r\nOtilia earns a living making and selling crafts such as hemp bags, handbags, purses, bracelets and earrings. She has now been doing this for 3 years. She learnt how to do this because she attended a workshop where all of these craft techniques were being taught. This project was promoted by Fomilenio. She started by making a few products which sold out quickly with the arrival of tourists in the area where she lives and so she was encouraged to increase her business. She makes the products at home and then takes them to the business which is situated in the centre of the community, 300 metres from her house. She sells from 8am to 5pm, 3 days a week. Before selling crafts she used to sell products from catalogues and this is how she made a living.\r\n\r\nThe loan Otilia is asking for is to buy hemp fabric for bags and purses, wax, and hemp fibre for decorating hairbands. The loan will help her because she will be able to buy all of her materials in one go. When she has to buy items separately it makes it more difficult as it works out more expensive and this stops her from buying other items for the home.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to expand her business. As far as the family goes, she hopes her children will be able to study in higher education and become professionals so they won't have any worries in life and will have everything a family needs.\r\n\r\nShe will do all of this with the profits she gets from her business. She will increase the business by building her own premises, since the place where she sells currently is shared with other women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1452127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy hemp fabric for bags and purses, wax, and hemp fibre for decorating hairbands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T16:20:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Otilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":36.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":37.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.16},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":29.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":29.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505278},{"amount":22.94,"local_amount":22.94,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":22.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716359},{"amount":547.48,"local_amount":547.48,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":547.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449621985}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T03:21:34Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":620515,"name":"Rosa Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa es una mujer que est\u00e1 felizmente casada con Jos\u00e9 Arias y juntos han procreado 5 hijos los mismos que ya han realizado sus vidas cada uno de forma independiente.

She is married to Norberto, a farmer, and is the mother of two children who are already working and have their own families. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the farm. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nAnita operates a dalandan (Philippine orange) farm. She grows the fruit on their farm located in Cavite. She sells her product to markets and fruit stores that she regularly supplies and to the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 9000 in sales each month. \r\n\r\nCuriously, dalandan has been called \"sweet orange\" or \"sour orange\" in English. In the Philippines, the flesh is orange while the skin is green and thin enough to be easily peeled off with the fingers. The fruit is peeled and eaten by Filipinos, usually with a bit of rock salt if it is sour, and dalandan juice is popular drink in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nTo help Anita continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs for her business. Part of the loan will go for the maintenance of her farm. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAnita dreams to expand her business and help her children through all her hard work.

Actualmente solicita el cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de repuestos para reparaci\u00f3n de equipos de sonido y televisores, de esta forma podr\u00e1 tener los recursos necesarios para cumplir con la demanda de servicio, dando como resultado un incremento favorable en los ingresos familiares. Jos\u00e9 desea seguir trabajando arduamente para poder cumplir el sue\u00f1o de montar un almac\u00e9n de electrodom\u00e9sticos en un local propio y, as\u00ed tener una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica para dar a sus hijos una buena educaci\u00f3n y un mejor bienestar. ","en":"Jos\u00e9, 39, is father of two children and head of household since separating from his wife.  He worked in an electronics repair shop in his community for many years repairing radios and television sets.  However, availing himself of an opportunity the shop\u2019s owner was offering, he decided to take over the business and with the experience and skills he\u2019d acquired passed from being an employee to being the owner of the establishment.  \r\n\r\nHowever, he wasn\u2019t doing too well so he decided to move to another town and set up the business again and now he has the advantage of having less competition in his new location which has led to his being able to generate enough income to support his family during the 8 years he\u2019s been working independently.  His drive, effort and positive outlook have led him to overcome the difficulties that have arisen and he\u2019s always been able to get ahead motivated by his children.\r\n\r\nAt present, he\u2019s requesting a loan to buy spare parts to repair sound equipment and television sets.  In this way, he\u2019ll be able to have the necessary resources to meet service requests which will result in a favorable increase in family income.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 wants to continue working hard to reach his dream of opening a home appliance store in a locale of his own to attain economic stability and to provide his children with a good education and improved well-being.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1452153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

She has 4 children and has been doing farming work for 8 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and tea.\r\n\r\nAnnah stated that what is most enjoyable about farming is: 'Returns!'   Her biggest challenge is 'lack of enough capital.'   Annah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'it gives farmers incentives.'  She was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.  She replied: 'how to develop a savings culture.'   Her highest monthly expense is school fees.

She\u2019s married and her husband works in agriculture and as a day laborer.  They have two children living at home.  One of them is 20-years-old and he\u2019s disabled so neither attends school nor works.  Their daughter attends first year of high-school at the Instituto Nacional.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has worked in agriculture since she was little; her parents taught her how to work the land and grow corn and beans.  Since her family was of scarce economic resources they only worked the land and did no other activity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to working the land, Mar\u00eda also bakes bread to sell in her community.  To reach her fields that are a kilometer away to do her agricultural chores she must take a 20-minute walk.  Her husband helps her do the agricultural work and her daughter helps out too.  Her work schedule isn\u2019t fixed; they do the work whenever it\u2019s necessary.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s requesting is to buy two sacks of manure for the crops and also to pay to transport the manure.  They will obtain a better harvest to last through the dry season which will guarantee that they won\u2019t run out of basic supplies for the family.\r\n\r\nShe wants to increase both her agricultural output and the bread production to improve her quality of life and to have a better house.  Her hopes for her children is that they will become upstanding citizens, that her daughter is able to complete a university career and that they are of service to their community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1452154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy two sacks of manure and to pay for their transport.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T18:00:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":114.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":135.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622385},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517527031}],"funded_date":"2013-10-16T18:30:13Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":617945,"name":"Khurshid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khurshid is living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan, with her spouse and 5 children.

He was studying economics in university, but two years ago, after his father's passing, he had to put his studies on hold and tend to the business in which his father worked his whole life -- a distributor of watermelon and other fruits.  There he works daily, putting in long hours that begin at 2:00am.  \r\n\r\nHis primary customers are clinics and hospitals, street vendors and some ice cream shops in the city.

This will give the store a better image and will help him by attracting more customers, because when it comes to food, people are much more demanding with regard to cleanliness and the shop's appearance.\r\n\r\nAll this will help him to continue striving for what he inherited from his father, and he will have the possibility to continue supporting his family.

David\u2019s wife, Maryam, is employed at the beauty salon and works as a hair stylist.\r\n\r\nNow, David is requesting a small loan to start up his own beauty salon and his wife will work there. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of a business startup and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nDavid wants to acquire the space and purchase all the needed modern inventories for a hair care business. Maryam will serve the customers as a stylist and generate daily income. According to the couple\u2019s estimates, the business will be lucrative and the increased profit will be reinvested in the same business. \r\n\r\nDavid and Maryam will be able to improve the living

It is really important to make the right choice what profession one wants to gain. Therefore, I have enrolled in the American University of Central Asia, Department of International and Comparative Politics. \r\n\r\n\"I am impressed by AUCA\u2019s rich history and its current efforts connected to inclusiveness and equality. The collaboration between the faculty and undergraduate students, the sense of community, and flexible interdisciplinary nature of the curriculum is all important to me. \r\n\r\n\"I have been interested in studying international relations or international politics for many years. My interest in pursuing this field stems from several factors which have affected me. The first factor is my studies in the US. I had a great chance to represent my country. That year gave me a lot of experience, feelings, and thoughts. \r\n\r\n\"Second, I am fascinated by history, economics, and diplomacy. I believe, through the study of international politics, I can effectively satisfy my curiosity in these fields. \r\n\r\n\"And the third factor that had affected my interest in international politics is that I would like to become a person to represent our country abroad. The last thing I can tell about my choice is that I believe that, after graduation of AUCA, I will become professional in the political field. \r\n\r\n\"Participating in my high-school\u2019s debate program has been my most meaningful activity in the US. This experience has changed me. I have learned how to speak in front of a huge number of students, without getting nervous and how to argue the merits of any side. \r\n\r\n\"Taking part in the debates also gave me an opportunity to be aware of current topics of global importance, such as the debate problems of the homeless, healthcare, etc. I think participation in debates will help me in my future career. It is something that I feel enthusiastic about.\r\n\r\n\"The other point worth mentioning about AUCA is that it gives the students a very unique opportunity which is a loan for students to be able to cover their tuition fees. I will take an opportunity to apply for it also, which will give me a good opportunity to be able to cover my tuition fees.\u201d

All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial condition and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Sergo applied for a loan from MFO Credo. His request was approved within the framework of their Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of 2,000 GEL will help Sergo to purchase a car. He will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them in return for a service fee.

He is married to Ma. Theresa, a tutor, and he is a father of two children; the eldest is in high school while the youngest is in elementary. By the grace of God, Rosauro has managed to support his children's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to continually send his children to school to finish their degrees.\r\n\r\nRosauro oversees operations of their jeepney* (see footnote) transportation business. They have a jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new tires for the jeepneys, and renew his registration. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nRosauro dreams that his children will finish their education. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his work every week.\r\n\r\n* Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney. It is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

This is the place where straw hats are from.\r\n\r\nIt is here in Montecristi that Ana lives. She is 39 years old and a single mother to two children, ages 20 and 13. The youngest goes to school.  She has been in the communal bank since it began, and she likes it for the help they give with the loans.\r\n\r\nAna is a very tenacious woman who has always liked to work in order to help her children get ahead, as she is both mother and father to them. She does what she can so that the children do not need for anything. \r\n\r\nAna has a business at home, where she sells chicken by the pound, as well as water, soda, and other items. Every day she goes out to a farm in the city where she buys the chickens. Later she slaughters them to then sell, either whole or by the pound. Ana has been doing this work for fifteen years and, with it, she has helped her children get ahead.\r\n\r\nAna is repeating the loan because the previous one helped her a lot.

I know many young people who want to study in this university. AUCA gives excellent education in different professions. I know that almost all the graduates of AUCA can easily find good jobs in different international organizations and embassies, and take up new initiatives either in business or in politics. \r\n\r\nI have been preparing for entrance exams for a long time and finally passed them. I have chosen the department of International and Business Law. Law is a system of rules and guidelines, usually enforced through a set of institutions. It shapes politics, economics and society in numerous ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between government and society. I studied law and history at high school and always took part in city Olympiads. I think that the IBL department is the best choice for me because I am very interested in studying law and working in this area in the future. Kyrgyzstan has a huge number of lawyers, but not all of them are highly qualified specialists. I am sure I will become a highly qualified lawyer after graduating from the American University of Central Asia. \r\n\r\nAUCA has a very good system of teaching, and another feature of it is the financial aid available to students. The financial aid comes from Kiva and is a good opportunity for students who cannot afford their tuition fees. I am one of those applying for this kind of loan, and I hope I will be awarded one.\u201d \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":305,"image":{"id":1448327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for his higher education.

He also raises small animals like chickens and pigs on a small scale.  Jobito works every day of the week at his house.  If they seek him out to do jobs outside of the community, he also does that.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy wood and tile.  He needs to make some changes to the house because the wood that he has is in bad condition.  He needs to improve it in order to have a more secure home.  There is a risk that it will break, and an accident could occur.\r\n\r\nHe has already ordered the wood, and it will cost him approximately $500.00.  He also estimated that the labor will cost $200.00.  He needs the rest for household expenses.\r\n\r\nJobito dreams of expanding his business and of buying more high-tech equipment (a table planer).  He states that he is totally prepared to support his children\u2019s education so that they are able to become professionals in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1452235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood and tiles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jobito De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":106.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":115.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":126.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":137.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":163.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.66,"local_amount":123.66,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":123.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716648},{"amount":110.56,"local_amount":110.56,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":110.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215699},{"amount":126.28,"local_amount":126.28,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525656},{"amount":137.83,"local_amount":137.83,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":137.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419162},{"amount":151.95,"local_amount":151.95,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":151.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768182},{"amount":149.72,"local_amount":149.72,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":149.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833800}],"funded_date":"2013-11-14T02:45:34Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:08:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":618011,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou is 33 years old and married with two children, one of whom is in school.

This is the issue of choice of profession. I have chosen the faculty of International and Business Law. The definition of law states that a lawyer is a person who practices law and delivers justice. The role of the lawyer varies significantly across legal jurisdictions. So, as regards to the above topic, I would like to become a lawyer. It is a profession which is to serve people. \r\n\r\nI think the American University of Central Asia will prepare me to become a highly qualified specialist in international and business law systems, because it is a modern university with a western system of education that prepares good experts. \r\n\r\nHowever, without any financial aid I will not be able to be part of it. I would be very grateful if you consider my candidacy for scholarship and give me an opportunity to acquire knowledge and also to realize my ambitions at

She is married to a carpenter with seven children, but her husband's income is not enough to take care of the home. \r\n\r\nAbibatu began her business because she wants to be independent. In 1998, she established her general stock business. She works at the business for nine hours per day, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nAbibatu requires a loan in order to purchase more items, like cigarettes, biscuits, soap, and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and to have a permanent business location. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Abibatu plans to own the biggest shop in the community.

She works at the business 12 hours per day and seven days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation and price changes.\r\n\r\nAminata requires a loan in order to buy palm oil and a bag of okara to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and repay her loan. In the future, Aminata plans to expand her business even more.

She has faced so many challenges in living, like sickness and death of her love ones, attack by thieves, inadequate finance to start up a business of her own, and catering to her family's needs.\r\n\r\nWith this requested new loan, she will expand her shoe business by increasing the bags of shoes, renting a storeroom, and part of the loan will go for transportation. She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has been doing it for a long time, and has regular customers who buy from her, especially during the months of September, February, and December. With this business activity, the community will benefit because she sells at moderate prices, she sells quality shoes, and the distance to buy from the market will be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe profit from this loan will be used for her family needs, to ensure her children are educated, and to provide medication for her family when needs arise. \r\n\r\nShe prefers the GHAPE loan because of low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals, and also the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1448396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Shoes","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy shoes, pay for her storeroom, and transport","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 6 hijos todos ya mayores de edad, se caso a los 18 a\u00f1os de edad, con quien ha convivido hasta este d\u00eda, juntos han trabajado muy fuerte para sacar adelante a sus hijos, cuatro de ellos ya se casaron y tienen sus propias familias. En la casa de habitaci\u00f3n solo vive con su esposo y dos de sus hijos quienes trabajan y le ayudan a ella en el hogar.\n\nSus hijos todos son bachilleres y no ha seguido apoy\u00e1ndolos en los estudios universitarios, por falta de dinero.\nBernardina, no estudio pues sus padres no quisieron, enviarla a estudiar ni a sus otros cinco hermanos que ella tiene.\n\n\nElla se dedica desde los 20 a\u00f1os de edad, a la elaboraci\u00f3n de hamacas, pues ella asisti\u00f3 a un taller en el municipio en donde aprendi\u00f3 y con el paso de los a\u00f1os ella ha ido perfeccionando el arte. Antes hacia hamacas de cascarilla, ahora hace hamacas de seda y de poliseda, elabora  un promedio de 5 a 6 hamacas en el mes y las comercializa en la ciudad, donde tambi\u00e9n compra el material, esto le toma 30 minutos caminando hasta donde tiene que ir a tomar el bus y luego hace 30 minutos en el bus para llegar a la ciudad.\n\n Compra cada 15 o 22 d\u00edas el material para elaborar las hamacas. Se dedica hacer las hamacas despu\u00e9s de los quehaceres del hogar, por las tardes, sus hijos tambi\u00e9n le ayudan cuando vienen de trabajar la agricultura.\n\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es  para comprar una caja de hilo de seda, el cual esta valorada en $450 y el resto para otros gastos del hogar. Con ello,  podr\u00e1 elaborar mas hamacas y tendr\u00e1 mas ofertas para los clientes, pues en la temporada de noviembre y diciembre hay mas demanda por la \u00e9poca navide\u00f1a.\n\n\nEl sue\u00f1o, es seguir trabajando cada d\u00eda mas, para elaborar mas hamacas y poder vender mas.\nAdemas sue\u00f1a mejorar su vivienda, ya que las paredes y el piso es de tierra, esto lo lograra poco a poco mediante las ganancias que espera percibir de las ventas de las hamacas, esta ahorrando para ello.\n\n","en":"Bernardina is 53 years old and the mother of six grown children.  She married when she was 18 and is still together with her husband to this day.  Together they have worked very hard so their kids could get ahead.  Four of them are married and have their own families. She now lives with her husband and only two of their children who work and help around the house.\r\n\r\nHer children have all graduated from high school and she has not continued supporting them with university studies because she doesn't have the money. Bernarda did not go to school because her parents didn't want to send her or her five other siblings. She has been working at making hammocks since the age of 20.  She went to a workshop in her town where she learned, and over time she has perfected the art. She used to make the hammocks from husks, but now she uses silk and poly silk.  She makes 5 or 6 hammocks per month and sells them in the city where she also buys the materials.  It takes her 30 minutes to walk to where she catches the bus, and the ride into the city takes another 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nShe buys the materials to make the hammocks every 15 or 20 days and she makes them in the afternoon after finishing her household chores. Her children help her after they return from working in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundacion Campo is to buy a box of silk yarn which costs $450 and she will use the rest for household expenses. With the loan, she will be able to make more hammocks and provide a better selection for her customers. In November and December demand increases because of the Christmas holidays. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue working more each day so she can make and sell more hammocks.

He is applying for a loan to be able to pay for his studies. This is his story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Pedro Emmanuel. I am 20 years old. I live in East Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic. I am single. I have a sister, and my parents are divorced. I live with my mother, who hasn't been able to see since she was 7 years old, but this has not been an impediment in being able to raise her family. Now she is retired, even though in our country jobs are scarce for people with these conditions.\r\n\r\nI have a great desire to study marketing, a career with which I identified since I was in secondary school. I would like to enter the APEC University. In spite of having completed my [secondary] studies two years ago, it has been difficult for me to begin university studies. It is for this reason that i have turned to this [source of] help.\r\n\r\nI need this help because it is the way to be able to reach and make a reality of my dreams. With the achievement of my goals of being a great professional in the area of marketing, I will be able to give a better quality of life to my family.\r\n\r\nPart of my dreams is to have a position in the area of marketing with a prestigious business before finishing my course of study. Thus at the time I finish my university studies, my academic knowledge will be complemented with acquired working knowledge and I will thus be able to occupy the best positions in the area.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1452742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is married with one child age 20 years. In 2000, Rugiatu established her charcoal business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 12 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation and price changes.\r\n\r\nRugiatu requires a loan in order to buy more bags of charcoal to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and take care of her family's welfare. In the future, Rugiatu plans to change her business to a big provision shop. She thanks you for your
