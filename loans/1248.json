They all live in a four bedroom apartment in Bamenda.  She has faced many challenges in life like: sickness, an accident, inadequate finance to start up a business and the death of family members.\r\nWith this new loan she has requested, she will invest in buying more chicks for her farm, feed, seedlings like beans, yams, maize, coca yams and increase stock at her store of sweets, bread, and biscuits. She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has been doing it for a long time and the demand for chickens is high. She has regular customers because her  store has a great location. In addition, the manure from the chickens will be used on the farm to increase yield. With this business activity, the community will benefit from manure which will be used for farming, reduced transportation costs for her nearby clients and the availability of chickens for people to buy for special occasions. \r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will cater to her family's needs, ensure her children's quality education, expand her provision store, invest in her poultry farm and also save some money to undertake bigger investments. She prefers loans form GHAPE because of the low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals and also the borrowers are trained in marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed. Also, social needs of members are met at GHAPE.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1448488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy items such as biscuits, bread, sweets, seedlings and chickens for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Mile 90, Bamenda, N.W.

Little by little she has figured out how to tackle them, so that now her ambitions are not only to get by, but also to challenge herself to achieve more and not to leave her ideas unfulfilled. \r\n\r\nShe is 33 years old, is married, and is the mother of four children. Of these, three go to school and help their parents in the field, and the youngest is still breastfeeding. She is a homemaker and farmer, following her family tradition. Mar\u00eda Julia did not have the opportunity to study, and so she works very hard every day so that her children do not have to suffer the same situation as she did when she was young. The land that she and her family work is located in the same area as their house, which makes it easier to constantly tend and maintain it.\r\n\r\nHer dreams as a mother are to see her children become professionals, and to feel proud of the effort that she and her husband make so that their children have a better life, a better future, and better opportunities than they themselves had. For this reason she has sought a loan with which she hopes to buy fertilizers, manure, and other inputs that will give a better protection to her crops and help produce better foliage.

She has been faced with many difficulties in life including inadequate capital to finance her business, accidents, sickness, and worst of all the death of her husband.\r\n\r\nShe has taken and successfully repaid her four previous loans. With the new loan she has requested she will expand her farm output by buying farm seedlings, pesticides, and fertilizer for her farm. She has positive expectations for her business, because she has been doing it for a long time and has regular customers who buy her farm produce. She has a good business location where she sells her farm output. With her increased output, the community will benefit from a regular supply of food at greatly reduced prices.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will take care of her family's needs by providing them with medical care and education. She will renovate her house and support her young ones in their education.  She prefers loans form GHAPE because of the low interest rates offered, convenient repayment intervals, and the business management education provided before loans are disbursed.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1448494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

She says that the main challenge to her business is the poor road network.\r\n\r\nYeabu requires a loan in order to buy more wood to expand her business.

He describes himself as honest. \r\n\r\nHe operates a store where he sells cooking pans and jikos (charcoal stoves). He has been involved in this business for six years. His business is located in a suburban area and his primary customers are retailers.

She works at the business from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m., seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nAdama requires a loan in order to purchase more palm oil to expand her business.

She works at the business 12 hours per day and seven days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation and price fluctuations.\r\n\r\nYa Alimamy requires a loan in order to buy more wood to expand her business.

Together with her husband, she is raising three children. In 1996, the couple started their own business of selling dishes from a rental container. She started this business with initial start-up capital in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Having been able to develop her business and attract loyal customers, Burulsun has an average monthly income of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to the hard work put into their business, the couple has been able to make home repairs and put up a fence. For the purpose of further increasing and expanding her business, Burulsun turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for a wholesale purchase of everyday use dishes for subsequent retail sale. Burulsun plans to invest the earnings from the loan to increase sales turnover.

He has three sons who are 9, 5, and 3 years old and a 7-year-old daughter. For five years, Safarali worked as a teacher of Tajik language and literature in his home town. He was not able to cover his family's expenses on a teacher's salary, which is why he took up fruit selling. His business is already six years old. He began his work with his brother so that he could learn marketing. Now he works alone, but he is not bored as his customers are his neighbors, and those who live close to him do not let him get bored.

He is married and has six children. \n\nBernard applied for a loan of UGX. 1,500,000 to improve his farming business.

He has been transporting goods between districts within the capital using his own small truck for quite a while. His wife works at a filling station. Their son studies at university. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and it needs some renovation, so he is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to buy necessary building materials such as cement, hardwood floors, vacuum-insulated windows and fiberglass. Using those materials, he will repair and renovate his house thus creating a comfortable and warm place for his family. Also the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating and release fewer pollutants into air, a contribution to the efforts against air pollution.

In June 2012, she decided to take it over when the diocese wanted to close the school, renaming it Affirmation Academy. Now, nearly 37 years later, Everlyn is managing the school of 70 students, grades K-8, with many of the same staff who started working with her at Queen of Angels.\r\n\r\nEverlyn is a passionate educator. She received her Bachelor\u2019s degree in urban education from Rutgers University and later her Master\u2019s in administration and supervision from St. Peters University. After graduation, she decided to stay and work in her neighborhood of Newark, NJ.\r\n\r\nAffirmation Academy, Everlyn describes, is challenging and academic-focused. The school utilizes an integrated literacy-based curriculum, and is unique in that it provides an inclusive, caring environment without excusing laziness. Classes are small, with fewer than 15 students in each. Students are encouraged to give back to their community as well.\r\n\r\nEventually, Everlyn would like to be able to reduce tuition costs for parents, and to become a charter school. Her vision is for Affirmation Academy to expand into a larger high school. \r\n\r\nIn August of this year, Everlyn started making moves toward this vision and transported the school to a new and better site in Newark. The funds from this loan will help with the expenses of relocation.

He has 2 children and has been doing this work for 11 years. His primary income sources are: milk, eggs, transportation services (motor bike), and personal business-as an extra source of income.\n\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Better profits.' His biggest challenge is 'Insufficient capital.' Animals on the farm have been given the name of 'Kanini.'\n\nTom was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'They offer better services.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Savings are used as collateral.'\n\nHis highest monthly expense is family expenses.

lives in the Ndaragwa area of Kenya, which has one of the cooler climates in Kenya. He has 3 children and has been doing mixed farming for 10 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, and transportation services.\n\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Selling his farm produce.' His biggest challenge is 'Watering crops in drought seasons and that is why he wants to purchase a water pump.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\n\nSamuel was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'it has better loan terms.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'One can improve their lives through borrowing.'\n\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family.', Samuel replied 'Will improve his farming hence more income.'\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

She is the single mother of two children.  The children\u2019s father does not support her because he is an alcoholic.  The children depend only upon her.  The two of them go to school.  The only support she has is from her mother because she lives in her house.\r\n\r\nAna has been selling tortillas in the market for two years.  She started the business at the time that she separated from her life partner.  She did this as a way of looking to support her two children.  She only walks four blocks from her house to the business because it is close by.  She starts working in her tortilla business at five in the morning, and she finishes at one in the afternoon.  She works eight hours a day every day without resting.  A cousin helps her; she also works every day with her.\r\n\r\nThe loan she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy corn and a propane gas griddle.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nRanil dreams of having a bigger food stall and hopes to have a better life.

Currently, her husband and sons are working in Russia, and Nargis lives in the city of Vahdat with her daughter.  Nargis is a skilled worker.  She has been earning a living by providing seamstress services for 20 years.  She sews women's dresses to order and makes beautiful embroideries on them.  Her services are always in demand because the majority of women prefer to purchase fabrics and have dresses custom-made for them.  Now Nargis is planning to expand her business and purchase a new modernized sewing machine, with the help of which her work process would improve.  She wants to use the rest of the loan money to make repairs at home in order to prepare for the winter cold.  She really needs the loan and promises to repay it on-time from her sewing business and money transfers from her

This group is made up of eight members and is run by a board of directors, which has Justina as its president.  The members have different kinds of businesses, among them: selling clothes, selling condiments, grocery stores, knitting rugs, driver, corner shops, and selling food.\r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit the small businesses in Justina's group.  Justina tells us that she joined Pro Mujer two years ago, following an invitation from a friend who was already a member.  Justina currently has a business doing knitting work and selling blankets.  She tells us that she learned this trade years ago from her mother.

It is composed of eight members and is headed by a board and Justina is the President. The businesses that the community association members carried forward are varied among them which include: weaving blankets, sewing garments, and coats along with the sale of shoe insoles and potatoes. \r\n\r\nThe loan they will take out will benefit small microenterprises where Justina is a member. She points out that two years ago, she became a member of Pro Mujer through the invitation of a friend who was also a member of the institution. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she has a business workshop in blanket weaving.  She learned this type of work at a technical institute. Beforehand, with a little amount of capital, she bought a sewing machine and with the Pro Mujer loan, she expanded her business. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out will increase capital by purchasing wool from other stores in the city of El Alto.

She has done this for over 20 years. \r\n\r\nThe loan Mercedes is requesting is to increase her working capital (buying cheese) in the markets of the city of El Alto and later resell in her commercial space. This work allows her to generate the resources she needs to support her household as she is married and has two children. Asked what she liked about Pro Mujer she replied that she enjoyed the health and loan training sessions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5325,"image":{"id":1450344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cheese.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":5325,"lender_count":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina Dolores\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bety  Beatriz\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":36768,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4210.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4289.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4406.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4526.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4649.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4776.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4906.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5002.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":609.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":621.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":638.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":655.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":673.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":691.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":710.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":724.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1231.03,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8505.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615367},{"amount":638.19,"local_amount":4406.56,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4409.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736307},{"amount":655.58,"local_amount":4526.68,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4529.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641817},{"amount":673.43,"local_amount":4649.88,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4653.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108751},{"amount":691.8,"local_amount":4776.72,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4780.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923804},{"amount":710.53,"local_amount":4906.08,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4909.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144661},{"amount":724.44,"local_amount":5002.08,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5005.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838424}],"funded_date":"2013-11-16T16:29:33Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:35:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":619277,"name":"Primero De Mayo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cPRIMERO DE MAYO\u201d  Iniciar\u00e1n el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Villa Exaltaci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Juana es la Secretaria.

Baalngir district of Odisha, India. The young lady standing second from right with a raised hand in the photograph is Nandini. She resides with her husband, one son of 10 years and one daughter of 7 years. \n\nFor the last two years, Nandini has been running a home shop of ladies\u2019 fancy items like bangles, talc, plastic items, cosmetics, ornaments, ready-made garments, etc. in her house. Prior to this business, Nandini's husband was running a tailoring center and was earning a monthly income of 3,000 INR (Indian rupees), which was not at all sufficient to manage the household expenses along with the study expenses of her children. \n\nSo, Nandini discussed the situation with her husband and started this business. Now her fancy store is running well. Nandini brings the stock from different towns like Titilagarh, Bargarh, Raipur, etc. In the present situation, Nandini is earning a monthly income of 3,000 INR and supporting her family. But she has a dream to earn more and establish herself well, so she wants to increase the volume of her business to increase the income. \n\nThis year, Nandini, along with three other like-minded women of her town, formed a group named \u201cOmm Sairam\u201d and availed a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. From this loan amount of 10,000 INR, Nandini wants to invest the entire amount to purchase ladies\u2019 footwear, which will be a new item for her business. She hopes this will attract the women from her locality and fetch a handful of income to her. \n\nNandini hopes to construct a good cabin for her business and give better education to her children.\n\nThe other three energetic group members are Mita, Sunita and Pramila, who are doing a beauty parlor, dry wash center, and general store business respectively.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1446103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase ladies' footwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T18:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T18:50:12Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nandini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":44000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T04:52:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":616659,"name":"Suriya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suriya, age 45, lives with her family in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

Therefore for the past 4 years he has also been driving a taxi at night. Currently he is not able to generate any income from the taxi, as its engine is not working properly and needs to be repaired. Rukhsana has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan to meet the amount needed to repair the engine of her husband's taxi. With the profit her husband wants to open a new auto mechanic shop in the future.

He owns three greenhouses: two of them are three sotkas in size and one is five sotkas.  Vladimir is involved in growing flowers and tomatoes in greenhouses.  He has employees who work in his greenhouses during the sowing and harvesting seasons.  His whole family is involved in this business.

He lives day to day milking cows at a farm. He is single, has no children, and comes from a modest, low-income family. His parents gave him an education commensurate with his future, which meant he was able to finish the first three years of school. An accident prevented him from going back to school or even working for a period of time. When he recovered, his former job had been filled. He now has a job that requires working in two shifts--one from 3 a.m. until 11 a.m. and the other from 3:30 p.m. until 7 p.m.--which doesn't allow him time to study.\r\n\r\nHis biggest dream is to have his own business that would generate good income and allow him more free time to finish school. Klever has applied for a loan to make that dream possible. He will invest to start a chicken farm. This business idea was born from the fact that there are many restaurants in the area that sell chicken soups and stews and would be the potential market for this enterprising man. Klever knows a lot about the business because, when he was young, he helped his father on their small farm and became an expert in raising animals. \r\n\r\nKlever thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva for giving him the chance to realize his dream and for believing in his entrepreneurial spirit.

Now, this enthusiastic woman needs financial support to be able to purchase a new stock of clothing to sell to customers.\r\n\r\nShe has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

","en":"Andrea is very happy as with her first loan \u2013 she was able to buy the supplies needed to support her coffee crops, meaning she was able to profit from the first harvest and sell at a very good price with which she obtained excellent profits. She produced 50 quintals which she sold at a strong price and was able to meet her loan repayments. The profits were healthy and she reinvested in her crops, managing to buy new seedlings to grow and increase her crops that bit more; sowing a larger variety, and keeping in mind the vision of covering a greater demand, increasing the current offer. \r\n\r\nIn addition, she was also able to allocate a bit of money to her studies as this figures amongst her dreams and her greatest desire is to make it a reality. Andrea's business underwent a change because she improved her production thanks to the first loan, it also improved her quality of life as the income that she obtained was as hoped and this opened up the way to continue reinvesting in her crops. It is for this reason that this time she has decided to seek a second loan with which she will be able to sow the seedlings that she currently has in a large quantity, and prepare the land once again for the new product, which is necessary for the maintenance and protection of the crop in order to obtain good results."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1452891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to prepare the land to grow new coffee seedlings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.27,"local_amount":5.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042244},{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":1.75,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710585},{"amount":2.81,"local_amount":57.17,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":57.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449616548},{"amount":1421.83,"local_amount":28935.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":29076.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895447}],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T06:37:30Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":621041,"name":"Osmildo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Osmildo de 50 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su familia, \u00e9l se dedica a la compra y venta de chatarra como: hierro, aluminio, llantas, cobre, etc.  desde hace 5 a\u00f1os su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su lugar de residencia, posee clientela establecida que lo buscan por los buenos precios que ofrece, con lo que obtiene de su negocio logra llevar el sustento diario a su hogar, \u00e9l solicita el cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar m\u00e1s chatarra por quintales, una balanza y herramientas necesarias para poder seguir con su negocio que le genera buenas ganancias y as\u00ed el podr\u00e1 seguirle dando a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.

The members are Leticia (Lety), Adelina, Juana, Juliana, Benita, Hilaria, Graciela, and No\u00e9.  All the group members except Lety have asked for loans to use to buy lambs.  Leticia chose the name of the group because when she was invited to submit a loan request to VisionFund she was very impressed by it and it seemed like a great option for her.  For this reason, it was \"surprising\" to her when they arrived at her house to invite her to submit a loan application.\n\nLety is 39 years old and has been married to Jos\u00e9 for 20 years.  Together, they have formed a family and have 4 children, all of whom are currently in school.  Lety says that she has worked making embroidery, tablecloths, and basic clothes for several years.  She says that \"I got started out of necessity.  I lost my mother when I was little and I had to somehow learn how to work so I could help support my siblings.  Now, I do the same thing but instead work to support my children.\"\n\nCurrently, she is asking for a loan so she can make tablecloths and buy wool yarn, thread, and fabric.  Lety is very happy and grateful to Vision Fund because they have become a financial support to her family.  Even though her greatest difficulty is competition, she doesn't pay it much mind.  To the contrary, she does the best work she can so her customers will return to solicit her services as a seamstress.  \n\nHer profits have been very good and this has allowed her to improve her house.  In the past, Lety didn't have her own house and lived with her parents.  Now, however, she is very happy because she has not only been able to obtain her own house but has also been able to let her daughters study in private schools.\n\nLety and the rest of the group are very grateful to Vision Fund and to Kiva for the loans that they have been given and for all their services such as training and financial bonuses, which are very good.  Smiling, Lety says that \"To me, the bonuses have been a great support because with that small amount of money I can buy shoes, clothes, etc.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5650,"image":{"id":1363824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"for tablecloths, yarns, threads, fabric and sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":5650,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Letcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":74000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":5650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9250},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9250},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":9250},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":9250},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":9250},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":9250},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9250},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":9250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2825,"local_amount":37000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":37156.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991833},{"amount":1412.5,"local_amount":18500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":18578.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644481},{"amount":1412.5,"local_amount":18500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":18578.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877942}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T22:34:11Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":618369,"name":"Naseem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yasmeen is a 37-years-old married woman living with her four children and spouse in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

Bobojon works and lives with his wife and two-year-old daughter in the village of Hamadomi. For three years, he has worked as a teacher in a secondary school. Bobojon wants to additionally take up crop farming, like his fellow villagers do. Most of the population of Tajikistan practices farming and animal husbandry. The reason why the population prefers this kind of work is that Tajikistan has an advantageous climate and natural environment.\r\n\r\nWith his savings, Bobojon purchased a 1.5 hectare plot of land and wants to sow millet and onions there. In order to fulfill his goal, he is taking out a loan and is planning to buy millet and onion seeds with that money. He hopes his work will not be without reward and that next year, he will receive a bountiful harvest. Thanks to the loan, he will have an additional source of income, which will help him greatly improve his life and the life of his family.

","en":"Janatkhon, age 42, is a responsible and positive woman as well as a kind and caring mother.  She is married and she has three lovely young children.  Her husband is currently in Russia where he is making a living working as a construction worker.  He makes a reasonable income, which he sends to his family every month.  \n\nJanatkhon herself has been running her own business for almost seven years, which also helps to meet all her family's needs.  She bakes pastries such as cakes and biscuits and she conducts her business in her own, small, bakery shop.  A few other bakers also work in her shop, as Janatkhon cannot handle all the work herself.\n\nJanatkhon wants to buy some goods that she needs for baking, as well as some additional equipment.  As winter is approaching and food prices may go up, she would like to buy everything she can now.  For this purpose, she has turned to MDO Arvand and would like to receive a loan to buy baking goods.  She thanks Arvand in advance for their financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1443318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

For this reason, Pulotjon has turned to Arvand for help; by choosing from the various consumer loan packages they offer, he will have the money he needs to put his plans into motion. Specifically, he plans on using the loan to buy construction materials, and would like to thank Arvand in advance for their financial assistance.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Lahore, Pakistan. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been driving an auto rickshaw but has to pay a daily rental because this rickshaw does not belong to him. He is not a landlord; he has to feed his children three times a day, as well as meet educational expenses and utility bills. Now his children are growing older, with a rapid increase in their needs. \r\n\r\nHe has worried for many days about how to abstain from the daily rental, so he decided to buy his own rickshaw. He saved for a long time to buy a new auto rickshaw, but at the time of purchasing some money still remained short.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sajida has requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy a new rickshaw, together with his savings.  She hopes that now her husband will no longer have to pay the rent, which will mean an increase in income. \r\n\r\nSajida is very happy after taking this loan and says thank you to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

She is a single mother of five children. Three of them live outside the country. The two others live with her and are involved in all the field activities that are necessary for their coffee crops to remain in perfect condition. Alba del Carmen is a housewife and a farmer. She has a degree in Primary Education. \r\n\r\nAs the mother of a family and a hard-working, enterprising woman she ensures the well-being of her family. She also has a small store in her residence which generates some more income for the family. The land she works along with her children is hers. She got this through good management of her revenues and today she thanks God for the opportunity to have it.

She used the profit to pay school fees and covered household expenses.  \r\n\r\nLeonard will use this loan to buy more sodas, juices, beer, wines, spirits, rice, maize flour, meat, chicken and more Irish potatoes for making chips.  She dreams of building a guest house.\r\n\r\nLeonard will share this loan with her loan group \"Furaha Tegeta\", which has four members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1448977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He lives with his parents and siblings and has supported the home since he was born. Three years ago, when he finished high school, he started helping his father with household tasks. That is how all famers learn how to handle the capital to plant tubers and negotiate the harvest. But since he is a dynamic young man with a strong desire to move up in life, he convinced his father to sell the meat from small animals themselves, and now they have a space in the meat market together and sell their meat every day. \"Our business is going very well, especially because our animals are 100 percent natural and we raise them ourselves,\" Freddy said. Now he wants to expand his livestock and save for a college degree. This is his first loan with Kiva, and he is grateful for the financial support to help his business make progress. He promises to make his payments on time. Freddy plans to use the loan to purchase small animals to continue his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1452993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase small animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-18T03:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-17T03:30:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":554.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778369}],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T04:06:30Z","paid_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":621112,"name":"Primitiva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Primitiva, de 37 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada con Sergio, su esposo.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

In her spare time, she raises sheep and goats, which is one more additional source of income for her family.  Farida would like to make her new business work.  She sees herself as a successful businesswoman in the future and she doesn't want to stop the progress she has made.  To reach this goal, Farida needs money.

","en":"Shuhrat is 33 years old. He is married and is the father to a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter. Shahrat has a workshop for processing and grinding wheat to make flour. He started his business 10 years ago in his district of Hamadoni. In Hamadoni, many residents practice agriculture, including sowing wheat. The residents themselves are Shuhrat's raw material suppliers. Shuhrat has been very lucky as a businessman, as he does not have to go far for his raw materials or order them from another district. Shahrut's brother helps him with his business. Until now, they have been doing the processing by hand. Now Shuhrat is requesting a loan to purchase a special machine for flour grinding. He wants to order the milling machinery from the city of Dushanbe. This kind of equipment is very expensive, which is why he did not have enough money for it and requested a loan. Thanks to this machinery, work at the workshop will go much faster, the quality of the product (flour) will get better and their work shop will

","en":"Rahmat is 54 years old. He is married to Manzura and lives with his wife, daughter in law and grandson in the city of Khujand. Rahmat has spent 20 years working as an engineer for the city council. At the same time he also bred poultry. Now Rahmat wants to fulfil his long-held dream. He plans to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and work producing ropes. At the moment he is not working and is concentrating all his attention and strength on opening a profitable business in the trade just mentioned. With the money from a loan he plans to buy equipment to produce ropes. He will be helped in work in this field by experience gained from his grandfather. Rahmat has accumulated savings from poultry farming and he wants to spend this money, together with the loan, on the purchase of equipment because it is very expensive. Rahmat is absolutely determined to make this business work. He has already bought premises for a workshop and plans to hire two employees. Your help is absolutely essential for him! He awaits your
