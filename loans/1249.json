Sabira has higher education and works as a teacher in school. As an additional income for her family Sabira's family started animal husbandry with a purchase of livestock for 10,000 KGS right after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Because of her hard work Sabira now has one milk cow, one horse, one calf, one heifer and 28 sheep as well as a plot of land in the size of 2.40 hectares where she annually grows beans, potato and perennial grasses. Her monthly income is 13,000 som (KGS). With the goal to further grow her business Sabira has come to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 80,000 KGS to buy calves to increase the headcount of livestock. Sabira plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of livestock and also save money to repair her

capital city. His wife works as a hair stylist at the beauty salon and Iago is an operator at the petrol station. The couple gets monthly salaries and their income is $270.  \r\n\r\nAs the existing income is not big enough for the four-member family, Iago decided to earn additional income and purchase a second-hand car to use as a taxi. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Iago applied for the credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She lives with her husband and her son. To earn a living, Gohar is engaged in raising two pigs, and in cultivation of tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, alfalfa, and some fruits (peaches, apricots, plums, blood oranges and apples). Farming is the main source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nGohar's husband and son help her greatly in getting the agricultural produce to the local market. Gohar cultivates plants in two greenhouses. As their needs are growing day by day, she needs to enlarge her agricultural business a little bit, to meet the daily needs of her family more effectively. As this is Gogar's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history.  \r\n\r\nA loan of USD 2000 will be a huge support to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling them to build another greenhouse and to develop their agricultural business further. The family will be very thankful to all the lenders for their good will and support in collecting the needed amount of the loan to develop their business.

After the death of her husband, she raised their three children on her own, and also runs their homestead. Kulshayir has a higher education and works as a teacher in a local school. As a source of additional income for her family, Kulshayir is involved in raising livestock, having started 15 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Kulshayir today has on her homestead: two dairy cows, one horse, and one calf.

They are experienced in the field, and have a good approach towards business expansion and savings for future.\r\n\r\nBut for some time they face losses in their business, so Razia decided to apply for a loan to support her business, and therefore has requested a loan of  PKR 20,000 to purchase two more calves. They are confident and have good market knowledge to grow their business. They dream of providing better standard of living to the family members through all their hard work in business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1449124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is the mother of a family of three children, ages 12, 10 and 7. They study in the elementary school in the community where they live. Ana studied until the sixth grade in her community.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband of 13 years. He works making trips in a pick-up, from their community to the districts and villages of their community and to the city every day.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s aunt also lives in their home. Ana is the second out of four siblings, who live in the U.S.  Only she and her parents still live in their country.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she was very young, Ana has worked selling clothing, and her parents raised her in their clothing sales business. Currently, she sells clothes for children and adults in the community and in the adjoining villages. From Monday to Friday she also sells fruit in the community.  Sometimes on Sundays she sells bread and other snacks at the soccer field.\r\n\r\nShe buys her stock (clothing) twice a month, depending on the season. It takes an hour and a half to get to the place on a city bus.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she seeks from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy clothing for adults and children. She will invest $500 in this. From the remaining funds, she will buy $50 worth of fruit. She will invest the rest of the money in buying bread to go the soccer field and sell bread with beans and cream.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she hopes to achieve a larger income for her family, because right now the season in which there is a high demand for clothing is approaching.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to support her kids in their studies, because she didn\u2019t have that type of support to continue learning and to develop herself into a

","en":"Pablo is a 26 year-old farmer who has had to take care of his mother from a very young age.  His father died, and so he had to take over the responsibility of the household.  He is a farmer who raises and fattens animals and produces milk.  He has 27 pigs, 2 producing dairy cows, and 15 chickens.  He does this work on a rented farm where he lives with his mother and his little 4 year-old daughter.  In order to generate the resources he needs to support his family he sells pigs to various butcher shops, and he sells the chickens and milk to his neighbors in the municipality where he lives.  \r\n\r\nHis drive, dedication, and love for his family motivate him to get ahead, overcoming all of the difficulties and challenges that he is presented with.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The income from the activity is seasonal, and in order to generate a monthly income, Aleksandre is requesting a loan to purchase a milk cow and two calves.\r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved within the frame of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nAfter purchasing the livestock, Aleksandre will keep them in a shed located in his yard. His wife will produce dairy products with the received milk, and sell them from their house.\r\n\r\nThe calves will be raised, and after several months they will be sold for a good price. The new initiative will generate income and Aleksandre will be able to improve the standard of living for his family members.

To improve her living conditions and to earn some extra income she accessed a second loan. Now she is very much confident in running her business and has developed her business significantly. At present her monthly income is Rs.5,000 from her fish business which is still not sufficient to cater for the needs of her family. She has a dream to have fish wholesale business after getting a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe other three members named Baidehi, Basumati and China are doing seasonal business, a grocery shop and a fish business respectively. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1449273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Sergad, Kalahandi, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-18T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-17T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baidehi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandhya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"China","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":128000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":128000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T15:28:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":621127,"name":"Maruja","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maruja tiene 43 a\u00f1os  de edad es madre de tres hijos, ella vive en Punata una provincia de la ciudad de Cochabamba, vive junto a su esposo con quien trabaja todos los d\u00edas.\nMaruja se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de leche, ella cuenta con diez cabezas de ganado sacando una producci\u00f3n diaria de 120 litros diarios y de  los cuales realiza quesillos para poder vender en el Mercado de nuestra ciudad todos los d\u00edas y de la misma manera ella vende mote.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future, he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Their main work involves small-scale commerce and service (combs, hairbrushes, fish, footwear, and barbering). \r\n\r\nJustice (the male in the group) is the featured borrower of the group. He is 40 years old, married, and the father of three children (one girl and two boys). \r\n\r\nJustice has 11 years' experience in the hair-cutting (barbering) business. He needs a loan amount of GHS 500 to buy a barbering machine so that he can serve customers better. He could make a profit of GHS 300 per week, which would mean a quick turnover and repaying without trouble. \r\n\r\nThe profits from his business will be used to cover family-related expenses and saving the rest with ID-Ghana. \r\n\r\nThe group needs a total amount of GHS 2,650 to buy enough goods to sell to

Born into a family of singers in Madrid, Spain, Rebeca was immediately immersed in the rich musical language of flamenco. She began her public performances at the age of four, travelling through Spain and Britain, where she developed a passion for jazz.\n\nArriving in New York in 2000, Rebeca began collaborating and performing with the most sought-after musician of the Latin-Jazz scene.

hardworking woman of 32.  She is married and has two children.  Zebo has worked with Arvand since 2009 and is a responsible client who always makes her loan payments on time.  Zebo and her husband run their own livestock and agricultural business, but every time they make a profit, they have to spend all of the money on family necessities.  Zebo wants to expand their business in order to make more money to better satisfy the needs of her family.  She wants to purchase a few head of cattle to fatten and to sell.  She does not, however, have the financial resources to spend on the purchase of cattle.  Zebo therefore turned to Arvand for a loan to buy livestock.  Zebo is hoping for a positive outcome, and thanks Arvand in advance for their support.

She and her husband have a good cooperation and always help each other to ensure a high production from their cultivated land. They have been in this occupation for over 15 years. \r\n\r\nAs of now they are experiencing a bit of a sanitation issue, so she would like to have a loan amounting to 1,000 US dollars to build a latrine for the household.

for her to cope with her family expenses.  She is 37 years old and is the foster mother of 2 children.  She is a light in the lives of these children and is their only hope.  Seven years ago she started her own business purchasing and selling fabric in the local market.  She has her own trading stall in the local market and primarily sells fabric for sewing women's clothing because the demand is greater.  She needs to update her wares for the new season and get more clients because she needs to earn more money to provide for the orphans.  She is asking for a loan of 14,000 TJS to purchase fabric for the new season.  She awaits your kindness and hopes for your charity.  It is her dream that her children become educated people.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":1453419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

mother of six children. Her husband owns a fruit shop in a local market which is the only source of income for the family. He sells apples, bananas, oranges, but would like to offer a greater variety of items to his customers because this will help him increase his net income and savings. But due to a lack of money he finds doing this difficult. Therefore his wife HusanAra, who leads a two-person loan group, is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband buy a variety of fruits from local growers and sell them in the market at profitable price. With the profit he earns, her husband wants to grow his business in the future. HusanAra is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their

He started learning this work from his father at ten years of age. Since then, he has learned how to cultivate any variety of fruit tree, so he is eager to plant and see the fruits of his work. He made a living from this work because of a lack of opportunities for other work, whereas his crop is \u00bd kilometer from his house.\r\n\r\nThe loan requested from Fundaci\u00f3n CAMPO is to buy 15 sacks of fertilizer, foliar spray and labor for weeding. Jos\u00e9 doesn't spray poison on the mountain; he only clears the growth under his fruit trees with a machete. This is how he wants to finish harvesting 7,000 square meters of plantains, which are four months old.

I consider AUCA as the best university in my country and in the whole Central Asia, which gives a high qualified education. There were many departments to consider though. I wanted to choose any department related to math, because I am good at it. Basically I was thinking about two departments: Economics and Software Engineering. I stopped my choice on Software Engineering. I am sure that it will be interesting for me to study at the Software Engineering department and it will be able to make contribution for the benefit of our country. Another great opportunity that AUCA gives to all its students is a loan.

Their common objective is to get ahead and to provide their families with a promising future, while still preserving their culture and traditions. The women live in the city of Cuenca, known as Santa Ana de los Cuatro R\u00edos. Since December 1999 it has been a World Heritage Site. It has a cold climate and a beauty that charms everyone who visits.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Encarnaci\u00f3n. She is a founding member of the 'Sociedad 12 de Abril' loan group, and is very good friends with all of the group members, with whom she shares the responsibility for various group activities. She lives in a beautiful area of the city of Cuenca.\r\n\r\nEncarnaci\u00f3n is 79 years old. She has nine adult children from her marriage, some of whom are already married and live independently. Her unmarried children work and help her financially. She doesn't have a house of her own and rents her home. \r\n\r\nEncarnaci\u00f3n makes a living by selling fruits and vegetables in her area.

However due to the lack of income he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife Shahida as a member of a two-person lending group has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price.

She is a mother of two children. She adores her family and her husband works very hard so that his family can have a good and respectable life. Her husband owns an unstitched clothing business which is the only source of income for the family. Presently he needs additional capital for the growth of his business. For that Muqadas, as a member of a two-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell so that he can respond quickly to customer needs. With the help of the profit he will put aside some savings to pay for the electricity and gas bill. Muqadas hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business. She is thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1449810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The couple receives monthly retirement pension payments.  Lamara works at the local water company and Valiko is a welder, working on special projects from the house.  They work hard to cover food and every day costs.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate more income Lamara has decided to apply for a loan and restart a business trading household items among her community members.  Lamara used to trade linens and blankets nearly five years ago and has experience in this field.  With the loan she will travel to Turkey (neighboring country) and purchase a stock of merchandise for resale.  Clothing and household items are cheaper in Turkey than in Georgia and transportation costs are not expensive.

He is married and has to look after his five young children and old parents as well, but he hardly spends time with his family due to his business. He owns a spare parts shop in the area of Lahore, Pakistan; he sells spare parts for auto rickshaws. His shop is situated in the spare parts market and it is challenging for him to sell his products among his competitors, because in his area most of the people are likely to drive auto rickshaws by profession and need to replace depreciated parts from time to time. To cope with the competitors he has to maintain stock of each spare part so that he does not have to refuse any customers because the refusal of any demand makes a bad impression on customers and sales as well. \r\n\r\nNowadays, Younis is unable to buy inventory for his shop because he has been spending most of his income on household expenses. So he has requested a loan from Kiva field partner BRAC Pakistan so that he can buy all the important items including expensive and cheap spare parts.

The cousins belong to a large extended family where they share a big piece of land inherited through generations. Each one of them is married with school-going children, and has two acres of land to till for their sustenance.\r\n\r\nEmily is the elder one among them (second from right). She has four children in primary school, and she and her husband are farmers. Tea is their main source of income but they also grow maize, beans, potatoes, and vegetables for their food. They also have three dairy cows, a few goats, and traditional chicken for their food and milk as well. Income from tea and sale of milk is used for their family needs, and the little saving they put aside in the group account helps them get a credit from VEP.\r\n\r\nEmily and her cousins have been partnering with VEP with an aim of benefiting from the biogas project that will enable them to save money spent on buying charcoal and kerosene, while also saving them the time and energy spent collecting firewood. \r\n\r\nThey appreciate that their lives will improve by having biogases constructed for them since they will also have smoke-free kitchens. Emily is happy that with biogas, she can use the time previously used for collecting firewood, to have a family time.\r\n\r\nWith the biogas, her children and husband will be able to warm their food even in her absence without waiting for her to come and light the fire. This will make her work easier and her family will enjoy the convenience. \r\n\r\nBio-slurry will be an added advantage in that they will not have to buy fertilizer anymore. With this, there is no doubt their crop production will increase and this will ensure food security for her family.\r\n

He is a youth client of 22 years of age, who is married and has a child. Alaa is a hard-working and a well-known grocer.

He has long experience in this field and has gained his experience through working with his father ever since he was a child. In 2005, after gaining all of the needed experience, Alaa established his own independent business and has been providing for his family ever since.\r\n\r\nAlaa is applying for a youth loan of 3,000 USD.

The start-up loan program provides business start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Kristine and her husband will purchase flour and bran at wholesale prices and resell them for a profit. Kristine\u2019s husband will work as a salesperson because carrying sacks is a hard job for a woman.

and works at the community health center. He is the third born in a family of five and takes care of his parents and two siblings. \r\n\r\nJulius ventured into the retail trade in 2011 to trade in mobile phone accessories and general merchandise, since his employment income was not sufficient to take care of his extended family. He later partnered with a local telecommunications company to offer mobile money transfer services to the community from his shop. He has employed one shop attendant to coordinate the money transfer services and attend to customers in need of other products from the shop. The business has been doing well so far. \r\n\r\nIn response to the recurring costs and health effects associated with candles and paraffin lamps that are commonly used in the area, Julius introduced the solar lanterns from BrazAfric in the year 2012. Electricity is only available at shopping centers and therefore the products got a very good reception because of their economic and social benefits. They provide safe and bright lighting and come with a mobile phone charging function. Their demand has since gone up and now he cannot buy adequate stocks to meet the demand. \r\n\r\nJulius has been buying the lanterns for cash. From the Kiva financing option at BrazAfric, he is now seeking financing to purchase the solar lanterns for stocking and selling to the community. He has a good rapport with the area residents and predicts that, based on the economic and social benefits and previous performance, the solar lanterns will sell fast and boost his income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1449918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To buy solar lanterns.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"KAMBI MAWE-MAKUENI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":213,"posted_date":"2013-10-19T13:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-18T13:50:15Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":34974,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5829},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5829},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5829},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5829},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5829},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5829}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":5829,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-14T09:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6027.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449601996},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":5829,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-14T09:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6027.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067162},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":5829,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-14T09:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6027.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880134},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":5829,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-21T08:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6027.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479103761},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":5829,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-21T08:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6027.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490798903},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":5829,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-12T10:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6027.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504222027}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T15:46:48Z","paid_date":"2014-11-12T10:48:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":618945,"name":"Julijana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julijana lives in a minority community of Kosovo.

He has been a maize farmer for the past six years. With the loan, he would like to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase production. With profits from farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He had been working for a private company for a low salary and has now decided to open his own business doing the same work. In order to achieve this he is asking for a loan in order to purchase a machine and other construction materials he will need. The loan will help him to be able to start his business and generate a larger income than when he was working for a company.

With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

since 1980. \r\n\r\nHe is married and the father of 10 children, three of whom are still in school.

He is married with four children. He would like to use a Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Monthly income consists of 7,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her homestead, Nasimkan turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase her head count of cattle. \r\n\r\nNasimkan plans to invest income from the loan in further increasing her count of domestic livestock, and plans to save money for home repairs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1453446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Tuu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-19T17:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-18T17:30:01Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":86.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasimkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1141.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":311.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15140.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053384},{"amount":617.53,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":30280.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.97,"payment_id":529946903},{"amount":1060.15,"local_amount":55000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":55513.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":81.1,"payment_id":561578028}],"funded_date":"2013-10-27T06:36:05Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T10:50:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":619045,"name":"Immaculate","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Immaculate is a single mother of five children; none of her children goes to school.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business, so that in the future he will be able to acquire machines and tractors that would enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
