Elchin`s family started their business buying one cow and a calf with money they borrowed from their friends and some money they had been able to save up. <P>Later, they borrowed US$ 700 from Aqroinvest CU and purchased one milk cow.  Elchin repaid all his debts and his farm micro-business is going very well. But because of his father's illness, the money he gets from selling milk products is not enough to improve living conditions for their cattle.

Thi An is the owner of a general store. She is 45 years old and has been a member of the TYM Fund for 5 years. She has 6 children, 2 of whom are adults. Previously, her family's income came mainly from agriculture. After joining the Fund, she decided to invest in a general store. At first, she only had a small store with limited goods as she was new in the business. However, until now, she has expanded her store and added in a wide variety of goods to satisfy the local people's demand. Together with her family's income from agriculture, the income from the general store has improved her family's economy. This time, she would like to borrow 16,000,000VND (975USD) to invest in her general store.

Elvira is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Elvira from ASKI.

21-years old, is a daily worker in a bakery.

They live in an economically vulnerable situation and Fatmeh's status as a daily worker offers her limited revenues.\r\nShe is requesting a loan of  $300 to repay debts that she and her family owe four different persons, including money owed for food and plumbing. Fatmeh prefers to come to Al Majmoua to resolve her credit issues, because she wants to preserve her family's pride. She does not want the people of her community to look at her parents as if they are asking for charity. Fatmeh is part of a group loan with other women from the same village. They named their group \"Fatmeh\" because she was the one who had the idea of contacting our Institution. A group is usually constituted of self-chosen women, living in vulnerable conditions, mostly in rural areas. The group lending is based on incremental increase of loan amount and group solidarity to guarantee repayment. The strength of the group loan is that it encourages the collaboration approach in the borrowing community. It is a very powerful tool towards economic empowerment of women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":71943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To repay personal and family debts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Abbassieh - South","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2007-10-09T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmeh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-23T02:59:21Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T10:29:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79978},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-12-11T10:28:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":95462},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-01-11T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113933},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-02-11T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":133489},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-03-11T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":155785},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-04-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180057}],"funded_date":"2007-10-09T02:59:21Z","paid_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24335,"name":"Elisapeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisapeta\u2019s family has been engaged plantation work for some time now.

This is 37 year old Anitha S. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, between the ages of 5 and 9 years old. Anitha has been running a poultry business since 2002. Our client\u2019s business is Poultry\/kuku business. \r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\nShe works at the business for 8 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Anitha currently earns about 360USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy chicks and continue with poultry business. \r\nIn the future, she plans to expand her poultry business. \r\nAnitha thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Fotu is a 52-year-old woman living in the town of Auala.  She is married and has eight grown children.  To make a living, Sophie owns and operates a business planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables to sell.  Sophie has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately $78 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sophie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities.  Sophie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  That loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Sophie is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used again to purchase manure.  This will be her second loan from SPBD.  Sophie plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is 07.Hoang Thanh-Hoang Hoa (03.04.07.Hoang Hoa).\r\n\r\nThanh is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, Thanh owns & operates a business a food stall.

Thanh has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Thanh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Thanh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 5,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Thanh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  Luong T.

She also receives support from her husband as a driver. She\u2019s been in this business for almost a year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009 Bernadita joined PMPC to gain access to its financial services. She is an active member of PMPC under the PDP-LP program, a microfinance program that reaches out to rural communities. Bernadita successfully repaid a loan amount of 7,000 PHP. She is now requesting a loan, her third from PMPC, of 14,000 PHP to be used for additional capital to buy and sell pigs for butchering. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family, in particular to meet their basic needs, to save for the future, for loan repayments and for her children\u2019s education, insurance and possible expansion of her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Her greatest achievement is being independent and generating her own income.  She tells us that her biggest difficulty has been having a child with an ear infirmity which requires costly treatment.  For this reason, what the father earns is not enough for all the expenses, and she started to work a year ago selling food and beverages as well as providing photocopy and printing services.  She has managed to bid on a cafeteria lease within a school, the parochial school Santa Rosa de Viterbo.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Delsy also owns a mototaxi that she rents out to drivers as a form of transportation.  In the future Delsy plans on obtaining enough capital to buy a car and rent it out as a taxi.

This loan will be used for the purchase of more fabric for assembly-line style production during times of demand. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":332974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2009-06-10T16:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovanna Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":411.2},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":419.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":427.4},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":435.74},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":452.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":461.76},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":470.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":479.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":489.32},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":498.87},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":508.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.48},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.81},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":117.76,"local_amount":809.61,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":827.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52950250},{"amount":126.55,"local_amount":870,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":889.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63167188},{"amount":131.31,"local_amount":902.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":923.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592634},{"amount":136.26,"local_amount":936.8,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028006},{"amount":141.39,"local_amount":972.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T19:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":994.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939977},{"amount":72.76,"local_amount":500.12,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":511.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103781078},{"amount":73.97,"local_amount":508.6,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":520.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103781079}],"funded_date":"2009-06-12T03:17:23Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:14:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cyrus Maher","image":null}},{"id":118582,"name":"Fagbohun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"F. sells wine, drinks and juice in her shop.

It is for this reason that Alice is seeking a loan to strengthen her working capital.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":393227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy bags of charcoal for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-09-23T20:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896259},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735839},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623350},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020055},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858548},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618699},{"amount":29.66,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":13278.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.34,"payment_id":144652743},{"amount":20,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8852.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151834817},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575372},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":11065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953664}],"funded_date":"2009-09-24T03:10:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":143234,"name":"Nov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nov P., 37, is married and lives with her husband and two of her children in Takeo Province.

All her children go to school. She rents a one-room house where she lives with five people. Kasifa takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity and gets three meals a day, but has no piped water. She incurs transportation costs to and from shopping in Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Kampala city. \r\n<p>\r\nKasifa has a retail shop in Natete and sells all types of goods like salt, sugar, flour and soap. She pays rent of about $27 a month for her business premises and about $16 a month for her residence. She works in a semi-urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of twenty customers a day and sells to all categories of people.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer largest monthly expenses include feeding the family, school fees for her children and monthly rent for her business and her residence. Her major business challenges are seasonality and the rainy season which hinders her customers from reaching her.\r\n<p>\r\nKasifa has been in this business for four years and with MCDT for five years, now servicing her 10th loan and working with the same group mates. Kasifa joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more merchandise, like bags of sugar, cartons of salt and boxes of soap. She wants to see her business grow bigger and would like to start selling on a wholesale basis only.

C. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Bagacay, Sibonga, Cebu. She earns her living through her sari-sari (general) store  business.  Her husband Lito D. C., who is 33 years old, works as a conductor for the bus company to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 3 and 10 years old. Three of the children currently go to school. \r\n\r\nBrenda  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Brenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save for the future and for her children's education. Brenda D. C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband, Melquisedech, who is 50 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 16 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nPercilinda earns her living by operating two business ventures: accessories making and ready- to-wear clothes. \r\n\r\nPercilinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Percilinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, with which she intends to buy materials for accessories making so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nPercilinda A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

","en":"This group is called Aldama and is located in the community of Jantetelco, in the state of Morelos, Mexico. It has 5 women members who are neighbours and know each other. Maricela is going to buy blouses, trousers, shirts etc. with her loan. For their business, Ana Mar\u00eda, Irma and Francisca are going to buy catalogue beauty products to sell, and Luc\u00eda will buy tortillas, chicharrones (pork scratchings), cueritos (marinated pork rind), cheese, cream and vegetables for preparing food and selling snacks. Luc\u00eda is a member of the group and is 46 years old. She attended primary school until the 6th year and achieved her secondary education certificate in the INEA. She lives with her common law husband who works in the fields, and they have 2 children: Miguel \u00c1ngel is 22 years old and works, while Ana Miriam is 16 years old and is studying for her Bachilleres (high school qualification). Luc\u00eda runs a food business, and requested her loan in order to buy meat, tortillas, teleras (crusty bread rolls), pork scratchings, marinated pork skins, cheese, cream and vegetables with which to prepare snacks. Her business is opposite the 'Acuario' spa in Jantetelco and from her home she offers her customers tortas (crusty sandwich rolls), prepared pork scratchings, tostadas (topped crispy tortillas), dobladas (folded and stuffed tortillas), sweets and fruit cocktail. Luc\u00cda started her business 20 years ago with a loan provided to her, which she invested in stock. She learnt from her mother who used to sell food, and she used to help her prepare it. Her business is important because it allows her to pay the loan back, eat and provide what her daughter needs for school. She is proud of her business and enjoys preparing the food her mother taught her. When her sales are up, she saves the profits in Banco Azteca for emergencies or illness. She is planning to buy sweets to expand her business and she is hoping to do so with this loan. Her plans and hopes are to move forward through her work, and that her daughter continues studying. Group members would like to give Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad the following message: \"thank you for supporting us with this loan to invest in our business.

He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with decent salary. Hasan also has a grocery store that provides another source of income for his family.\r\n\r\nHasan is requesting a loan from FATEN to purchase more groceries to expand and improve his inventory. He will repay his loan on a monthly basis and will also use his profit to purchase more groceries to increase his income and improve his family's living conditions. Hasan is a conservative man, so his father Omar is photographed instead.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loans that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit this cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Yolanda is financially dependent on her daughter, who lives abroad. \r\n\r\nMore than a year ago, Yolanda wisely decided to open a small store in her home. She sells basic necessities to her neighbors and people passing through the neighborhood, taking advantage of her location on the main street through town.

In her first loan, she borrowed 2 million VND to invest in breeding pigs and poultry and profit almost 1.2 millions VND.  After searching around, she realized that putting money into producing wine also make big profit so that were the focus of later loan cycles.  Apart from selling wine to local area, the left over ingredient (after making the wine) can be used as food-stuff for their breeding pigs.  Hard work evidently paid off as her family's total earning monthly is about 3 millions VND.  She hope, with this next loan cycle of 10 millions VND, she could buy seed-rice for a cheap price to produce more wine.\r\n\r\n\t<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh H.

The city is well known for the sweets sold there.  The Rocafuerte group is very united, and the women get along very well with each other.  The day we interviewed  Sra.

Agustina is 46 years old and lives with her two small children (8 and 5 years) and their father.  She has a cafe style dining room in her home, a business she opened two months ago.  She sells cakes and starch bread each afternoon between 2pm and 7pm, in addition to serving lunch on Sundays.  Agustina previously raised chickens,but decided to change businesses, and so far this has been going very well.  Some days she sells everything she can produce.  Agustina lives in a well-travelled area near a bus stop, and since she moved her ovens outside she has had many more customers, brought in by the smells and sights.  She says she learned to cook by guessing, as no one every formally taught her.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Agustina is asking for a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR to buy tables and chairs to expand her business.  She is also thinking of buying another oven in order to produce more, and this costs $140 cash or $180 in payments. \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Agustina says that she has many dreams for the future, but the greatest is to have her own home (currently she and her family live in the home of her mother-in-law).  Her children are growing, and they want their own home.  They are already talking about buying the furniture. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Novesky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":363550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase tables and chairs to increase business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":103.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":413.62,"local_amount":413.62,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":413.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035127},{"amount":206.7,"local_amount":206.7,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":206.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947385},{"amount":101.59,"local_amount":101.59,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":101.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789226},{"amount":103.09,"local_amount":103.09,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":103.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789227}],"funded_date":"2009-09-02T00:01:26Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":130902,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia is forty-three years old.

Paraiso, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She operates two (2) business ventures:  a general store and a fish vending business. Her husband, Julius L., who is 33 years old, works as a driver and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children aged 8 and 9. \r\n\r\nRowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,200, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her store and fish to sell. She can then continue to save for the future expansion of her business. Rowena L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband, Policarpio, who is 45 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 5 and 11 years old.\n\nCarmen earns her living by operating two business ventures: ready-to-wear clothes sales and a rice business. \n\nCarmen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \n\nThis time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, with which she intends to purchase ready-to-wear products to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. \n\nCarmen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \n\nAbout NWTF: \nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married to Remigio who is a master builder. She lives in the company of her husband and their 19 and 12 year old children living comfortably in their own house. Maria's business is renting out rooms, which she has built in her own house, starting with a total of 4 rooms three years ago with a loan from MFP. They saw the economic need and, based on an idea of her husband's, they decided to start their business with only her dedicated to the care and collection of the rent. She likes her business since it doesn't take up too much time and the rest she can use for other activities as well as for the demand her rooms have by young students and single people so they are always occupied and she has a constant stream of income. Seeing this demand, she has plans to expand her business and build at least 3 additional rooms so she can earn more and maintain her spending needs for her old age. This will be her tenth loan with the MFP institution and she hope to continue with her objectives with this collaboration. She also notes that she feels good with her community bank since she considers the members to be good people. With the loan requested of 1500 new \"soles\" she will invest in the purchase of wood and strips to build at least 3 additional rooms."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":954372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wood and strips of wood for the building of more rooms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T04:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":163.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":173.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":168.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":185.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":192.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":194.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":207.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":215}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":163.03,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":168.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836368},{"amount":66.39,"local_amount":173.17,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":178.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246154},{"amount":64.62,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":174.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386170},{"amount":71.26,"local_amount":185.92,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":192.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099261},{"amount":73.93,"local_amount":192.85,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":199.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713411},{"amount":74.44,"local_amount":194.18,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":200.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202299},{"amount":79.45,"local_amount":207.28,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":214.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097980},{"amount":82.42,"local_amount":215,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":222.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400861}],"funded_date":"2011-12-24T15:21:59Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":377631,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Susana, se ha decidido por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo ya que en la actualidad no tiene la suficiente solvencia econ\u00f3mica para surtir al negocio, ella comprar\u00e1 insumos para la panader\u00eda como harina, aceite, manteca, az\u00facar, levadura, latas para hacer pan y clavijero, espera que esta nueva compra le ayude a mantener su negocio con un buen nivel de producci\u00f3n.\nElla considera haber tenido un efecto positivo con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior, ya que la buena administraci\u00f3n le permite haber mejorado su condici\u00f3n de vida y realizarle una mejora a su vivienda.\n","en":"Susana has decided on a new loan because she currently lacks economic solvency to stock her business.

Meanwhile, Nancy has started to sell large quantities of cosmetics by catalogue, a business that she's been running for around four years now. \r\n\r\nThey both intend to start up another \"Cebicheria\" in the future, once they have built a sturdy enough house and their road is asphalted.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Roden-Scott, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":294778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy cosmetics and herbal medicines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-29T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy, ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":165,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.5,"local_amount":47.61,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085005},{"amount":110.73,"local_amount":104.4,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-26T07:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":110.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439385},{"amount":13.77,"local_amount":12.99,"processed_date":"2009-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":13.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780247}],"funded_date":"2009-03-29T16:22:24Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Roden-Scott","image":null}},{"id":102230,"name":"Chu Thi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"L.

Julia is thirty-seven years old and married with three children who are nine, seven and three years old. Julia and her husband have a farm where they grow barley, potatoes, wheat and broad beans (\u201chabas\u201d). The potato harvest just ended, and they will soon harvest barley in June. \r\n\r\nJulia is requesting a loan to buy piglets and lambs. She isn\u2019t quite sure how many of each she will buy yet, but the money is enough to buy about four small pigs. She will fatten the animals up for several months and then sell them in the market in the town of Izcuchaca, the nearby transportation\/commerce hub. For example, if she buys a pig for $65, Julia says, she will be able to sell the same pig two months later for $85.

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian (many of whom recently emigrated from Haiti to the Dominican Republic) and Dominican clients. Her group is based in the outskirts of La Romana. Here she makes her home with her children in a structure of plywood with a tin roof which she owns but does not have title too.\r\n\r\nLucrecia originally came to Esperanza with the goal of starting a business and she has been with Esperanza for four loan cycles now, successfully repaying each time. With this new loan she continues to invest in her business of running a \"san\". A san is an operation in which several neighbors come together and put money into a collective each week for a predetermined amount of time and at the end of that time one member of the group receives a packet of goods. This is repeated until each member has had a turn receiving the packet. Thus it is a setup in which neighbors pool resources. In this case our associate is purchasing the goods to be given to each one of the members of her groups at the end of the cycle. She will collect a fee for providing the goods.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from this enterprise Lucrecia intends to invest in adding a concrete floor to her house (something which will greatly improve her living conditions and reduce exposure to disease) and to purchase glasses for her daughter to enable her to see. She thanks you all for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":393333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

I. is from the village of Villaverde, Iligan City. She is 47 years old. Rosalinda is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalinda owns and operates a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of fruits in the local market and to the local community members as well. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for more than seven years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalinda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rosalinda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow fifteen times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used almost all of the money borrowed as added capital for her business.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 11,000 loan. This amount will be used to expand her business by buying additional cosmetics for her increasing number of clients.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can help with the family\u2019s daily expenses and be able to let their children all finish their studies someday. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microminance loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":450913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional cosmetics.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Orlando B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nOrlando is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, he owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, planting and harvesting rice and corn for sale. He has been engaged in his business for over thirty-one years and earns approximately $117 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Orlando joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. \r\n\r\nOrlando is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be his 2nd loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas is one of the largest cities in Ecuador, with 500,000 inhabitants. But you'd never guess the size of the city from the tranquil pace of life. Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas is in a tropical, humid area of Ecuador, renowned for its natural beauty, its huge markets, and its trade in livestock -- the largest in the country.\r\n\r\nJuan is 48 years old and has three children. His two oldest, at 24 and 27 years old, no longer live with him. He lives with his 16-year-old son and his 42-year-old girlfriend, Mariana, who works in the house. His relatives have been ill, which has been hard for him, and Juan spends all of his spare time with his family.\r\n\r\nThis is Juan's first loan with Kiva. Juan is a general mechanic, and he will use it to buy tools and parts for his business.

She is the mother of a 37 year old son.  She lived in the town of Antioquia but because of the violence occurring in the East, she felt it was necessary to relocate to the city of Medell\u00edn approximately 15 years ago.  In 1996, she began her own business selling fried foods such as pies and empenadas (stuffed pastries) as well as soft drinks.  Later, the company responsible for managing the public space granted her a kiosk where she could work.  Since then, and after having been widowed, Mar\u00eda Josefa was able to get her son ahead in life. Her work day is from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm.  She needs to purchase inventory for her business such as soft drinks, snacks, cookies, and sweets.  With this loan, she will be able to increase sales and, in this way, improve her quality of life.  Her dream is to enlarge her store and have it outfitted with a better floor and additional seating.

Because it is one of the closest cities to the capital, it is a tourist area. These women work in different activities; three sell tortillas which they make and sell from home to others who use them to make desserts which are sold to the tourists  and go well with this product. The only one with a store is Ms Tania del Socorro. Celia is the group's coordinator. She was chosen because of her responsibility. She is 43 years old, and has learned her trade since she was young. She is the mother of 4 children, two of whom live with her. Her children assist in selling and in making tortillas. She says that through loans she has increased her sales as she has gained customers  and increased her profit margin while improving conditions in her shop. She has benefited from the Adin trainings, which have helped her to improve the appearance of her and of her business. She encourages the members of the group to make their payments and progress. She dreams of improving her home and of providing her children  with an education. Her husband helps her with the expenses of home, working as a craftsman in the neighboring town of Niquinohomo. She says \"The business, however, is mine.\"The group understands the need for prompt payment and unity to keep enjoying the benefits of these loans, as no other organization will lend without collateral, the reason for which they have never worked with loans in the past. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva
