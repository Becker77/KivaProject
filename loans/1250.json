She also sells milk to generate extra income. Her husband is employed in a textile mill but his income is not sufficient to meet the needs of his family. That is why Robina buys animals (baby goats and calves) at low prices, brings them up then sells them in the market at higher prices. She has gradually improved her business with support from the Kashf Foundation, and is requesting a loan for Rs. 35,000 to buy two more calves. This is her sixth loan and she has a good repayment history.

He is the only bread-winner in the family and supports his parents, wife and children by himself. \r\n\r\nEarlier Kamoljon provided a taxi service, driving people from one point of the city to another. However the work as a taxi driver in his region is variable and not promising. Therefore Kamoljon decided to start his own retail business, selling children's and women's shoes. He already rented a sales point at the central market. \r\n\r\nKamoljon needs a loan to purchase goods. He will buy winter shoes and sell them. We wish him good luck in his endeavors!

They live in their own house.  His personality is gentle, but his work shows his great capacity.  \r\n\r\nAt his age, he makes his living in agriculture, a tiring but comforting undertaking.  He grows potatoes in large quantities, primarily in the months of May, November and December.  \"In this area, mealy potatoes grow big and well, which is why their sale price is always good,\" he says.\r\n\r\nR\u00f3mulo began this activity when he was young, and later started his family.  Now, after many years' experience, he has learned to conduct other businesses, like selling mutton.  \r\n\r\nHe believes that the greatest investment is in purchasing fertilizers and paying personnel.  This is how R\u00f3mulo works and gets ahead.  He is very grateful for the help that is given to him and the trust.  This is why he is once again hoping for support to initiate another round of planting potatoes.  This is his third loan with Kiva, and he is very grateful for the financial support.  This will help him move his business forward.  Furthermore, he promises to be on time with his payments.  \r\n\r\nR\u00f3mulo will invest the 3000 soles in the purchase of organic compost to fertilize his planted fields of tubers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1452976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy organic compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-19T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-18T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romulo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778368}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T20:09:27Z","paid_date":"2014-01-29T09:44:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepa R.","image":null}},{"id":619080,"name":"Aemiliya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aemiliya is a student of AUCA's department of International and Comparative Politics. Below is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cEducation is an important aspect of life. Choosing the right college or university determines the quality of education. Good education affects future life. This issue must be approached very carefully.  Analyzing many universities of our country, I realized that AUCA is the perfect choice for me because it is one of the best universities in Central Asia. AUCA provides modern equipment that helps students during their studies. One of the important advantages of AUCA is that all the courses are taught in English. Another unique feature of this university is that students can choose their timetable suitable to them, as well as choose the most important academic classes. AUCA students have a chance to continue their studies abroad. \r\n\r\nI am a very sociable person and have lots of interests. I am interested in economics and politics, as well as journalism and psychology. That\u2019s why it was really difficult to choose one of those departments. Then I ended up with the department of International and Comparative Politics, because from the ancient times, different countries had political inter-relations. Therefore, international relations became more important in politics.  Another opportunity is that every student of AUCA can apply for a Kiva loan. Kiva loans help AUCA students to cover their tuition fees. I would also like to apply for a Kiva loan so that I don\u2019t have to think about the financial problems of a student\u2019s life.\u201d

She also takes care of additional family members (mother and father). She resides in a rented house, and the family has access to electricity and piped water. Her monthly expenses include rent and school fees. \r\n\r\nMadina has a  retail shop that she has operated for 10 years, working seven days a week.

She lives in her own home along with her husband and children.  Delmira works in agriculture.  She began many years ago with her parents and now works with her husband.  Their main products are beans, plantains and yucca. At harvest they take their products to the market for sale.  She has been working in this field for five years.  It was her mother who gave her the push to begin working in this field.  At first circumstances were difficult because bad weather made them lose their crop and they were left without any income or cash flow.  They had to start all over.  Thanks to God and to their hard work they have been able to move forward and have a stable business that generates income.  As an additional source of income Delmira works selling grilled foods in the afternoon from the sidewalk in front of her house. This is the first loan that she is requesting through Kiva.  She is very grateful for the economic support that she has received, and she promises to be punctual in her repayments and at group meetings.

Four of them go to school, and one helps them with the chores at home. Thus these are the people who depend on Jorge. \r\n\r\nHe works butchering pigs. He has done this work for two years. Earlier, he only bought and sold the pigs, but a friend taught him how to butcher them. He also does agricultural work in his free time, when the sale of pork is steady. He cultivates corn and beans. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from the Campo Foundation is to buy more pigs to butcher, and he will also buy chickens to fatten up. He is planning for the Christmas season, when they will be ready to butcher and he will be able to sell them. With the loan he will obtain more earnings for his family and thus get ahead. \r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have a pig and poultry farm, to sell the animals when they are grown, or to sell them to customers who want to buy them when they are small. In this way he would be able to provide jobs to friends who do not have work, because if they go out to sell the meat, that would be a source of income for other families.

","en":"Carla Patricia is an adult woman who is married with two young children. She is from one of the municipalities of Chinandega, a zone which is characterized by its commerce and is where one of the country's largest sugar factories is located. She sells general merchandise including a variety of styles of clothing for both children and adults such as purses, pants and shoes; cosmetics and shampoo; and other nicknacks. She sells from home or by foot, in which case she leaves very early from her home to distribute merchandise to her customers. She makes her purchases with cash at various markets and sells for either cash or credit both to returning and one-time customers.  Because she sells most of her merchandise by credit she has a very high turnover of goods.\r\n\r\nOne of Carla Patricia's dreams is to finish construction on her home, which will give her children a dignified place to live.

She started doing this five years ago, looking for a way to generate new income to raise her family's standard of living. It was her mother that suggested this field as she had lots of experience in selling food. Thus mother's helping hand initiated the business and little by little it grew and gained clients who liked the food. Shortly after Mar\u00eda suffered a great loss. Her mother died.

Blerim's work is very important to him as he is the only one in the family who has a job and is able to generate income. He is requesting a loan for the first time, in order to buy a cement machine and other supplies and construction materials needed to start his business.

She has worked at this enterprise together with her husband for three years thanks to the effort and care that they exerted to bring this hardware store into existence.

The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. So this loan is very important for Karine, to purchase a computer that she needs for her work. She awaits your

He is married with 4 children and lives with his family in a village in the countryside.   Everyone in his family loves to work hard and does their best to avoid being idle.  Ramazon himself works as a waterer on a dehkan farm, while his wife buys and sells dairy products.  His daughter is a seamstress who works from home, sewing clothes to order, and his son is a migrant worker in Russia, earning good money and sending some of it back to his parents each month to help with their living expenses.  \r\n\r\nRamazon also raises livestock for a living, selling their meat and milk at a local market.

Zoila also buys clothes in Lima that she then sells, as well as selling the items that she makes.  Zoila runs her business in a small space where she can display her products.  She runs the business out of her home, where her customers come and Zoila treats them with a friendly manner.  Zoila decided to start his work as she left her job and needed a trade in order to earn an income.  Her neighbours wanted her to do this work when they saw the good-quality clothing that Zoila produces.  However, due to her age, Zoila is now physically tired of being in the same position all day to sew.  As a result, she would like to use her profits to start a grocery store.

Kelly is divorced from the father of her now adult and independent children. Kelly lives in her own house.  She makes a living selling good-quality clothes.  She offers different kinds of items which are in fashion for men, women, and children.  She buys all the products when she travels to Lima and then sells them out of her niece's house.  She sells to neighbours and friends, who prefer to buy from Kelly as she treats them in a polite and friendly manner.  Her customers recommend her to their friends.  Kelly believes that her business is profitable, given the income she earns from it.  Her profits allow her to cover her costs and to pay for her son's education.  Kelly decided to start this business because she needed an income to cover her household costs - before she did not have enough to pay for necessities.  This will be Kelly's sixth loan with Kiva and so she hopes to have Kiva lenders' support to continue working towards her objectives.  Kelly tells us that she likes the communal bank's work because of the support that it provides, helping those who need it.  With this loan of 1000 Nuevo Soles Kelly will buy a variety of clothes, and sweets to sell in her house.  Kelly will look for good prices and so increase her profit margin.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1453794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes in bulk, and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-20T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-19T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":151.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":170.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":182.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.97,"local_amount":151.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":157.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905789},{"amount":59.61,"local_amount":158.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":164.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091777},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":158.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-30T09:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":164.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778384},{"amount":64.04,"local_amount":170.79,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":176.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598780},{"amount":66.44,"local_amount":177.15,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":183.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147677},{"amount":68.56,"local_amount":182.84,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-06T10:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":189.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240778}],"funded_date":"2013-10-22T00:15:03Z","paid_date":"2014-11-06T10:46:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":619427,"name":"Mwaka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwaka is asking for a loan because she believes that through it she will improve her business.\r\n\r\nThe previous loan enabled her to save money from her fruits and vegetables stall business.

Thanks to the first loan she asked for she was able to meet her goal of fortifying the soil and the crops by buying fertilizer, among other things. These helped her to be a part of a big development and be able to obtain an excellent corn and bean harvest. She hasn't been able to sell them because the market price is low. Today she is asking for a second loan to plant the back field so she can obtain a better harvest and wait for the market price to go up. This way, she will have a little more time and be able to wait for the market to rise and sell a part of the grains that have already been harvested and keep the other part to improve her earnings and invest in next year's crop. She hopes that she will be supported again so she can get ahead and at some time, have her own capital.

He is married and has four children. Zikirillo lives in the highlands together with his family, near the mountains. He loves nature very much, and the main part of his time he spends in nature. He also likes animals very much. Since his younger years, he helped his father breed and feed livestock.

Neyda's business is an ice cream shop. \n\nShe sells a very well-known, national brand of ice cream, in addition to fizzy drinks, water, juices, energy drinks and other beverages. \n\nShe makes most of her sales on the weekend as many people in the area meet up at some courts in front of her house to play sports. \n\nShe is asking for another loan as this is how she has always financed her business. Her profits served her for certain medical expenses since one of her children was sick. Part of her profits went to this emergency and the rest was invested back in the business. \n\nThis loan is to buy ice cream, fizzy drinks, water and other products to sell. \n\nShe has been with the communal bank since the beginning and likes it because the loans help her to keep on improving her business.

Also, in order to have money of her own and to help her husband with household expenses, she has run a small shop out of her house for ten years. During this time she has gradually expanded the business with bank loans which allowed her to add stationery etc. She hopes to continue expanding as she earns a good income from the store at certain times of the year. She works every day, and her son helps out occasionally. Marjorie enjoys her work as she earns money from it and she can still attend to the needs of her children as she is the owner.\r\n\r\nWith the loan money Marjorie plans to buy clothing and school supplies which sell well at this time of year.

As the salary of a construction worker is not enough to address the needs of his family, Ervand is also engaged in beekeeping and in the cultivation of wheat, barley, potatos, and garlic. He sells the agricultural products in the local market. \r\n\r\nErvand currently wants to start cattle breeding to cover the growing needs of his family more effectively. For this reason he needs a loan of USD 1,000 to purchase a cow. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to his hard work during recent times, Ervand was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. \r\n\r\nErvand and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1450932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to purchase a cow to start cattle-breeding","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Lernantsq village, Lori region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-10-20T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-19T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ervand","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":51.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55.98},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":57.61},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":57.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":58.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":59.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47,"local_amount":47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308636},{"amount":53,"local_amount":53,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845919},{"amount":51.71,"local_amount":51.71,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":51.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449735481},{"amount":53.15,"local_amount":53.15,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T09:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":53.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459214721},{"amount":108.27,"local_amount":108.27,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":108.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468039704},{"amount":686.87,"local_amount":686.87,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":686.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490953616}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T13:54:40Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T18:31:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":621720,"name":"Raul","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ra\u00fal vive en la comunidad de Huayllabamba en el distrito de Huancarani dentro de la provincia de Paucartambo del departamento  del Cusco, Per\u00fa.
