and is 59 years old.  She sews quilted folk blankets.  For a long time quilted blankets and pillows have been necessary household items of the Tajik people, and to this day they remain popular.  Quilted blankets are necessary items during the cold winter.  For many decades the Tajik people have used these blankets and they do not plan on giving them up for new synthetic blankets.  Salimakhon has been sewing blankets for about 9 years, and learned to sew from her mother.  Salimakhon sews the top parts of the blanket with beautiful fabrics so that winter won't be simply warm, but also pretty.  Each day new types of fabric and materials arrive in the city, and Salimakhon is asking for a loan to purchase beautiful fabric.  This will help her to find new and regular

He is married and has two children.  He lives with his father in his father's home.  He has helped his father with animal-husbandry and agriculture since he was young, and has a lot of experience.  His wife is a very hard-working woman and Egamberdi and his wife are engaged in the business of animal husbandry.  He purchases young calves, fattens them, and then sells milk and meat from the full-grown cattle.  Egamberdi makes good money in this business. He also grows and sells potatoes, and, though this is a seasonal business, it also brings in good money.  In 2012 Egamberdi partnered with Arvand and his wife says that since then their lives have changed for the better.

He has lived in Dilegarda village of F\u00fczuli region since childhood. His elderly parents don\u2019t work.\r\n\r\nIt was noted that Yasin is a driver, transporting people between various sides of the Fuzuli region for 4 years. His car is broken and he can\u2019t work. For this reason he applied to Kiva partner organization Komak to take a loan. With this loan he will repair his car. He needs 1,100 AZN to repair his car. He hopes that if his car will be repaired, he will start to work again.\r\n\r\nYasin thanks Komak and Kiva for help. In the future if the work is better, Yasin wants to purchase a new car."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1451113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":" to repair his car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Fuzuli region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":30,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Refugee"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.51,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T18:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":186.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429542968},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":93.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439761710},{"amount":118.76,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":93.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449666053},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":93.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459136611},{"amount":118.76,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":93.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467952281},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":93.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479173014},{"amount":118.29,"local_amount":91.31,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":92.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490867593},{"amount":119.22,"local_amount":92.03,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":93.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504294826},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":93.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517577667},{"amount":118.28,"local_amount":91.3,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":92.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530060907},{"amount":119.18,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":93.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542554171}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T00:45:32Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:06:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":619687,"name":"Saleh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saleh is a 30-year-old married man who lives with his wife.

She currently sells merchandise to her family, friends, and neighbors in the area where she lives.  She offers items such as jeans, tops, jackets, and t-shirts, among other things, and she uses the money she makes to help support her family.  She has been in this business for two years and she learned from a friend who does the same kind of work.  Her spirit of self-improvement and progress drive her to search for options that will allow her to keep moving forward, so she is requesting a loan to use to buy merchandise in bulk (tops, jeans, t-shirts, stockings).

She is trying her best to improve her quality of life and bolster her family's finances.  She is married and currently raising 4 children.  Her husband is a simple worker and does not make much money; his salary is not enough to provide the family with all the necessities of life.  For the sake of her family, Sarbiniso has decided to set up a new business; she wants to start her own farm, growing crops such as wheat, potatoes, and tomatoes among others.  With this goal in mind, she has taken a course organized by an association for businesswomen titled \"Attain Success\", and received a certificate upon completing the course.

They work hard to be able to earn a living for the family. \n\nThe family's agribusiness currently needs some investments.

However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Melsida was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \n\nSo she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

She is 30 years old. She was born in the city of Isfara. She is married and has three children. Her husband is a construction specialist and works on a by-order basis. As Khursheda does not have an education, she practices fattening up and reselling cattle. Her husband helps her, of course. Fattening up cattle brings good earnings to the family, which is why they are trying to develop this business. They have three children and Khursheda dreams that her children will study in good schools and will receive a higher education in the future. In order to achieve this, the parents do their best to work extremely hard. Currently, Khursheda is planning to buy several cattle to increase her herd. \r\n\r\nUnder the advice of acquaintances, she decided to fill out an application for a loan and turned to the Arvand microcredit organization.

","en":"Olmakhon is a 43-year-old married woman and mother to five children. She has three daughters and two sons. Olmakhon has practiced animal husbandry for 21 years of her life. She takes care of the cattle, cleans up after them, feeds them and milks them all by herself. Simultaneously, she and her family work on a communal farm where they cultivate crops including corn, cotton, onions, and alfalfa (feed for cattle). Undeniably, this difficult work does not come without rewards. Olmakhon is self-motivated, hardworking, and confidently pursues future goals.

The business grew out of the need to generate an income to contribute to the household economy because she was unemployed and her family was going through a difficult economic situation.  The chicken pens are situated outside the house where she lives and her parents support her in the job.  She learned the trade on her own and the business has taken hold little by little.

This will allow her to take advantage of the available space she has and be able to feed the chickens to meet the high demand for the Christmas season which is approaching.  She will be able to increase sales and income and thus care for her parents.  She can also strengthen her business and increase the number of chickens she has.

Gulnara has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Gulnara practices livestock breeding. She started this business 6 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 8,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulnara's hard work, she currently has on her farm: 1 milk cow, 1 horse and 12 sheep. She also works a 4 hectare plot of land on which she grows perennial grasses every year. Her monthly income is 3,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulnara turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle to increase the size of her herd. Gulnara plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

They all live together in Lluliana's parents-in-law's house.  Lluliana makes a living selling fish.  She has a stall in one of the town's busiest markets.  Fortunately she makes good sales and considerable profits but the work requires a lot of sacrifice: in order to find good, fresh products to offer to customers, Lluliana has to wake up early to go to the city's port at 4am.  However, she knows that her effort is worth the trouble and she sees the fruits of her labour when her children have everything they need.  Lluliana has had this business for eight years, and she works alongside her husband. Lluliana likes the freedom this business gives her, as she can have fun in the afternoon playing sports and being with her family.  Lluliana hopes to continue working in order to continue expanding her business and to have a greater variety of fish to offer her customers.  This is Lluliana's second Kiva loan and she is grateful for the opportunity and for the trust being put in her.  Lluliana promises to make her repayments on time.

","en":"Ismoilkhon is a 56-year-old farmer and family man. He was born in the village of Yangiobod in the region of Shahritus. To this day, Ismoilkhon still lives and works in that very village. Ismoilkhon had been taking out loans from local banks for about 10 years. But he discovered that through MLO Humo and Partners one can take out a loan at a low rate and over a short term. For that reason he turned to Humo to get a advantageous loan, in order to start his own new livestock-breeding business. Ismoilkhon plans to buy and sell cattle.

She is married and a housewife who works with her husband growing coffee and pineapples.

Her customers are travelers who travel between different parts of the country as her stall is located in a very strategic spot on the CA-5 which connects the north and south of the country.\r\n\r\nShe has spent more than 10 years in agriculture since it was her parents who taught her from a very young age, and who also left her a plot of land to work which she expanded through good administration of her earnings and strengthening it bit by bit. The land which she works with her husband is located 1km from her house which she walks to daily.\r\n\r\nHer aim is to be one of the best producers in the area, and obtain a good quality of product so that her customers become regulars and can always be trusted. As a mother she wants to give her son a good education and to strengthen their inheritance for their descendents so that they can face life in a positive way and can support their families. This is why she is now asking for a loan to strengthen their pineapple and coffee crops, buying the necessary supplies that will make her crops look better and avoid the spreading of diseases and infestations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1454569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizers, compost and urea for her crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T12:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T12:50:20Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maryori Nataly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":11.05,"local_amount":224.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:42Z","rounded_local_amount":226.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710592},{"amount":8.01,"local_amount":162.91,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":163.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517523922},{"amount":1405.94,"local_amount":28612.17,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":28755.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562417620}],"funded_date":"2013-10-31T19:39:17Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:25:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":622178,"name":"Mar\u00eda Erlinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 42 a\u00f1os, estudio hasta 5\u00b0 grado.

His cacao farm was recently pruned, so next year he is expecting an increase in his cacao yield. Evaristo states, \u201cWhen I pay workers, I am able to do other farm work.\u201d The Kiva loan has really helped him to get a lot of farm work done. Evaristo cultivates different farm crops such as cacao, corn, beans, pepitos, plantains, rice, etc. \r\n\r\nEvaristo\u2019s older children are in school. Cleaning is his major concern so he is requesting a loan to hire workers to assist him in cleaning the areas around his cacao trees. \r\n\r\nEvaristo\u2019s hope is to have his children take their education seriously and find a successful profession. Evaristo says that he would be grateful if they could become a farmer like him. So he provides them with a practical farm education but also provides them with the means to get an academic education. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1447118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To clean 4,500 cacao trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Antonio","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T17:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T17:30:07Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evaristo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":87.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202056},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T10:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":87.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673314},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":87.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144137},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":87.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467959986},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":87.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180767},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875364},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":87.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302573},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":87.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585356},{"amount":175.01,"local_amount":333.36,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":349.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530080938}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T19:24:58Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:20:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":622153,"name":"Dushigikire Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Pascal  fait partie du groupe Dushigikire   et  habite \u00e0 Bubanza.

But in order to feed her family, one salary of a teacher is not enough.  This is why Khursheda is additionally involved in her own business - she raises and sells livestock.  She has been working with Arvand since 2009.  She started her business with the first loan by purchasing livestock to raise.  At the present time, her income increased a lot and she is able to cover all of the family expenses.  Today she has 2 cows, 2 calves, one bull and 20 heads of sheep.  Khursheda says that once she started working with Arvand, her life changed for the better and she is grateful to Arvand for the financial support.

He is married and has two children.  He lives with his family in a small village, but the house where they live is not quite set up for a good living in it.  Gayrat's wife is a homemaker and a very hardworking and caring mother.  Gayrat works as a shoe repairman together with his father.  They have a shop for repairing shoes.

He is married and has two children.  He has a very friendly family.  They live in a rural area.  He tries to earn money somehow in order to provide income for the family.

He is full of strength and desire to work for the benefit of his family.  Boymakhmad is involved in farming and animal husbandry.  He has about 7 hectares of land, where he grows agricultural crops, such as wheat and cotton.  And his wife helps him with running the business by taking care and raising livestock.  Because their land is large, they also take livestock to pasture there.  The animal husbandry business yields a good income and this is why Boymakhmad wants to expand it by increasing livestock headcount.  This is why he came to Arvand to obtain a loan to buy livestock.

He is married to Lucy, a housekeeper, and is a father to his child. By the grace of God, Luisito has managed to support his child's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to continually send his child to school to finish his\/her degree.\r\n\r\nLuisito oversees operations of a jeepney (see note below) transportation business. The business has a jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which pays a boundary (daily quota) each day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new tires for the jeepney and to renew his registration. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nLuisito dreams that his business will continue to grow and hopes that his child will finish his\/her education. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week.\r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

She has carried out this work over the years to support her family. Every day she goes to the fields very early, where she begins maintenance tasks with the aim of obtaining a good yield at the end. \r\n\r\nShe began very young as she needed to support her children and offer them a good quality of life, attempting to school full time in the hope that they will become better people. She began working with the help of labourers for various tasks that she thought were complicated like pulling up the weeds. She has been lucky to rely on land that maintains her organic coffee and mullein in a good state so she manages to obtain reasonable harvests. One of her main objectives is to obtain better harvests supported with organic manure. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support that she is receiving to continue improving, as well as committing to making her repayments.

The market is a 15 minute walk from her home. She works alone as her daughters are studying and her husband works so they do not have time to help her.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy more clothing for men and children as she is lacking these and they are want her customers ask for the most, but also to display they at her market stall as two months ago they ran out of stock and have had to be ordered individually. Stocking these products will give her more income, as she will have the clothes the customers are looking for available.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a bigger store and a well stocked clothing business with lots of customers buying and going away satisfied with the stock. With the earnings she wants to continue supporting her daughters through their university courses and help them achieve their dreams to become professionals.

She is married to Paulino, with whom she had 4 children, all of which are older and independent.\r\n\r\nEpifania has a home of adobe where she lives only with her husband. She works in agriculture, and she plants products like cacoa, coffee, and barbasco [an inedible yam used in making synthetic hormones] among others. She has been doing this work for 35 years, and from the beginning, it has been her principle economic foundation, with which she managed to support her children economically. \r\n\r\nWhen Epifania started to develop this trade, she says that these crops were not in demand because they were located in the jungle, neglected by capital investments. However, with the passage of time, support from the state, and private companies, she has managed to increase her earnings like other farmers in the area, with the income from direct buyers and entitites that deal wholly with the capture of the region's net products.\r\n\r\nEpifania is pleased with her work, which she has done almost all her life, trying to obtain good quality products each season. One of her main objectives is to manage to construct her home with superior materials, which she hopes to leave as a legacy for her children in the benefit of her grandchildren who she loves very much. \r\n\r\nThis Epifania's second loan with Kiva, and she is very grateful for the financial support that she receives to keep going forward, and further, she promises to pay her dues on time.

She raises and sells chickens and has done so for five years, with help from her husband and daughter.  She has been raising small animals with her family from a young age, but it was a community project that started her raising chickens.  Because of cultural reasons, she only studied to the third grade and also worked on household chores.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to make and sell chickens through a community project.  Her husband has raised basic grains all his life and she saw the chance to support her family financially, so she started doing this kind of work.  This is how she gathered strength and now she has an established clientele.\r\n \r\nShe will use the money from this loan to increase her chicken production.  She has 300 and wants to increase her number for the upcoming season.  She will buy 150 one day old chicks, 2 quintals of concentrated feed for young birds, and five quintals of concentrated feed for older birds. \r\n\r\nIn the future she plans to have a farm with at least 1,000 chicks so she can deliver 100 chickens a day, to increase her market share and generate more income for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1453873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy chicks and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paula Emelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":39.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.09,"local_amount":38.09,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":38.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505296},{"amount":39.85,"local_amount":39.85,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":39.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716376},{"amount":38.19,"local_amount":38.19,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":38.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622004},{"amount":41.23,"local_amount":41.23,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":41.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088237},{"amount":339.37,"local_amount":339.37,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":339.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902497},{"amount":3.27,"local_amount":3.27,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215712}],"funded_date":"2013-10-22T01:36:54Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She is married to Carlos and has 2 small children with whom they live in an adobe house. She has worked in agricultural activities related to growing organic coffee and cacao since she was young.  She has been doing this for more than 8 years and has managed to develop it into a good source of income to provide for her family's economic needs. She thinks of her trade as peaceful work and at the same time it allows her to spend more time with her husband who gives her a lot of help. \r\n\r\nShe has the good fortune to have very fertile land which yields good production in spite of the fact that she has had to battle insect attacks which threatened her production.  Because of this she has to always be vigilant of her crops.

They have 3 children with whom they live in their adobe house. Flora is in agriculture, and farms the 2 acres that she bought with the help of her parents and her husband, hoping in this way to sustain herself economically. She began this work because since she was a little girl she helped her parents in the countryside and learned to cultivate the land. Having  family responsibility, she began together with her husband in this very profitable economic activity her her region. Since she began to obtain her first harvests, she has had the luck of having plots that sprout quality organic cocoa. To optimize her production she often uses organic fertilizer. One of the tasks she considers complicated is removing weeds as it is necessary to try to keep them from consuming the essential nutrients of her crops. It is for this reason that she hires seasonal workers to do periodic cleaning. At the end of the production season that lasts approximately a year, she brings her products in special sacks to the sale center of her town where she finally recuperates her investment. This is her second loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support that she receives to move forward. She also promises to make her payments in a punctual manner.

She has been stitching clothes for many years. She sews for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. She has thirteen years of experience in this field.

He's married; his wife does domestic chores and they currently don't have children. He lives with his wife and his mother.\r\n\r\nEmilio has been making tustacas (baked corn and cheese dough) and totopostes (baked corn tortilla) in his town for the past nine years. He learned this trade from a friend who owns this type of business and insisted that he help him, and then he learned it. Emilio also drives a few children to school on a minibus. He works on his tustacas and totopostes business from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. In addition, he drives the children to school from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. and picks them up and takes them home from noon to 1 p.m.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, Emilio will purchase a laptop computer so he can make good use of the internet and keep himself informed about the events going on around the world. One of the needs that will be fulfilled is that by using this computer and the internet, aside from being up-to-date he'll also seek more customers.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams regarding his tustacas business is to export to other countries, seek customers from other countries through the internet and get a larger clientele. Therefore he'll give his country a good name by exporting the delicious totopostes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1454731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married and has a child.  He lives with his family in a small village.  For now, they have to live in their parents' home.  Sherafkan wants, very much, to build a house for his own family.  Sherafkan's wife is a hardworking homemaker and a caring mother.  Sherafkan works as a carpenter.  This job provides a good income, however, it is not enough to cover extra expenses, such as building a new house.  This income is only enough to pay for the food expenses.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of his brothers, who work in Russia, Sherafkan was able to purchase a plot of land.  Now, he needs the financial means to buy all of the necessary building materials to build a house.  This is the reason why Sherafkan applied to Arvand for a loan to purchase building materials.  Sherafkan is hoping for a successful outcome and thanks Arvand, in advance, for their support.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1451226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials to build his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T01:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T01:20:05Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sherafkan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":342},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":353.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":366.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":379.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":392.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":406.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":420.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":435.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":450.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":466.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":482.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":505.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victor Khangulov","image":1437106}},{"id":619972,"name":"Genya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Genya is 56 years old and she lives in the village of Khashtarak which is in Tavush region.

They have four children, ages between 17 and 23. For the past 15 years now, Siah has been selling rice, pepper, oil, vita, etc. She started this business with a little money which she got from her husband's earnings. Siah says she enjoys the buying from her customers and the money she generates from her business every day. \r\n\r\nSiah is requesting a loan to purchase more rice, pepper, oil, vita, etc. for her business.

She is married and a mother of three children. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Bushra is one of the many Iraqi women who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nBushra has ten years of experience with the small, home-based sewing business activity, making custom-ordered dresses for women and children, as well as other small fabric household items. She would like to buy a new sewing machine and a small generator, both of which will allow her to work more comfortably, be able to better plan her work hours, instead of waiting for the government power, and create better quality products for her customers. To be able to afford the purchases, she is taking a small loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers 'group loans' for clients unable to provide a guarantor, thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

is a hard working and a kind man.  He is 32 years old, married and has two wonderful children.  Hasanboi loves his family very much and appreciates what he has.  Hasanboi's wife is a homemaker, who is raising their children and is helping her husband with housework.  Hasanboi loves the outdoors and he loves to work in a open field, in the fresh air.  He raises cattle, however, currently, he has only a few in number.  Hasanboi wants to increase their number.  He plans to use the winter to fatten them and then sell them by the springtime, but he does not have the financial means to do so.  This is the reason why he is applying for a loan.  Hasanboi is planning to use this loan to purchase a few additional cattle and to increase his herd.  In Hasanboi's words, he trusts Arvand and is hoping to receive support of this organization."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1451297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hasanboi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":153.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":158.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":163.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":169.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":175.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":180.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":187.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":193.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":206.81},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":211.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.56,"local_amount":153.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":155.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774428},{"amount":33.65,"local_amount":158.39,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":160.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673565},{"amount":34.8,"local_amount":163.76,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":165.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144355},{"amount":35.98,"local_amount":169.31,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":171.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960176},{"amount":37.2,"local_amount":175.05,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":177.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180939},{"amount":38.46,"local_amount":180.99,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":183.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875539},{"amount":39.76,"local_amount":187.12,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":189.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302766},{"amount":41.11,"local_amount":193.47,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":196.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585570},{"amount":42.51,"local_amount":200.03,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:08Z","rounded_local_amount":202.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081149},{"amount":43.95,"local_amount":206.81,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":209.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562029},{"amount":45.02,"local_amount":211.87,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":214.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694719}],"funded_date":"2013-10-30T17:52:15Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victor Khangulov","image":1437106}},{"id":619979,"name":"Dorris","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorris lives in New-Kru-Town, which is one of the oldest communities in Liberia.

Her children are out of high school and live at home. For the past 10 years, she has been operating a small table market where she sells spareribs, and pig's feet. She started this business by selling dried fish around her community with the small amount of goods she could afford. She learned this way of selling from her friends. She is requesting a loan to purchase spareribs and pig's feet for her business.

He is married and has three children, all who are currently in school. For the past five years, Hasan has been working hard to manage his boutique, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Hasan has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell, and will help Hasan generate greater profits, expand his business, and add additional types of clothes. Hasan hopes that in the future he will be able to produce quality products. \r\n\r\nHasan is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).
