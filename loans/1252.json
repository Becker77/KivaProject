Their clientele includes both men and women. \r\n\r\nThey are hoping to make a monthly average of 20 000 CFA francs, which will be spent on healthcare, food, school fees and reinvesting in their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1455629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy produce.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kancene","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa Ton       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kayata                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sambafini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minabalo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":83923.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972543},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83923.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625113},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83923.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851143},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":83923.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740773},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":83923.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220337},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83923.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045244}],"funded_date":"2013-10-22T16:19:36Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T16:39:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lucy  Knight","image":null}},{"id":620049,"name":"Weatha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Weatha lives in New Kru town, which is one of the oldest communities in Liberia.

Their clientele includes both men and women. \r\n\r\nThe group hope to make a monthly average of 50 000 CFA francs, which will be spent on healthcare, food, school fees and reinvesting in their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1455628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy produce.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kancene","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T12:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T12:10:01Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baoula           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakourou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakoro               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanataba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakourou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":558.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":558.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":558.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":558.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":558.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":558.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":558.33,"local_amount":266666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:55:02Z","rounded_local_amount":267756.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972544},{"amount":558.34,"local_amount":266666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":267756.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625114},{"amount":558.33,"local_amount":266666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":267756.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851144},{"amount":558.33,"local_amount":266666.67,"processed_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":267756.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740774},{"amount":558.34,"local_amount":266666.67,"processed_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":267756.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220338},{"amount":558.33,"local_amount":266666.65,"processed_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":267756.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045245}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T16:38:51Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T16:39:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lucy  Knight","image":null}},{"id":620060,"name":"Morcen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Morcen is 36-years-old and lives in West Point, which is one of the most populated and well-known markets in Montserrado county.

She stocks up in Tominian, and makes her sales in Kancene and in the neighboring markets at retail, for both cash and credit, to a customer base made up of both men and women.\r\n\r\nThe women hope to earn an average monthly profit of 20,000 francs CFA each, which will be used to take care of their health needs, food, and education costs, and the rest will be reinvested in their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1455644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kancene","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T12:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bana Sadia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Papa                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokoula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":75930.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972546},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":75931,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625116},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":75930.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851146},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":75930.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740776},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":75931,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220340},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":75930.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045247}],"funded_date":"2013-10-22T15:53:11Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T16:39:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Long Phillips","image":1429530}},{"id":620070,"name":"Finda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Finda is 37-years-old and lives in West Point, which is one of the most populated and well-known markets in Montserrado county.

Given the lack of work opportunities, and with a desire to generate income on her own, she wants to start her own business, making and selling cornbread.  This way she can take maximum advantage of the knowledge and experience she got from a previous employer and a training course she took.  Her initial idea is to set up an area in her home, so she can take advantage of the space.  This way she can still do all the housework and work at the same time.  She needs this loan to buy a grinder, supplies in quantity (corn and bags for packaging), advertise, and set up the space.  This way she will be able to start her project.  She expects good results and in this way she can help her husband with the household expenses.

The rest will be reinvested in her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1455660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase food supplies to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"T\u00e8n\u00e8","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Tata                                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Badji","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":210.71,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":101051.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625119},{"amount":210.72,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101051.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851150},{"amount":210.71,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":101051.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851151},{"amount":210.72,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":101051.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449740779},{"amount":210.71,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T09:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":101051.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220343},{"amount":210.72,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-21T09:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":101051.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045250},{"amount":210.71,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":101051.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263094}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T21:45:51Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T20:36:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":622334,"name":"Mar\u00eda Blanca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, a sus 62 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a trabajar en su propio negocio, una legumbrer\u00eda que inici\u00f3 hace varios a\u00f1os como una alternativa para aportar a la econom\u00eda de su hogar, pues su esposo era quien llevaba toda la carga econ\u00f3mica y supl\u00eda las necesidades tanto de ella, como de sus 3 hijos.

She had to walk 5km to school every day to arrive at school and so had to leave her house at 6am.  She took shortcuts through the villages and had to make the same journey home in the afternoon.  Silveria's husband has worked in agriculture since he was a child.  His father taught him to work hard.  He brings home an income to support the household.  The couple have children, who are studying and living at home.\r\n\r\nSilveria makes a living with a small chicken farm.  She has been doing this work for ten years, having started with a small project which was launched in the community.  When the project finished, she took out a loan in order to continue working.  Silveria has the chicken farm at her home and all the family helps with it, as much care is required with the chickens.  Beforehand, Silveria only worked in agriculture but now, while her husband works the land, Silveria looks after the chickens.\r\n\r\nSilveria is applying for a loan from \"Fundaci\u00f3n Campo\" in order to buy more chickens.  Graduation season and Christmas are approaching and at these times demand is high - Silveria needs to be ready.  Silveria will also buy chicken feed to look after the animals.  If Silveria buys in bulk she will save a little as the cost will be lower, and she will only have to make one trip - she must travel 20km to buy the chickens, and must pay for a taxi, as there is no public transport.\r\n\r\nIn the future Silveria would like to expand her farm and to work harder in order for her family to earn high profits.  She wants to see her children become professionals and very successful, and respected in the community.  Silveria also wants her children to learn to work so that, when they grow up, they can work in the community and earn a good life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1454944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

After having correctly paid back the previous farm loans, the women of the group BENKOLA are now on their first solidarity loan. \r\n\r\nDJENEBA, who is the first woman sitting from the left in the photo, intends to use her loan to purchase a 100-kg sack of peanuts.

After buying he goes home.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy 8 sacks of fertilizer to plant 17,500 square meters of sweet corn under irrigation and to finish helping  7,000 square meters of squash, which is already sprouting.  \r\n\r\nWith the investment he can avoid so much travel into the city to make his purchases, since he incurs costs and loses time. He will be able to manage his time and help his crops, which will result in having a better harvest and more income.\r\n\r\nJosue is planning on saving to give his children an education so they can graduate and have good jobs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1454961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 8 sacks of fertilizer to plant 17,500 square meters of sweet corn under irrigation and finish helping 7,000 square meters of squash, which is already sprouting.

She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts.  Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.  In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.  This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit

He does his agricultural work when he has a day off.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s asking for the loan to buy two dairy cows.  With the loan he\u2019ll be able to provide his children with education and he hopes to remodel his house because his children are growing and they need more space at home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1454999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two dairy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T18:20:05Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":49.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":53.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":54.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":57.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":58.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":60.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":62.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":70.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.47},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.32},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.49,"local_amount":102.49,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":102.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505311},{"amount":51.63,"local_amount":51.63,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":51.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716389},{"amount":55.98,"local_amount":55.98,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622015},{"amount":56.65,"local_amount":56.65,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":56.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088251},{"amount":59.29,"local_amount":59.29,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":59.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902508},{"amount":61.76,"local_amount":61.76,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":61.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215727},{"amount":312.2,"local_amount":312.2,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":312.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817103}],"funded_date":"2013-11-20T17:30:31Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:33:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":622416,"name":"Maria Edubina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada, tiene una hija mayor de edad y vive en una aldea del municipio de Santa B\u00e1rbara.

The idea arose from the need to generate income of his own for he was finding it difficult to find employment because of the high demand for jobs in the country.  Because of this, he opened a small store where he sells mobile phone accessories and rents movies.  He works alone every day of the week from 8am until 7pm.  He sells mobile phone accessories, air time recharges, chargers and also provides repair services.  He also rents movie DVDs earning enough money this way to contribute to household support.\r\n\r\nJuan learned the activity from a family member who taught him how to manage in business especially in the mobile phone area.  His business has had good results and his sales have gradually increased.  This motivates him to continue seeking alternatives to continue making progress.\r\n\r\nThis is why he\u2019s requesting his 7th loan that he will use to buy a display case and merchandise at wholesale (mobile phones, movies, chargers, screen protectors, cases, etc.) in order to better display his goods and to have a more varied inventory of products on-hand to satisfy his customers\u2019 needs and wants which will lead to a significant increase in sales and in income generated by them.\r\n\r\nWith his warrior spirit and enthusiasm, Juan intends to continue strengthening his small business and dreams with acquiring a larger locale to expand the business and combine it with an Internet caf\u00e9 to provide an integrated service in the same place succeeding in attracting more customers improving his income to provide better quality of life for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1455078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a display case and merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Caldas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Pablo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":107541},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":110521},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":113584},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":116731},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":119966},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":123290},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":126707},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":130218},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133826},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137534},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":141345},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":145262},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":149287},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":153424},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":157675},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":162045},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166535},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":171150},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":175892},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":180766},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":185775},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":190926}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":620304,"name":"Melodina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melodina works hard to support her family.

However, the income that she gets is very small and is not enough to meet the needs of her family. Aida is also engaged in breeding livestock of cows and piglets to earn a living for the family. She cultivates tomatoes and grapes as well. Farming is the most important source of income for the family. Aida currently needs a loan of USD 1500 to purchase one cow, and some forage for the livestock. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Aida was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Aida will be thankful to all the lenders for helping her to collect the needed loan and sustain her agribusiness.

The family is also engaged in breeding a livestock of cows and pigs, in the cultivation of sunflowers and several fruits (cherry, grape, apple and pear). Hovhannes currently needs a loan of USD 3000 to purchase some necessary materials for the cultivation of grapes (pipes, stones, sand and soil). He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Hovhannes was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a poor credit history and have no access to credit products. Hovhannes and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1451940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase some necessary materials for cultivation of grapes (pipes, stones, sand and soil)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Shenavan village, Armavir region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T20:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T20:40:11Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hovhannes","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":101.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":113.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":116.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":116.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":119.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":119.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":123.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":122.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":122.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":126.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":128.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":130.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":132.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":134.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":135.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":136.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":137.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Georgia Murphy","image":1343751}},{"id":620355,"name":"Nzingo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nzingo is married and has six children, all of whom go to school.

She is asking for a loan to buy inventory in quantity (dairy, meats, toiletries, pastries, sweets, soft drinks).  This way she can expand her inventory of products and satisfy her family needs.  This will allow her to increase her sales and income.  This is how Luz wants to continue strengthening her business, growing it little by little, and get ahead with her husband and two children.  She will also be able to offer them a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1454841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"La Estrella","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T20:50:08Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Dary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71384},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":73362},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75395},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":77484},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":79631},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81837},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":86436},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88831},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91292},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":93822},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96421}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.67,"local_amount":144846,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":150207.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074746},{"amount":41.48,"local_amount":75423,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":78214.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009941},{"amount":86.34,"local_amount":156987,"processed_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":162797.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523555},{"amount":45.13,"local_amount":82054,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":85091.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227265},{"amount":17.38,"local_amount":31604,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":32773.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480244928},{"amount":28.94,"local_amount":52617,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":54564.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855680},{"amount":47.6,"local_amount":86553,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":89756.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520982802},{"amount":48.94,"local_amount":88983,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":92276.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531789550},{"amount":132.1,"local_amount":280933,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":291331.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.42,"payment_id":595189754}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T01:02:15Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:37:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Over the past 15 years she has sold merchandise, and some time ago she was able to acquire a small showcase to display her products on the sidewalk in front of her home. In this way she has been able to generate the financial resources to raise her son and still keep up with her household chores. \r\n\r\nShe is known as a strong, kind, and charismatic person who always looks for new ways to get ahead, and it is for this reason that she is applying for her first loan.  She will use it to buy wholesale merchandise (sandals, hair accessories, earrings, bracelets, rings, etc.) and thereby increase the variety of her inventory to meet the increasing demand during the coming holiday season.  This will allow her to generate more income and continue to pay her household bills.  Additionally, Luz hopes to fulfill her dream of opening a large, well-stocked shop, known in her area. This will allow her to provide her son with better living conditions and an improved sense of well-being.  He is her main motivation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1455111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Mukaddas has been working at a school for several years.  Her husband has a small income and cannot provide their three children with all of the necessities.  The children require more comforts year-after-year because they are developing in step with the developing world.  Mukaddas decided to organize a business in buying and selling dried fruit.  She searched for help for a long time and finally learned about the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association of Business Women.  She participated in this course and got a lot of positives for herself.  She obtained a certificate after completing this course.  Now she is ready to start her business, but does not have money to buy dried fruit.  She will sell it at a local market.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of 4000 somoni to buy dried fruit.  She awaits your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1454291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

","en":"Mahliyo was born in 1986.  She is divorced and has two children.  Her children are still small.  The oldest son is 7 years old and the youngest is 3.  Mahliyo got divorced three years ago.  She is the sole provider for her children because her husband is not helping her with providing for the children.  She works hard from early morning to late evening to earn money and feed her children.  She has been involved in her own business for over 8 years.  She provides seamstress services.

He is from the village of Qubadiyon. He is married and has children. Muzaffar takes a loan to start his own business of fattening and selling cattle. He is a prudent man and he has a plan for everything, including his future business.\r\n\r\nMuzaffar will purchase small calves at the local market.

Her business consists of selling second-hand clothing. She says her biggest challenge so far in her business has been the seasonality of supply from vendors, which causes drastic changes in prices. With this next loan, she will be able to buy in bulk, which will allow her to get through those tough times of low supply without having to pay the extra high prices.

She joined the group Progreso y Conciliacion  1.1, in one of the rural villages in San Pedro de Macoris, where she has received 14 loans to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International is running a program where most of their clients pay back their loans, fulfill the commitment to expand their businesses and show fidelity in their groups. They can request loans to improve their homes while running their businesses and attending groups meetings.\r\n\r\nEludina is living in a rural town with her three children. She is a widow and mother. She started building her house with the family savings and with the help of this loan, she will finish building her roof, covering her home walls with cement and painting them while the other member, Maritza, will build her home in parts. First, she is taking this loan to buy concrete blocks, cements, rods and other building materials to build 50% of her home structure from wood to concrete blocks. She will change her old zinc roof. Both members request a housing loan for their home improvement. Eludina and Maritza thank you all for your

His business is a general store, selling many different items including drinks, flour, sugar, and other food items. He says his biggest challenge so far is the inconsistency of his suppliers. Often, when he goes to restock his store, the supplier does not have any inventory available for sale. With this next loan, he will be able to buy more of each of these items to further grow his inventory. By buying in bulk, he will be able to continue to work through those periods when his supplier is out of inventory. Basile hopes to continue to grow and diversify his store in the future. With future profits, he dreams of one day building his own home. He also wants to teach his children the business so they can one day have a business of their own.

","en":"The pretty woman in the photo is Shahzoda. She is 46 years old. She is the mother of two children and a faithful wife. Her husband is working abroad. Her son is also out of the country. She lives in the city of Dushanbe with her daughter. Her daughter is studying at the university. Shahzoda is a housewife and most her time she spends alone at home. Therefore, Shahzoda decided not to just sit around, and she opened a grocery store near her house. She built a small room, and the only thing left is to finish the interior and to buy food. She doesn't have enough money to make repairs and buy goods. Shahzoda believes that people will patronize her shop, and it will not only give her something to do, but will also allow her to contribute to the family

She was born into a family of farmers and miners and all her life has been spent in the country. Since she was a child, her father taught her all about agricultural work. While he was working as a day laborer, she cared for the animals at home. Thanks to this, today she makes her living breeding and raising chickens, an activity she alternates with work in the home and the care of her family which consists of her husband and 2 small children. At 25 years of age, she wishes to start another productive project in order to generate sufficient resources to support her husband with the economic burdens of the household. Therefore, she is requesting a loan to buy 10 pigs for breeding, fix up the space in the pens, and to buy food pellets to feed the animals. This will allow her to launch her idea and she will be able to keep an eye on her family while caring for the animals. Also, she sees this activity as a good source of income initially because the Christmas season approaches when it is customary that the demand for this meat will increase. On the other hand, it is a very affordable meat so during the rest of the year the families of Antioquia prefer to consume it which, for her, would be an advantage to be seized. Maria knows that to achieve her goals with this activity she should work steadily, with discipline, commitment, and love and only then will she be able to fulfill the dream of strengthening her business and give her children a good education and improve the quality of life for all her family.

For four years she has worked in her own business, a bakery and cafeteria.  She was motivated to start this business by one of her daughters who has a similar business in a city on the Pacific coast.  She taught her everything related to running this type of business.  She also instructed her in the preparation of the bakery products.  She initially started working with one of her other daughters.  However, due to a serious illness that struck her, she died a little while ago.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with the help and the love of her other children, she knew how to endure the situation.  Little by little she mourned her loss.  Now, another one of her daughters has assumed the challenge and trained in the preparation of breads and other bakery products and pastries.  They are working in order to get her business ahead.  The business generates enough resources to help her husband with the financial responsibility of the household.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all of the adversities and difficulties that she has experienced, her drive, tenacity, and desire to progress prompt her to request the loan.  She will use the loan to make improvements in order to expand her place.  She currently only has one table, three chairs, and a small wall where her customers sit.  This will allow her to have the chance to provide better service and comfort to her visitors.  To her this means receiving better income for her family.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda dreams of strengthening and accrediting her business, of positioning herself in the area, and of being able to have a bigger and more comfortable place for her customers.  This will give her the chance to have a better quality of life and of enjoy a better well-being with the people she loves.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1455413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She has six stations set up to offer internet services. She got this idea because of her need to make money to pay her basic household expenses while looking after her young son at the same time. \r\n\r\nSandra works alone from Monday to Sunday from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm. She seeks to make the most of her time and to generate more income every day. Her drive, dedication and desire to excel push her to seek out options that will let her continue moving forward. For this reason, and because she's motivated to support her baby, she is requesting this loan to buy more computers.
