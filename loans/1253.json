Safarmoh takes care of and watches the cattle. In their yard they now have one cow with a calf. You can see this cow in the photograph.\r\n\r\nEven during her childhood, when she was living at home with her parents, Safarmoh fed and milked cows. This is why she knows a lot about the animal husbandry business. In the future, Safarmoh would like to expand her barnyard. But now, she is in a hurry to increase the size of her herd, which is why she is requesting a loan to buy two cows. She hopes that they will be the start of the advancement of her business.

Her husband is an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) and she spends most of her time raising livestock to help finance her family's growing needs while at the same time, showing her motherly love and teaching responsibilities to their children.\r\n\r\nShe has been in the hog-raising business for 30 years. Initially, she started it with just a small and weak pigpen located in their backyard. Now, Cheryl has established a concrete pigpen and has been able to grow it according to her plan.

He works as a ranch hand in a farm near his house and currently lives with his partner. They have been together for 2 years and have a 1-year-old son. Alexis has been working as a ranch hand for more than 6 years. He learnt the business of looking after a farm at home from his father who has always liked to keep animals. He worked alongside his father looking after and milking the cows that they had. Since he wasn't going to school he helped his father with the farm work from a young age and so learnt the ways of looking after animals.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to repair his house, which is made of adobe and is being washed away by the rain. He needs the money to buy 20 bags of cement, bricks and a lorryload of sand and the rest is to pay for labour.\r\n\r\nHis first big dream is to repair his house and thanks to the loan he is being given he will be able to fulfil this dream. After that his plans for the future are for his family to have better living conditions and not have to go without anything in the home. He hopes his son will be able to study, as he was unable to do, and he wants his son and future children to better themselves and get on in life with a university degree.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1455798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Thanks to this his main source of income is now rearing and fattening pigs, a business which he started as a means of generating an income to cover his household's basic needs. He started out with just a few pigs and gradually his production increased along with his personal income. Manuel is a strong, hard-working and active man who is always looking for new alternatives which will allow him to continue making progress. \r\n\r\nFor this reason he is asking for the loan which he will use to buy more piglets and concentrated feed for feeding the animals. This will enable him to increase his production and have enough animals available to meet the increased demand of the Christmas season which is approaching. This will mean an increase in his personal income. \r\n\r\nManuel wants to continue working hard in order to achieve a profitable business so he can enjoy better living conditions and wellbeing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1455807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He currently lives in a well-built house which was left to him by his parents. When he was 19 he succeeded in buying land and since then he has grown organic cocoa plants there.\r\n\r\nHe now has ten years of experience doing this work. At the beginning it wasn\u2019t easy to do the work all by himself as he didn\u2019t have enough money to hire laborers to help him with the complex tasks.\r\n\r\nGrover feels very committed to this kind of work as he has been doing it with responsibility and dedication ever since he was a young man. He greatly enjoys stripping the pods from the cocoa plants after the harvest as he can do this with great skill.

Legend has it that this town was formerly called El Idolo.  When the Spanish conquerors came, they rested here for a while.  When they moved on, in gratitude to the people of the town, they left a sculpture of San Jos\u00e9.  The people then changed the name of the town to San Jos\u00e9 El Idolo (Saint Joseph The Idol). \n \nThe women of this group have businesses that include selling food, wood, clothing or household goods.  There is also a dressmaker and a small store.  These are poor women with a great desire to better their lives and the lives of their families.  They now have the opportunity to do this by upgrading their businesses and increasing their profits with the help of Namaste\u2019s business advisors and money management classes.\n\nAngela (3rd from left) is 64 and does not know how to read or write.  She has a life partner but she is the only one contributing to the house and business.  She has had her store for about ten years.  Unfortunately, four years ago a car ran over her leg and she almost lost her foot.  She was not able to work for two years, during which time her partner took care of the store for her.  However, without her guidance the store did not do as well and her profits went way down.  With her loan, she wants to buy what she needs to stock her store with things her customers want.  She can then bring her sales to the level where she had them before the accident.  She currently has a monthly profit of around US $117, working 140 hours a month.  She believes that if she can provide the items her customers need, she will increase her profits to about US $247.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1447147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to increase her store's stock back up to where it was before her accident.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Jos\u00e9 El Idolo, Suchitep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-10-23T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-22T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daira Medarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":113.89,"local_amount":888.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":906.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419860876},{"amount":113.89,"local_amount":888.93,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":906.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509413},{"amount":113.85,"local_amount":888.59,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":906.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733265},{"amount":113.98,"local_amount":889.59,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":907.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449639186},{"amount":113.84,"local_amount":888.61,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":906.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459105540},{"amount":113.88,"local_amount":888.93,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":906.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467920416},{"amount":113.89,"local_amount":888.93,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":906.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479141186},{"amount":113.89,"local_amount":888.61,"processed_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":906.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490835103},{"amount":113.89,"local_amount":888.88,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-26T09:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":906.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543548}],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T03:02:10Z","paid_date":"2014-08-26T09:16:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":620743,"name":"Mesrob","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mesrob lives in the village Artsvanik, which is the most beautiful village in Syunik region, with its rich nature, sunny people and sweet harvests.

Her children are all grown up and live separately.  Anarkul has specialized secondary education and works as an instructor at a medical college.  To supplement her family's income, Anarkul raises livestock.  She started this business 20 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 3,000 KGS.  Thanks to Anarkul's hard work, she now has 3 milking cows and 10 sheep.

After the death of her husband, she has been raising their 4 children and running the household on her own.  Churek has secondary specialized education.  Her family's main source of income is raising of livestock, a business that she started 10 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 5,000 KGS.  Thanks to Churek's hard work, her household now has two milking cows and one horse.  Her son supplements the income by working abroad, in Russia, as a translator.  Her entire monthly income is 15,000 KGS.  \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Churek applied to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 130,000 KGS, to purchase calves.  Churek plans to re-invest some of the profits back into her business by purchasing additional livestock and save the rest with the goal of improving her childrens' financial situations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1455498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Rovnoe village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-23T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-22T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":195.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Churek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":32500},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":32500},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":32500},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":32500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":32768.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053387},{"amount":625.79,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":32768.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":49.21,"payment_id":561578031},{"amount":1203.61,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":65537.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":146.39,"payment_id":595435869}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T00:57:13Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victor Khangulov","image":1437106}},{"id":620786,"name":"Bernarda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernarda is 61 years old and married, with five children. \r\n\r\nBernarda is in the agricultural business, buying and selling livestock in the Philippines.

The group was identified by Junior Achievement and they are currently undergoing an entrepreneurship program with the objective of building their capacity to grow and expand their businesses. Through market research the group has seen the opportunity for selling eggs and chickens in the community and have already constructed a brooder for their venture.

Trabaja solo todos los d\u00edas de la semana, pero en algunos d\u00edas del mes, debe contratar a una persona que le colabore. El cliente es un hombre trabajador y pujante, con el \u00e1nimo de superarse d\u00eda a d\u00eda busca nuevas opciones que le permitan hacerlo, por eso se motiva a solicitar el pr\u00e9stamo, pues desea comprar surtido al por mayor (gaseosas, mecato, galleter\u00eda, jugos, caf\u00e9, confiter\u00eda, entre otros), as\u00ed se abastecer\u00e1 para la temporada de navidad que se aproxima, tiempo en el que las vitrinas deben estar bien surtidas para satisfacer la alta demanda de sus clientes.  Luis dice que quiere seguir trabajando aunque su labor es muy esclavizante, pero lo motiva las ganas que tiene de cumplir el sue\u00f1o de tener su casa propia, para mejorar sus condiciones de vida y bienestar.","en":"For about ten years Luis has been working independently in his own business.  Initially he set up a small snack bar but as time passed his clientele started requesting new products which has led to his business\u2019 growth to what it\u2019s become today.  \r\n\r\nHe works alone every day of the week but on some days of the month hires a helper.  He\u2019s a hardworking, driven man who very much wants to improve every day and seeks ways to do so.  This is what motivates him to seek the loan because he wants to buy stock (soft-drinks, packaged snacks, cookies and crackers, juices, coffee, sweets, etc.) at wholesale to stock up for the approaching Christmas season when display cases need to be well-stocked to meet customer demand.\r\n\r\nLuis says that he wants to continue working even though his work is very demanding but he want to continue motivated by his wish to reach his dream of owning a house to improve his living conditions and well-being.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1455897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Job

This is 34-year-old Grace from Mutare. She is married with two children and one is attending school. She also cares for one other dependent. Grace runs a sewing business producing wedding gowns. The business has been in operation for seven years.

So Muhayo came to the CSC MDO IMON International office and asked for a loan to buy furniture because she does not have normal furniture in her house. She is asking for a loan in the amount of TJS 3,000 (somoni). She awaits your support.

Abdurahmonjon worked in Russia for nearly two years. Nine months ago, he returned to his hometown, Yavan. He has a car, but he can't use it to make a living because it is broken. He needs $500 to repair it. For him, it is a huge amount of money, but he will have to repair the car to start earning. Therefore, he is asking for that loan amount. The only solution Abdurahmonjon sees to his unemployment is driving a taxi. He plans to carry passengers from the village of Yavan to the city of Dushanbe and back again. He will spend a lot of time on the road, but he likes this kind of work. The taxi will be Abdurahmonjon's only source of income. He is asking you to help! He is looking forward to your kindness and

It's located in the city centre.\r\n\r\nLincoln originally started out by selling belts, but he decided to change products because of the stiff competition that he faced. He purchased a surplus of video-game movies, and then gradually started to introduce music videos and game consoles into his stock. He begins work at 9:00 am and works from Monday to Saturday. This is how he generates enough income to support his family, which consists of his spouse and their two children. In addition, with a lot of effort and organization, he was able to get enough money to buy some properties, which provide him with additional income by way of rental payments.\r\n\r\nHis drive and dedication have helped him to get ahead. For this reason he is always seeking out new alternatives to continue moving forward, such as the opportunity that the loan he is requesting will provide. He will use the loan to buy wholesale stock (video-game movies and music videos) in order to stock up for the impending holiday season, when demand for entertainment items goes up. Lincoln's earnings also increase significantly toward the end of the year, which benefits his whole family and gives him the opportunity to offer them better living conditions and

This is 48-year-old Fadzai from Harare. She is married with three children, one is attending school. She also cares for one additional dependent.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe opportunity to study at AUCA means the world to me. I have an ability to not only perform what is expected of me, but also to reach above and beyond the expectations.\r\n \r\nThe old Soviet education system proposed that getting quality education means only reading books and attending classes. Being followed by this habit, I was not involved in any extracurricular activities up until the 8th grade. That time I realized that it is not enough to become a competitive student and leader of the local community. \r\n\r\nIn the last 3 years, I have been devoting enough time to study sciences at school, as well as to my English and Russian language clubs and to leading the Issyk-Kul Volunteer Community. Since last summer, I also have been volunteering at a small newspaper called \u201cBalykchy\u201d as an independent journalist. Writing articles about social and economic events, featured stories, and sometimes poems, compose my jobs main responsibilities. \r\n\r\nAfter my participation in the \u201cYouth in the 21st century\u201d media camp, I found new interests: documentary photography and debates. Unfortunately, those are not available in Balykchy and many other small cities in Kyrgyzstan. Among all of my extracurricular activities, public service became the most beneficial to me as well as to the local community. Being a chairman of the community, I have learned to be more organized and independent, and communicate more efficiently with very different people. \r\n\r\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that AUCA gives another opportunity to all its students; a Kiva loan, which helps them cover their tuition fees. Taking this opportunity, I am also applying for the loan, so that I could cover my tuition fees.\u201d

This place is noted for being near a dam and most of its residents work in agriculture and animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nMatilde, 33, lives here.  She\u2019s in a common law relationship and has four children who are 15, 12, 6 and 3 years old.  The  oldest is engaged and two of her children attend secondary and primary school.  Her husband\u2019s a farmer.\r\n\r\nLike a good wife, Matilde will take out the loan for her husband to use in agriculture for he grows cocoa beans and corn all seasons of the year since they have pumps to irrigate their crops.  In winter they also grow rice and peanuts.

Don Librado est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito a VisionFund y KIVA para comprar pl\u00e1sticos y pencas de nopales para su nuevo invernadero. \u00c9l cometo \u201cDesde hace ya mucho tiempo quer\u00eda tener un invernadero pero por falta de dinero era imposible, pero ahora el gobierno nos apoyar\u00e1 y con el cr\u00e9dito de la instituci\u00f3n comprare lo faltante\u201d. Apenas est\u00e1n instalando su invernadero. Don Librado platica las dificultades para obtener dicho invernadero: el gobierno les solicitaban varios tramites en el proyecto se encuentra su esposa Rosa (este grupo es independiente al grupo creado para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito a Kiva y VisionFund). Por varios meses estuvieron solicitando este apoyo finalmente el gobierno les dio una oportunidad de iniciar con su hortalizas. Don Librado ser\u00e1 pieza clave para sacar adelante este invernadero de nopales y verduras, trabajaron en conjuto para poder juntos obtener ganancias satisfactorias. Anteriormente Don Librado tenia una peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes sin embargo decidi\u00f3 cerrar el lugar porque sus ventas ya no eran como deseaba. Ahora ha despositado mucha fe en esta nueva aventura. Sin embargo, la preocupaci\u00f3n mas grande de Don librado es d\u00f3nde vender su producci\u00f3n; ser\u00e1 difil vender su verdura en los puestos o en otros negocios, pero esta consciente de esta situaci\u00f3n por lo que tendr\u00e1  que buscar clientes antes de iniciar a cosechar su verdura.

They live in the same community and they have a great friendship of many years. Librado is a very hardworking man, is 48, and has been in a common-law marriage for nine years. With his partner he has formed a family with two children who haven't started school yet. Librado is asking for a loan from VisionFund and Kiva in order to buy plastic and cactus pads for his new greenhouse.\n\nHe commented, \"For a long time I have wanted to have a greenhouse but without money it was impossible, but now the government will help us and with the loan from the institution I will buy what I need.\" His greenhouse is just now being installed. Librado talks about the difficulties of obtaining the greenhouse: the government required lots of paperwork.  His wife was part of that project (this group is independent of the group created to take out credit with Kiva and VisionFund). For many months they were applying for this help and finally the government gave them an opportunity to start with their vegetables.\n\nLibrado will be a key part of moving this cactus and vegetable greenhouse forward. They worked together to be able to obtain satisfactory earnings. Before, Librado had a small grocery store but decided to close the place because his sales weren't what he desired. Now he has put much faith in this new venture. Without doubt, Librado's biggest worry is where to sell his crops. It will be difficult to sell his vegetables in stalls or in other businesses. He is aware of this situation, therefore, he will have to look for customers before starting to harvest his vegetables.\n\nLibrado's goal is to be able to buy a larger plot of land where he can plant other vegetables to be able to compete with the other large businesses. \"I would really like it if I could become a provider in the large wholesale market. Thereby, I would be able to improve the quality of life of my children.\" The Libra group also includes Vero, who will invest in the sale of shoes by catalog, Gilberta who sells embroidery, Francisca who has a small grocery store and Felix who sells fried foods and snacks. They are very thankful for VisionFund and Kiva for the provided loan because with this, they will be able to invest in their small businesses.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1438872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic and cactus pads.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Pablo Tlachichilpa, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Librado","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"J Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":12109.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991822},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6054.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644469},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6054.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877930}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T01:42:03Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Martin","image":1188596}},{"id":620924,"name":"Karine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karine is 43 years old and she lives in Kapan city.

He is married and has five children, with two of them currently in school. For the past two years, Robert has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells sugar, soap, and salt. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Robert has requested a loan of UGX 3,000,000 from BRAC Uganda.

affordable Barefoot Power solar lighting products to address a critical need for lighting and other basic energy uses in Papua New Guinea (PNG). \r\n\r\nSolar Solutions will accomplish this by setting up a value chain that adds revenue to local small businesses and creates new jobs, bringing clean energy far into rural areas as well as in major cities.  \r\n\r\nCompany Background: Solar Solutions is a start-up company dedicated to improving energy access in PNG. The founders collectively have several decades of experience working in FMCG goods there. In launching a new company, they decided to sell small solar products due to the poor energy situation in Papua New Guinea. \r\n\r\nOnly 10% of PNG has energy access, which means that most people in rural areas rely on dangerous, polluting energy sources to light up their homes at night. Too often we read in the news about children injured by fire from a candle or a kerosene lamp. By reducing indoor air pollution, solar lighting improves health as well as safety. \r\n\r\nEnergy access in cities is also poor. Often there are long hours of the day when the power is out. People in cities need back-up lighting and power to continue basic tasks after sunset. \r\n\r\nOur plan is to set up a reliable distribution network throughout the country by tapping into well-established local businesses in each province who can share the benefits of Solar in their provinces and communities.\r\n\r\nA Kiva loan will enable us to scale up quickly so that we can reach more households with clean energy.\r\n\r\nPartnering with Barefoot will allow us to utilize the expertise that Barefoot Power has gained since its inception and put those learnings into practice. This will help us build a sustainable business supplying a much needed product, in a country that has less than 10% of its population connected to power and who are currently unable to benefit from having an affordable sustainable power source that will assist them in so many ways to develop.\r\n\r\nI have devoted 26 years of my working life to PNG and want to help this country develop so that my children and extended family, as well as the millions of other Papua New Guineans can look forward to a brighter future full of promise.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50000,"image":{"id":1452400,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2893,"youtubeId":"2B89j540CBk","title":"Kiva Borrower Mark Jonathan from Papua New Guinea","thumbnailImageId":1452400},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy and sell Barefoot Power's solar lighting products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PG","country":"Papua New Guinea","town":"Boroko","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6 147","type":"point"}},"partner_id":212,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":50000,"lender_count":1663,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mark Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":50000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25000,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":25000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459021137},{"amount":25000,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490751033}],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T00:24:17Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T09:54:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":624075,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Carlos trabalha como empacotador numa empresa do ramo agr\u00edcola.

Her most recent loan was invested in the business. \r\n\r\nThis is Santa's 12th loan which she will use to finish building her house. Many years ago, Santa started building her house with her business profits, over time she has been able to build her house little by little. Now She wants to invest this loan to buy construction materials such as cement, concrete blocks, rods, and other building materials. She currently has a mostly wood structure home and she will build but her new home will be safer and more secure with bricks and blocks as you can see in the photo. \r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in repaying their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business, and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their businesses and attending their group meetings. Santa thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity. In her name and that of her family, thanks to you for your support!

She lives with her family in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. She has a clothes shop, and has about three years of experience in this field, which makes her an experienced and skilled person with this. \n\nNayar usually sells clothes in the central bazaar. People buy her clothes and are happy with her dealings. Doing clothing sales requires a lot of strength and work in central bazaar, which is very hard for women, and that is why her daughter helps her as well. \n\nShe wants to increase her monthly sales so she needs additional capital to invest in her ready made clothes business. This will allow her to improve the quality of products. For this purpose, she applied for a loan of 50,000 PKR from Kiva's partner, BRAC. She is hopeful that this amount will bring positive change to her monthly

She stitches the garments with the help of needy women living in her locality, in this way she indirectly helps the needy women and earns income for her family. All the ladies are sewing clothes with love and good spirits.\n\nNowadays, two more needy women want to join their company, but there are no more sewing machines available for them. Therefore, Najma requested a loan so that she could buy two more sewing machines to provide a source of income to both ladies to create a means of increasing revenue.\n\nNajma hopes that this loan will prove positive and beneficial for her and for all needy women.

One of the main challenges they have had to face was a plague affecting the crop; but thanks to informative talks and advice from an agriculture entity, they managed to overcome the problem without complications.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a better harvest each season, Herlinda treats the soil with organic fertilizer.  This is her first Kiva loan and she is grateful for the confidence shown in farmers in the area, like herself.  She is requesting 1,000 PEN to buy organic fertilizer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1456774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T09:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T09:40:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":110.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":114.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":124.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":123.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":135.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":134.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":140.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.49,"local_amount":110.63,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":115.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905800},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":116.66,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":121.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091799},{"amount":42.76,"local_amount":114.01,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-31T09:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":118.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778406},{"amount":46.59,"local_amount":124.25,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":129.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598802},{"amount":46.45,"local_amount":123.86,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147699},{"amount":50.94,"local_amount":135.84,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-06T10:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":141.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240792},{"amount":50.47,"local_amount":134.58,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-03T10:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":140.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258231},{"amount":52.56,"local_amount":140.17,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-01T11:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":146.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491502335}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T14:40:53Z","paid_date":"2015-05-01T11:04:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":623523,"name":"Talula Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo lo conforman tres socias de \u00e9xito una de ellas es Soraya tiene la edad de 31 a\u00f1os, casada, con dos hijos menores, su negocio es la venta de sopa de mondongo desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, tiene de ser cliente de la instituci\u00f3n 5 a\u00f1os, el cr\u00e9dito lo est\u00e1 solicitando para la compra de materia prima como le\u00f1a, yuca, repollo, quequisque, mondongo, cebolla, chiltoma, tomate,ayote, chayote, naranja agria etc. Jeysi tiene la edad de 44 a\u00f1os su negocio es la venta de caf\u00e9, pan y leche ambulante y Mar\u00eda tiene la edad de 50 a\u00f1os su negocio es taller de costura y bordado en su domicilio.","en":"The Talula group is comprised of three successful members, one of whom is Soraya.
