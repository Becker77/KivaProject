She has five children, all of whom live with her and her husband in their home made from adobe.  She makes a living in farming and in producing cocoa, barbasco, and other local products.  She has been doing this for more than thirty years with the support of her husband.  When she began this work, she did not have her own land.  Therefore, she began as a worker on other lands and later, with the money she earned together with her husband and with support from her parents, she acquired a plot of land (roughly two hectares).  \r\n\r\nThis land now provides her with a way to make her own money.  She currently has a good variety of cocoa crops that are of a high commercial quality and that are frequently requested in the store centers in her town.  One of her principle objectives is to save up money in order to improve the infrastructure of her home, an activity that will benefit her entire family.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva, and she feels thankful for the financial support that she receives in order to continue moving forward.  She promises to pay her installments on time.  At this time, she is requesting 1,000 soles; she will continue to invest in her lands by buying organic fertilizer and farming tools.

called Llanos del Pinal. She is a 51-year-old married woman with five children who range in age from 13 to 29. The population in her area have small farms where they raise various crops as well as animals. Many of the women are seamstresses.\r\n\r\nRosa is a member of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCielo\u201d meaning \u201cHeaven\u201d. She shares a dream of a better life with 13 other women in the group. The ladies work in textile production, and most of them also grow flowers and other agricultural products as well as raising animals.\r\n\r\nAs Rosa and her family have been farmers for several years, she decided it would be advantageous for her to increase the amount of land she cultivates. She joined the Cielo Trust Bank and secured her first loan. Currently she is in her sixth loan cycle and is eager to receive her latest loan request of $512. She will use the funds to buy seeds and fertilizer for the onions, lettuce, carrots and broccoli that are produced on the farm. These vegetables are then sold to wholesalers in a large market located about one hour away. \r\n\r\nWhen the women involved in Friendship Bridge are asked about the future, they respond by saying they realize that education is the key to a better and more successful future. Rosa realizes how important it is in order for her children to live a more successful life. She knows they will learn to speak Spanish as well as her native dialect. Four of her children are currently in school, with two in high school on the weekends. In this way, the older children can work on the farm during the week.\r\n\r\nRosa and the other women of the Trust Bank Cielo are grateful for the support and trust of Kiva investors throughout the world. With a small loan and education, these hardworking ladies can sustain or grow their businesses, realize an increase in their earnings, empower themselves and eliminate poverty for their families and

With the profits from his farming he wants to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The biodigester will process the manure into methane-rich biogas, allowing him to displace the fossil-fuel based LP gas he currently uses to cook and heat bathwater.\r\n\r\nThis displacement coupled with the destruction of methane released by the animal waste will dramatically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by his farm. Concurrently, the biofertilizer will allow even more nutrients to reach his plants' roots than currently available from unprocessed manure due to the natural decomposition that occurs within the digester.

When asked \"How will this loan benefit his family?\" Peter replied \"Better farm yields.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Peter owns the following:  a cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household mosquito nets and electricity, but does not have solar power, running water, a sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1451204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T15:20:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1437.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1475.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1514.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1554.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1595.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1638.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1681.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1725.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1771.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1818.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1918.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.7,"local_amount":5176.3,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5501.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449658208},{"amount":22.39,"local_amount":1791.02,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1903.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343555},{"amount":20.69,"local_amount":1655.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1759.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467944105},{"amount":20.61,"local_amount":1649.14,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479165107},{"amount":22.11,"local_amount":1768.57,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1879.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859733},{"amount":22.63,"local_amount":1810.64,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1924.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287245},{"amount":23.1,"local_amount":1848.31,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1964.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570598},{"amount":23.39,"local_amount":1871.16,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1988.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530053951},{"amount":30.38,"local_amount":2429.36,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2582.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547168}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T16:38:35Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T14:46:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":623563,"name":"Maria Paz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, se ha decidido nuevamente a trabajar con cr\u00e9dito para comprar ma\u00edz, harina, crema, y otros para la venta de tortillas y quesadilla.

He is married and is the father of 2 children, aged 6 and 2.  His older brother taught him to farm, and when he was young he used to work on different farms in the region, but he decided to become independent and start up his own business.  He has a tannery with which he generates the income he needs to support his household.  However, with the goal of supplementing his income, he wants to go back to agriculture, planting peas on some rented land.  This is why he is requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies at wholesale (seeds, chemical and organic fertilizers, and pesticides).  He will also use the loan to rent a tractor for 20 hours to prepare the land to cultivate the crops.  In this way, he will be able to start up his new project, so that he can generate more income to continue to safeguard the welfare of his family.  Jhon wants to work very hard so that he can accomplish his dream: to have his own land where he could cultivate his crops.  This would reduce his production costs, allowing him to have an opportunity to improve his family's living conditions and

She has a 6th grade education, and she is very grateful for the efforts, support, and sacrifices that her parents made in her youth so that she could complete her elementary education.  She is a housewife who has also been a coffee farmer from a very young age, thanks to her parents.  She has also been raising pigs for 2 years, an activity that she taught herself.  Zoila sees how each day she can generate more income for her family in spite of the difficulties that arise in the area.  Even though the area is not very developed, she sees that there is a need for dressmaking, which is another of the economic activities that she carries out when she is not in the fields.  The land that she cultivates and works is her own; she inherited it from her parents.  The land is located an hour away from her home.\r\n\r\nZoila's dreams and goals for the future are to build a better pigpen and grow her business, because she has a lot of faith in it, in spite of the difficulties she faces in feeding her animals.  She doesn't give her animals anything but concentrate, so that she can get good quality products.  In addition, she continues to work on her coffee crops, because these generate income for her family so that she can provide her children with a better future.  \r\n\r\nZoila is requesting a loan to work toward these dreams.  She will buy 2 pigs and 6 sacks of concentrate (feed), improving the volume of her animals.  She will also make improvements to her pigpen to avoid having bad hygiene for her

She and her spouse have four children but only one of them is still dependent on her since the rest all have homes of their own and are independent people.  She did not complete primary school; she only finished 3rd grade because her parents\u2019 financial situation back then was very limited.

The difference, though, is in the milk and the homemade cheese because the taste is different,\u201d said Mare. \r\n\r\nMare lived in the Alps before coming down to the current district. She is very happy with the progress of her activity. \u201cIt has grown and the demand is growing too,\u201d she said. Mare sells homemade cheese to locals upon prior requests and also sells baby goats. When the babies are born she doesn\u2019t milk the goats for four months because babies can grow very healthy this way, according to Mare.\r\n\r\nMare wants to buy more goats with this

","en":"Bakhtiyot is 36 years old. He is a married man. His wife works in a sewing studio. His two sons go to school, and his daughter is still small for school. Bakhtiyot lives with his family in the city of Khujand. At the moment, he is unemployed.\r\n\r\nFor several years, Bakhtiyot lived in Russia and worked as a minibus driver. He drove Russian citizens from one point in the city to another. Bakhtiyot did not find work in his own city and was compelled to leave his wife and children in order to feed them.

They do not have any children yet but live together in their own house.  Since he was 18, Oscar has worked independently, growing cacao, coffee, and other local, profitable products. Oscar works on his two-hectare plot of land with his wife,.  He learned this trade from his parents as, from a young age, he grew up in the country and learned the necessary techniques for this work.  When Oscar started to earn his own income in this work, he was not able to break even on the money he had invested because of a plague and other problems that affected the crops.  This gave Oscar more motivation and a greater desire to do better.  In order to have a better quality harvest, Oscar usually fertilises his land with organic manure.

She completed only up to second grade at primary school.  Erika works in agriculture, alongside her husband.  They grow coffee together.  They have three children - two of whom are in school, the youngest in kindergarten.   Erika and her husabnd have been growing coffee for over ten years, having learned the trade from their parents.  Erika has always worked growing coffee in order to pay for necessities for her and her family.  Every day she goes to great lengths to keep her harvest healthy and free of plauges, so that she does not suffer any losses.  Erika's land is some 50 metres from her home, and she arrives there on foot.  With a lot of effort and sacrifice, working together as a team, facing challenges such as the low value of coffee in the local and international markets, and dealing with heavy rains, Erika and her husband have been able to prosper in their work - they have no competition in the area.\r\n\r\nErika's plans and dreams for the future, as a farmer and as a mother, are to keep growing crops and to buy more land so that her children can have a better education and can have somewhere to work.  Erika's dream is to see her children have a better quality of life.  She will invest her profits in improving her home.  Erika is applying for a loan from \"COMIXMUL\" in order to buy fertilisers, which are necessary in order to maintain her coffee crops and to have a better yield this season.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1456956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming supplies for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T21:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T21:00:28Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.1,"local_amount":1481.97,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1513.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562417622},{"amount":225.9,"local_amount":4518.03,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-30T10:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4612.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595663842}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T22:05:53Z","paid_date":"2015-01-30T10:23:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":621334,"name":"Ganbaatar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ganbaatar, age 47, became the general manager of a restaurant earlier this year.

She is married to Segundo, who is 38 and works in construction. They have three children, who are ages eighteen, seventeen, and fifteen. Mar\u00eda lives with her family in the canton of Salcedo, located in the western part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces on the ecuatorian mountain range. \r\n\r\nThere are several tourist attractions in Salcedo, such as lagoons and resorts that offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists. However, this town's main business is farming, and to a lesser degree, raising livestock. It is also an ideal place for trade because of the tourist traffic and the residents' needs. In spite of these productive activities, there are very concerning illiteracy and poverty rates due to unmet basic needs, such as sewage services, which are only available in 25% of homes. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda started farming twenty years ago. When she was very young she decided to carve a niche for herself in this business, which she had been familiar with ever since she was a small child, since her whole family were always farmers. Even though the hardest part was getting her business started, she now invests up to ten hours in this business: from before sunrise until the sun sets. Mar\u00eda grows several crops and also raises domestic animals to later sell, like chickens, quail, etc. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan she is now requesting to buy a dairy cow and to adequately prepare a space for the paddock where it will be kept. This will allow Mar\u00eda to give her children better living standards. Additionally, the extra profit that will come of this will allow her to finish building the second story of her house, a project that has been postponed for a long time due to lacking financial resources. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for inviting her to work with them and Kiva, because the trust that people all over the world have put in her and her dreams is very

To start his business, he used the knowledge he had learned as a child helping his parents work in the fields. He has five acres of land where he works daily tending to his crops as necessary in hopes of obtaining high quality products to later sell to local buyers. This way he is able to recover what he invests in buying organic fertilizer. One of his main long-term goals is to rebuild his home using more durable materials and start a very stable family like his parents did. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan through Kiva and he is grateful for the financial support he is receiving in order to get ahead.

She earns a minimum of PhP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Reggie is requesting a loan in the amount of PhP 10,000. She will utilize her loan funds to buy greater quantities of such items as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nReggie dreams of expanding her business and hopes to gain a better living.

","en":"For about seven years, Muhidin has been driving a seven-person van on a bus route. Muhidin's route is called T-67. Muhidin is a 42-year-old married man with four children. His wife works from home sewing women's dresses. Two of the children are in school, and two are still small. \r\n\r\nMuhidin is taking out a loan to repair and renovate his vehicle.

","en":"Salcedo, located in the eastern part of Cotopaxi, is one of the most important provinces in the highlands of Ecuador.  It is an ideal city for commerce because of tourist traffic and the needs of its inhabitants.  Despite the productive businesses of farming and ranching, there are worrying levels of illiteracy and poverty.  Many basic services, like for example sewage systems, are only in 25% of homes, but the local authorities are working to resolve these issues in every home. \r\n\r\nIn this city of enterprising people lives Hilda, a single, 36-year-old woman with two children whom she has cared for alone and who now help her with her work raising guinea pigs for sale.  The guinea pig is an animal that is sold in Ecuador as both a pet and as food in different parts of the country, where it is served with potatoes and peanut sauce.  Hilda has been selling these animals for 10 years and she spends at least four hours a day, seven days a week with them to deliver her customers well-cared-for, strong animals.  This earns her customers' trust and their recommendations to new people who are looking for these animals.  \r\n\r\nHilda needs a loan to improve the animals' nurseries and to buy feed that is more nutritious for them.  With the earnings Hilda generates, she will be able to save up to buy the land she has dreamed of so she can farm more.  She thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for giving her this opportunity through Kiva to get the financing she needs to take the first steps toward achieving her dreams.

His father left him when he was four years old and he was raised by his step-father.  Now he is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in agriculture since he was 12 years old.  His mother and step-father taught him this work.  Besides agriculture, he also works in masonry.  He was taught by a friend that later gave him work as a mixer, but because his friend saw that he was very smart, he gave him the opportunity to do the stonework.

Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and in their personal, household, and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nCelia dreams that her business will grow and expand and hopes that her children will finish their education. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather weekly to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She has four dependent children at various ages.

The association engages in a variety of activities, such as selling clean cookstoves, teaching women to read and write and educating women about family planning.  \n\nIn July, nine women from the association starting selling solar lamps (seven of them are featured in the photo).  As of the end of September they sold 1,200 lamps and they have ambitious plans to grow the sales. \n\nKorotoumou (fourth from the left) is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains.  In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light.  With a solar lamp, her customers can save money.  Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years.  These solar lamps provide 8 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\n\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\n\nSelling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association. The women earn $2 for every lamp they sell and the association earns $3.  The money the association earns is invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\n\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\n\nSince customers cannot afford to pay for the lamps up front, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the solar saleswomen to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit.  When they receive payment from their customers they will re-pay the Kiva loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":29450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":29450,"image":{"id":1455908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to buy solar lamps that they will sell in their communities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mopti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":"2013-10-25T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-24T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":29450,"lender_count":924,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avec-Mali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":14000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":29450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":14000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29450,"local_amount":14000000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":14004300.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517651921}],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T22:03:37Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T16:12:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":624209,"name":"Yolbin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gracias por apoyar a Yolbin, quien con su credikiva compr\u00f3 mucha mercancia, especialmente ropa y calzado, que lleg\u00f3 promovida por su catalogo.

This is 33 -year-old Dorise from Kandehtown Bo, Southern area in Freetown. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 5 years and 12 years.Two of her children are attending school. Dorise runs a cookery business; she sells cooked rice, fried fish and cool drinks. She has been running this business for the past 8 years. She wakes up at 4:30am to prepare her cookery business and she will not rest until the food is finished. One of her daughters usually helps her to run this cookery business. Her business is her only source of income. Dorise finds her major hardship as sometimes preparing the cooked food is very difficult. Dorise has requested a loan in order to purchase cooking items including bags of rice, coconut oil and pure water. The extra income from this loan will allow her to change her cookery structure and pay her childrens school fees. In the future, she plans to have her own residence. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1453541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives in a rural setting with her family and her two nephews who lost their parents. She is the one who caters for their school fees. Mary is a farmer who deals in agriculture, where she grows passion fruits and tomatoes. She works six days in a week and each day, she works for eight hours. She also trades passion fruits as her side source of income. She started her business in 1990. Mary started this business in order to increase her family's income and she has acquired this loan to pay the school fees for her children.
