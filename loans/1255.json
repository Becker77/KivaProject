He is married and has three children. \r\n\r\nHe has been a maize farmer for the past ten years. He would like to use a Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizers during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. \r\n\r\nWith profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

His mother had to raise him all by herself, in poverty, which prompted Juan to quit school in order to work to help her. Juan is married and has two sons. He has been a farmer since he was ten years old, since he learned the trade from his mother and from a neighbour. He also works as a bricklayer, a trade he learned from a man who gave him work so that he would be able to help his mother. At the beginning, it was only simple tasks such as wetting the bricks, but Juan was always observing how the man actually laid the bricks in order to learn to do it himself. Upon noticing this, the man taught him how to do it. Juan is very grateful to this man today, since what he learned from him helps him provide for his family. He is now trying his hand at growing loroco, tomatoes, and passion fruit. He wakes up very early in order to milk the family cow and then commutes to work, which takes him about 45 minutes. His wife takes care of leading the cow to pasture. The loan Juan asks for will be used to buy a heifer, and, with the remaining sum, he will buy 4 sacks of manure, 2 litres of herbicide, 3 litres of fertiliser, and 1 litre of fungicide (this to rid his vegetables from fungi). Juan's dreams for the future are: to buy a car in order to take his produce to market (he has high hopes for his vegetables as well); to see his children graduate from university, a boon he himself was denied; and to build a house of his own, since the one he currently inhabits belongs to a brother-in-law."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1457723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a heifer as well as agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-25T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-24T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Enmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517527032}],"funded_date":"2013-11-22T07:45:25Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":623528,"name":"Gombre Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr SAYOUBA repr\u00e9sente le groupe GOMBRE.

In order to earn her own income, she works in catalog sales of Leonisa brand clothing, as well as Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories for women). She works four days a week but as an hourly worker, because the work is of a type that doesn\u2019t have a fixed schedule. She delivers her products on credit and collects payments weekly.

Rafael is amenable, optimist, and hard-working. He is always able to see the positive side of any situation that life throws at him. He is asking for a loan in order to buy tools he needs for his work (spanners, hammers, pliers, screwdrivers, etc.) and to buy more lubricant to sell. This will enable him to provide a better and quicker service, since he will have all the tools at the ready, thus improving his working conditions.

With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

They have five children between the ages of 7 months and 16 years old. All of her children live at home; only three of them are in school. With a little money from her husband five years ago, she was able to establish her table business where she sells palm oil. She spends 10 hours per day on her business, Monday to Saturday. A problem she faces is a low income. She is requesting a loan to purchase more palm oil for her business. Her plan is to build a house. \r\n\r\nThanks, supporters of BRAC

","en":"Hena is 78 years old and used to work in an office.  When she stopped this work and when she separated from her husband, things became difficult.  In order to earn an income, Hena relied on a friend, who gave her products to sell.  Hena started her business, putting this work as her top priority.  It was not easy to sell cosmetics and other merchandise.  She was not used to this work but she did it, visiting work colleagues, and gradually, she developed a customer base, collecting the money from her sales on credit, and buying products in the city to fulfill her orders.  Hena has workied with four businesses that sell through catalogues for five years.  With the income she makes, Hena has been able to organise her store, buying display cases and stocking up.  Lately Hena has been selling independently from catalogues.  Hena buys products when prices are low, so that she can offer competitive prices to her customers.  Hena mainly sells on credit, collecting the money within two months (on average), depending on the amount the customer buys and how much it cost.  Although Hena lives in a rented property with her son, Hena has stock that she displays in her sister's house, which is nearby.  Hena is very hard-working and also has a monthly income - she earns a percentage from the city raffle, for which she sells tickets.  She also hops to win a house and a car.  Hena's customers usually buy from her, and so Hena considers them as her regulars.  This is Hena's fifth loan with the \"Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\".  With this resource she has been able to increase her profits.  She has new customers and this helps her to improve her quality of life.  Because of this she is grateful for this support and hopes that the foundation can continue to help her.  Today Hena is applying for a Kiva loan in order to buy good quality marchandise that she will bring from the city of Bucaramanga, in the Santander department.  There the quality of leather products, such as footwear, is excellent, and so are the clothes.  Customers are order these clothes for Christmas and New Year, which are now approaching.  Hena's customers all want to look good for family parties and they are all excited to spend loving times with their family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1457785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Caludia was given support by the Colombian government and started her own business, Claudia's determination and dedication quckly allowed her to progress. She now has two stalls in the city market, where she sells for cash and on credit every day.  She buys from distributors who offer her good prices.  Claudia sells to her main customers, street vendors, and to passers-by, who are attracted by the stalls.  Claudia has had two loans from the \"Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\".  With these she has been able to expand her business, and have a greater amount of stock, giving her the chance to offer more choice to her customers.  Claudia's biggest challenge is the competition but, little by little, Claudia's experience has helped her to win over customers from her competitors.  Claudia is applying for a Kiva, which she will use to buy clothes, women's accessories, DIY products, and toys.  Christmas is approaching and so she will be able to sell this kind of stock and make her investment a success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1456959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes, women's accessories, DIY products, and toys.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-10-25T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-24T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Refugee"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83417},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87920},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90557},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":93274},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96072},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98954},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101923},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104981},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108130},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111374},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114715},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118157},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":121701},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125352},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129113},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132986},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136976},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":144398}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-28T09:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2020866.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062513}],"funded_date":"2013-11-24T15:12:10Z","paid_date":"2013-12-28T09:45:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":621744,"name":"Otgontsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Otgontsetseg, 38 years old, lives with her husband and daughter in an old house on a plot of land in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia.

The house they live in has been deteriorating over the years so she is requesting a loan of 7,500,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks,cement, fiberglass and foam for house renovation.

The situation of her separation was very difficult to deal with, since it also meant separation from two of her children. She now lives with her three younger children in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest in the Republic of Ecuador. This canton is located only a few kilometers from the city of Quito, and it has a diversity of forests. Its towns are populated with friendly people characterized by the typical customs of that city. Also found here are diverse microenterprises operated by entrepreneurs who struggle every day to achieve their dreams. Some of the leading activities are agriculture and livestock raising, producing abundant crops which are later sold and distributed to many other provinces. The area also has various tourist attractions such as waterfalls, rivers, paths and swimming areas, where tourists are attracted by the adventure sport services offered there with guaranteed safety. \r\n\r\nIn view of the need to supply the necessities for her children, Lourdes saw the need to start a business on her own initiative, raising chickens. She has invested at least 8 hours a day in this work for the past 8 years. Now she needs a loan to buy chickens and to improve the structure of her pens, so that she can increase the production and sales of her animals. As a result, the profits generated will allow her to improve her economic situation; to grow as a worker and as a person; and one day to see her children become professionals. \r\n\r\nLourdes is grateful to the Alternativa Foundation and to Kiva for opening the doors for this very important step in her life.

With this next loan, he will be able to buy more of each of the beverages that he sells so that he can further grow his inventory.

He says that one of the keys to his success so far has been his practice of selling on credit, which has created great customer loyalty. \r\n\r\nRoll hopes to continue to grow and diversify his store in the future.

Due to her family's difficult financial situation, she was motivated to start her own business to generate the income needed to support the household.  She wants to start selling products through a catalog and through orders, offering her products to all of the contacts in her social network.  She will start the business and see if it provides her with the results she hopes for.  \r\n\r\nWendy's resilient spirit and dynamism are leading her to seek out alternatives to get ahead. To do this, she is requesting the support of a loan so that she can purchase merchandise at wholesale (perfumes, cosmetics, body creams, accessories, and other items), taking advantage of the discounts and promotions that are offered.  This way she can start up her productive enterprise.  Although she is aware that her main challenge is the high level of competition in the market, this does not deter her from continuing forward.  She states that her excellent customer service will be the added value that she offers to her buyers.  \r\n\r\nWendy wants to devote herself to her work, with effort, discipline and dedication, so that she can get her business recognized.  This will give her good profitability so that she will be able to enjoy financial stability and ensure that her business will keep going over time, thereby improving her family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1457835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

With great effort on his own and from his parents he was able to complete ninth grade in the school where he studied, since he had to work every day in the morning with his father in agriculture and then study in the afternoon.  This was his schedule every week day, and on the weekends he worked all day. Later he was not able to sustain his studies, since he had to travel to the city and the economic condition of his parents did not allow it. \r\n\r\nHe is married and father to four children, two of whom study in high school and one in ninth grade.  The other has already moved out and begun his own family.  His wife works selling pupusas in the afternoon in locations where there are gatherings and other events.  His children and his wife all depend on him.\r\n\r\nHe works in agriculture and also raises cattle.  He has been doing this work since the time he was very young and his father taught him because he worked in the same field.  He also taught Gilmer bricklaying.  He has been working in these fields from a very young age since this was his source of income, and he generated it for the family.  He works one kilometer from his home, and he has to get up very early and finish by morning, when he works as a brick layer and works all day.  In the afternoon he helps his wife with sales and his son helps him with agriculture.  The loan will be used to purchase agricultural items: fertilizers and man power for preparing the fields for cultivation.  He hopes to improve his corn crop and at the end of harvest have a larger output and better income for his family.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1457745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase agricultural items: fertilizers and man power for preparing the fields for cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-25T20:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-24T20:40:11Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilmer Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":821.34,"local_amount":821.34,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":821.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622387},{"amount":178.66,"local_amount":178.66,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":178.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088769}],"funded_date":"2013-11-02T01:20:53Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":621887,"name":"Shelden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shelden is from Candanay Norte, Siquijor.

He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future, he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Sin embargo ellos ahora son mayores de edad y le ayudan eventualmente a Fanny en su trabajo pero cada uno lleva una vida y familia independientes. Vive sola en el cant\u00f3n Puerto Quito  de la provincia de Pichincha, uno de los lugares m\u00e1s visitados en el Ecuador por sus caudalosas cascadas y r\u00edos y sus frondosos bosques que en cada uno podemos encontrar a personas con esp\u00edritu emprendedor y aventurero que fomenta el turismo a trav\u00e9s de los deportes extremos y tours por los alrededores. Adem\u00e1s en este cant\u00f3n la actividad econ\u00f3mica m\u00e1s com\u00fan es la agricultura y ganader\u00eda, pues el clima es muy favorable para la siembra de distintas frutas tropicales y verduras que son muy cotizadas en el mercado nacional e internacional. \nFanny se dedica a la crianza y comercializaci\u00f3n de pollos de campo y pollos \u201cpio\u201d, actividad que comenz\u00f3 por iniciativa propia y con una baja inversi\u00f3n y conforme fue creciendo el negocio tanto en demanda y rentabilidad, ella tambi\u00e9n decidi\u00f3 ampliarlo comprando m\u00e1s pollos. Dentro de las tareas m\u00e1s complicadas es cuidar a los pollos beb\u00e9s pues son muy propensos a distintas enfermedades como la Viruela o gripe. \nFanny sue\u00f1a con posicionarse en el mercado agr\u00edcola y tener una empresa distribuidora de pollos, huevos, balanceado, animales de granja y que sea conocida a nivel nacional. Como primer paso para hacer realidad este sue\u00f1o ella requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual pueda comprar m\u00e1s pollos y ampliar y mejorar la estructura de los galpones donde tiene los criaderos. Adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 pensando en comprar un par de cerdos para tambi\u00e9n criarlos y comercializarlos en el mercado local. \nFanny espera que con este pr\u00e9stamo pueda obtener las utilidades para seguir invirtiendo y hacer crecer su negocio poco a poco hasta hacer realidad sue\u00f1o y adem\u00e1s poder tener un estilo de vida de calidad.

","en":"Fanny lives alone in the canton of Puerto Quito, in the province of Pinchincha, one of the most visited places in Ecuador. It has mighty waterfalls and rivers, and dense forests. Enterprising and adventurous people promote tourism through extreme sports and tours in the outdoors. Agriculture and animal-raising are also common ways of earning a living. Tropical fruit and vegetables grow well in the climate there, and the produce is highly valued nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nFanny earns her living raising and selling different kinds of chickens. She started the business on her own initiative and with a small investment she made the business profitable. She decided to expand and bought more chickens. Amongst the most difficult tasks is care of the baby chicks because they are susceptible to diseases such as smallpox and flu.\r\n\r\nFanny\u2019s dream is to position herself as a distributor of chickens, eggs, nutritional food, and farm animals on a national level. As a first step in fulfilling this dream, she needs a loan to buy more chickens as well as expand and improve the sheds where she raises the chicks. She is also thinking about buying a pair of pigs to fatten and then sell in the local market. With the loan Fanny expects to make more money to continue investing in and gradually growing her business until she realizes her dream and improves her standard of living. She is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva for their help in providing the necessary money to  help her with such an important step in her life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1457902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

His business is a small convenience store, selling many different items including cooking oil, sugar, peanuts, etc. With this next loan, he will be able to buy more of each of these items to further grow his inventory. By buying in bulk, he will be able to offer his products at a cheaper price than his competitors, increasing his sales. \r\n\r\nSimon hopes to continue to grow and diversify his store in the future.

She usually raises pigs for seven to eight months before selling them. The selling price is around IDR 3,500,000 per pig, depending on the weight of the pig. The income from the business enables her to support the needs of her family and her children's school fees. \r\n\r\nNonci has four pigs to rise at the moment, and one of them is ready to be sold. She desires to purchase more piglets to raise and also to build more room at her piggery.  Therefore, she has applied for a loan from TLM in amount of IDR 10,000,000. The loan will be spent on piglets and materials to build more room at the piggery.

He lives with his wife and a grown son in the littoral town of Kobuleti. \r\n\r\nIuri is a joiner and manufactures window frames. His wife is a librarian, and their son works as a security guard at the petrol station. They get monthly salaries. \r\n\r\nThe existing funds are too small, so Iuri decided to start up his own business. There is a high unemployment rate in the region, and the majority of the inhabitants are self-employed to make a living. To be able to start up his business, he is requesting a USD 4,200 loan. His loan request was approved, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. \r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions, to rural vulnerable poor people who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the amount he is asking for, Iuri will found a metal and plastics workshop. He has purchased all the needed equipment for manufacturing and needs money to purchase materials for making doors and windows.\r\n\r\nIuri will manufacture and sell them at a good price, because demand is high in the region. He has already got a large quantity order and hopes his business will be lucrative in future. Iuri used to work as a hired worker in this kind of workshop, and he has proper experience in this field. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be a great help for Iuri, to generate revenue and give his family better financial stability.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4200,"image":{"id":1454317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

He is the father of five children, and he has been in the business of farming for the past 18 years. He would like to use a Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizers during maize production.  He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase their production. \r\n\r\nWith profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She has three boys and two girls who are in school. Since 1996, Mwamini has been running a mamalishe business selling food (breakfast, lunch, and supper). She works from 8am to midnight and is able to obtain a good profit every month. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania, which she will use to buy more food supplies for her mamalishe business. With the previous loan, which has been paid back successfully, Mwamini restocked her business with food cooking supplies like rice, maize flour, baking flour, sugar, etc. With the business profit she received, she covered part of her home expenses and school fees. \r\n\r\nMwamini dreams that one day she will be able to own a hotel.\r\n\r\nMwamini will share this loan with her loan group \"DDC\", which totals 11 members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

Kalbubu has specialized secondary education and does animal husbandry and field crop cultivation as a main source of income for her family which she started 38 years ago with a purchase of livestock for 1,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Kalbubu now has one horse, 30 sheep, two milk cows, two calves and also 3.4 hectares of land where she annually grows beans, potatoes and perennial grasses.

Zurabubu has higher education and works as a doctor in the regional hospital. She does animal husbandry as an additional source of income for her family which she started 23 years ago with a purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Zurabubu now has one milk cow, two horses and also 1.26 hectares of land where she annually grows potatoes and wheat. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. With the purpose to further grow her business Zurabubu has come to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som to buy a cow to increase her livestock headcount. Zurabubu plans to invest the income from the loan into further increase of the headcount of livestock and save money for her children's further education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1456414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Mar\u00eda lives with one of her sons, 33-year-old Jorge, who works as a builder, and her daughter-in-law.  They live in the Pedro Vicente Maldonado canton in the Pichincha province, Ecuador.  The Pedro Vicente Maldonado canton has many places to visit, like rivers and forests, which many tourists go to see.  When tourists come during festivals, they can see artisan exhibitions and fayres, where farming products and cattle, which are important for many inhabitants' livelihoods, are displayed.  These events have provided private businesses with the opportunity to build hotels, hostels, and offer various services for tourists.  However the main business in this town is agriculture and cattle raising.  Every year this work increases the town's economic output, even though there is little technology in the area.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda makes a living doing various types of work, within the farming sector - she milks cows, harvests cocoa, and raises chickens.  Even though Mar\u00eda had a porblem with her leg a few years ago, stopping her from working, she has continued to raise and fatten up chickens.  She learned this trade from a very young age, from her parents who worked in this same area.  Mar\u00eda invests some ten hours of her day in looking after the animals.  Particularly when they are babies, the chickens need a lot of care, as they are sensitive to illnesses.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda dreams of having a farm raising chickens and pigs.  To start on the path towards this dream, she will buy more chickens, and increase the size of her sheds.  In order to do this, Mar\u00eda needs a loan.  She will increase her income to pay basic costs, and will also save up to look after her health in her old age.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1457914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy chickens and extend the sheds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pedro Vicente Maldonado","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-10-26T12:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-25T12:00:04Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1142.73,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":87.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":91.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":97.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":103.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":105.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":107.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.09,"local_amount":75.61,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":76.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059949},{"amount":88.06,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995280},{"amount":88.52,"local_amount":87.96,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":88.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413724},{"amount":91.73,"local_amount":91.15,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":91.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102364},{"amount":94.76,"local_amount":94.16,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":94.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212254},{"amount":710.84,"local_amount":706.35,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":710.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138254}],"funded_date":"2013-10-26T14:52:18Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":624855,"name":"Danaya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe    DANAYA est constitu\u00e9 de 4 femmes toutes mari\u00e9es ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 45 ans et 3 enfants.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

","en":"Rosario lives in the San Miguel de los Bancos Canton, Pichincha Provence of Ecuador. She is very fortunate to live in one of the most touristic places of the Canton, known as the Mindo Parrish, which is visited by many foreigners who come to enjoy the beautiful scenery, ranches, waterfalls, and other places.\r\n\r\nShe is a single mother who lives in a humble home with her 3 children; the oldest is 11 and the youngest is 5. They go to school in the area. Rosario comes from a family with few economic resources. Her parents only sent her to primary school due to the financial situation, which is still a challenge. She also had a problem with one of her lungs and couldn't work for 15 days.\r\n\r\nBecause she is the head of household, she doesn't have a lot of free time. Apart from her chicken production business, she also works in the kitchen of a restaurant nearby. She works an average of 10 hours a day. However, whenever she can, she takes advantage of her free time to be with her children.\r\n\r\nShe started her chicken business on her own because the area has several restaurants and it is a popular place. She started with 10 chickens and sold them. This made her realize that it was a profitable business and that there weren't many expenses because she could deliver them throughout her own Parrish.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of the business is taking care of the baby chicks. She has to watch them carefully and make sure that they don't get sick. If they do get sick, she has to care for them and give them special treatment for a fast recovery.\r\n\r\nRosario has many dreams, including improving and expanding her small home and growing her business. She would also like to buy a car in the future to use for her business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Rosario is taking initiative on one of her dreams by growing her business. She will buy chickens and expand their coop. She is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the opportunity they are providing her to succeed and improve her quality of

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She purchases clothing and dressmaking materials from the city market and resells it at her village. The income from the retail business helps the family to cover its daily costs and it is very important for them. Thus, Julieta has applied for this loan to be able to purchase new stock of clothing and sell it to her customers. \r\n\r\nShe has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

The Startup Program gives vulnerable poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of $2000, he will purchase second-hand shoes at wholesale prices and sell them from a stall located at the local fair market. He will offer his customers a wide assortment of well-priced products. Part of the loan will be used for purchasing a van, for product transportation.

Last year, one of his grown-up calves died from the cold, and it was very upsetting to him because he could not prevent it from happening.
