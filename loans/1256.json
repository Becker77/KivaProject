Arkadi and his big family will be grateful to all the lenders for helping them collect the needed loan to sustain their agribusiness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1454511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase three steers, two pigs, and  some forage for the livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Dalarik village of Armavir region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-10-26T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-25T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arkadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":115.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":115.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":116.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":119.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":117.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":120.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":120.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":121.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":122.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":126.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":128.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":128.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":132.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":134.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":136.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":137.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.41},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":622125,"name":"Lawrence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lawrence is a male Ugandan, aged 35 years and married to Agatha.

This is 44-year-old Fadzayi from Mutare. She is married with three children, two of whom are attending school. She also cares for two other dependents. Fadzayi runs a poultry business producing chickens. The business has been in operation for 10 years. She says the main challenges faced are poor quality feed from suppliers and high competition.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She makes her purchases in different cities around the country and makes her sales on foot and from her home, where she has steady and occasional customers, and sells to them for cash and credit.  She collects every one to two weeks.  She used to have a small food store, but she realized that she could also sell general merchandise, since it generated more income than the food store.  The goal for this loan is to have working capital so she can buy general items such as different styles of clothing, cosmetics, chinoiserie, and other things, so she can take advantage of the current season, when her sales increase.  Marta de la Cruz is grateful to the Kiva lenders who help people of limited resources in poor countries like Nicaragua to have a source of dignified work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1457912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-10-26T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-25T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta De La Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.7,"local_amount":1000.87,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545931},{"amount":42.63,"local_amount":1023.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1066.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199679},{"amount":40.98,"local_amount":983.6,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449669054},{"amount":39.33,"local_amount":943.97,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":984.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459139692},{"amount":129.86,"local_amount":3116.72,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3249.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176224},{"amount":28.72,"local_amount":689.21,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":718.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298153},{"amount":69.59,"local_amount":1670.14,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1741.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530064346},{"amount":107.19,"local_amount":2572.39,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-26T10:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579618900}],"funded_date":"2013-11-25T18:24:00Z","paid_date":"2014-12-26T10:26:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

The members of this bank have different businesses, such as pastries, jewelry sales, furniture, food and empanada sales.  Veronica makes throw pillows and also crochets different things.  She has had this business for more than 30 years and she earned this from her grandmother.  She started out doing it for one home, but her friends taught her to take orders for items to sell.  This is how she began selling.  She had problems with her old machine, which her grandmother had given her.  It was made in 1890.  It stopped working, so she needs the money to be able to buy a new machine.  At the moment she can only knit and crochet and can sometimes borrow a machine to put the finishing touches on the pillows.  Besides buying a sewing machine, she also wants to buy supplies.

Erlinda anteriormente tuvo un compromiso del cual procre\u00f3 un hijo que ahora tiene 8 a\u00f1os, el mismo que fracas\u00f3 en vista de que no contaba con el apoyo econ\u00f3mico de su c\u00f3nyuge y tambi\u00e9n porque no la dejaba emprender en ning\u00fan negocio para poder sacar adelante a su familia. Hace 5 a\u00f1os conoci\u00f3 a Julio un se\u00f1or muy responsable con quien vive actualmente y tienen una hija de 4 a\u00f1os. Ellos viven en una casa arrendada.

It\u2019s also known for having a very important ethic group in the Tsachila community, representative of Ecuador.  Erlinda was previously engaged and had a son who is now 8 years old.  The engagement failed because her partner did not support her financially and also because he would not allow her to start any businesses to help get the family ahead.  She met Julio five years ago and he is a very responsible man with whom she now lives and they have a four year old daughter together.\r\n\r\nThey live in a rented home.  Her oldest son attends a school that is a bit far away and he travels by bus every day.  Her daughter stays home with her.  Her husband is a hardworking and responsible gentleman who has been doing farm work for hire for the past eight years, but his income is not enough to cover the household expenses.  For this reason, Erlinda decided to start a clothing sales and cosmetic business three years ago.  She works it 3-4 hours a day, visiting her customers door to door, and spends the rest of the day caring for her family.\r\n\r\nNow both work to sustain the household and work every day to get ahead and achieve one of their dreams of having a shop so that they can have a better income and be able to buy a house.  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has provided them with the opportunity to increase their income, by providing a small loan to buy merchandise.  She tells us that this is a good season to invest in merchandise because of the approaching Christmas season.  She is very grateful to the institution because they have opened the door for her to improve financially, while other institutions did not want to support her with this amount of money.  She is certain that her quality of life will improve. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1457954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-10-26T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-25T20:30:10Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda  Graciel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":676.17,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":93.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":99.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":102.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.77,"local_amount":89.61,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":92.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059951},{"amount":96.16,"local_amount":92.89,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":96.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995282},{"amount":97.11,"local_amount":93.8,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":97.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413726},{"amount":101.47,"local_amount":98.02,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":101.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102366},{"amount":102.95,"local_amount":99.45,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":102.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212256},{"amount":104.45,"local_amount":100.89,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":104.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138256},{"amount":105.09,"local_amount":101.51,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":105.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832266}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T23:50:09Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

He has a coffee store in a nearby trading center and also operates a coffee farm where he harvests his own stock to sell. He is married with one child and also looks after his elderly parents because they are too old to take care of themselves.

In addition, he also cares for his own hortense flower crop that he\u2019s had for about two years and that produces extra income for him to support his family and one-year-old son.\r\n\r\nHis drive, perseverance and wish to succeed impel him to seek alternatives that will support his growth process and this is why he\u2019s asking for the loan that he\u2019ll use to pay off a debt he has with suppliers and to pay off another pending loan.  This will make it possible for him to have cash on hand to face his main challenge which is managing his client portfolio because they pay him every three months but his micro-business has expenses that don\u2019t wait, they arrive monthly affecting his business\u2019 bottom line.\r\n\r\nCarlos wants to continue striving to move his work forward once more and be able to access the possibility of expanding his crops, acquiring more customers and offering employment opportunities.  In this way, he\u2019ll be more profitable and generate higher income to ensure his family\u2019s improved well-being and quality of

He currently has 4 children attending school in different grades, including high school, 9th grade, 7th grade, and 5th grade.  His other children are already grown, but they continue to live in his house.  One of them works as a farmer and has other economic activities.  Alfredo's wife devotes herself to the household chores.  They are a very united family, because each of them contributes to put food on the table and cover other family expenses.  \r\n\r\nAlfredo is a mason by profession; he has about 20 years of experience in this activity, and this is how he provides for his family.  One of the things that motivated him in this work was that as a child his dad, who was a mason, would take him to work, and so he learned the trade rapidly and on the job. He was seeing that this was an activity where one could earn money, and so decided to learn this trade very well so that now he is one of the best in the area where he lives.  In addition, he has also always worked in agriculture, because this has been another source of income for him.  For a long time he had 20 cows, from which he obtained income for his family, but because of some problems he had to get rid of them.  Alfredo has involved his children in his masonry work; they are learning how to do the same work that he does.\r\n\r\nAlfredo will use this loan to buy dairy cows, specifically, he will buy one dairy cow to start producing as he did before.  With this, he will be able to obtain another source of income for his family, and thereby improve his children's living conditions as they get an education.

old. Together with her husband she raises a daughter. Anara works as a lawyer, and her husband works with vulcanization. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, the couple started a business of selling car tires made more durable through vulcanization with rented equipment. They used an amount of 150,000 som (KGS) as a start-up capital. After having managed to develop the business and to find returning customers, Anara had an average income of 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to persistent work with the business, the couple managed to purchase the vulcanizing equipment they had previously rented. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further improve and develop her business, Anara turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase tires wholesale to subsequently sell. Anara plans to invest the income from the loan in increasing the working capital and save money for buying a

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. \r\n\r\nEmma dreams of expanding her business and hopes to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1455378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for recyclable materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-10-27T17:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-26T17:00:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6822.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824979},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":6666.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6822.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478801},{"amount":126.66,"local_amount":5333.62,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5458.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701203},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":1333.38,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T09:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1364.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450029463}],"funded_date":"2013-10-27T17:42:15Z","paid_date":"2014-02-19T09:50:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":624258,"name":"Maria Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Joven Mar\u00eda del Rosario tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en un barrio de Tegucigalpa, en el centro de Honduras, tiene 2 hijos y vive con su esposo,  se dedica desde hace 3 a\u00f1os a la venta de tortillas, se levanta muy temprano todos los d\u00edas para elaborarlas y luego sale a entregarlas a sus clientes. \nMar\u00eda del Rosario es una mujer muy trabajadora y emprendedora el pr\u00e9stamo lo necesita para la compra de un comal, harina y le\u00f1a materiales que necesita para la elaboraci\u00f3n de su producto y de esta forma poder seguir con sus ventas y cubrir los pedidos de sus clientes.\nMar\u00eda del Rosario espera que la inversi\u00f3n que realice a su negocio le genere las utilidades suficientes para poder salir adelante con su familia  y a la vez espera que su negocio siga creciendo.\nMar\u00eda del Rosario su sue\u00f1o es siempre poder darle a sus hijos una buena educaci\u00f3n y que estos tengan mejores oportunidades.\n\n\nTegucigalpa, Honduras \u2013 Octubre del 2013\n","en":"Mar\u00eda del Rosario is 24 years old and lives in a neighborhood in Tegucigalpa, in the central part of Honduras.

Mar\u00eda is a housewife who sells shoes and Yanbal brand products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume and ladies' accessories) by mail order to generate her own income with which she can help her husband with the household expenses.  She sells her goods by going from door to door during her free time, leaving the goods on credit and collecting payments every eight days.  She set up her business with some credit that she got from the bank and is very grateful to the institution.  She will use the loan to buy perfume, creams, cosmetics and shoes.  She has been a member of the communal bank for 12 years and is pleased with it because she set up her business with one of the loans.  Her dream is to own a boutique."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1458908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfume, creams, cosmetics and shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-10-27T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-26T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":792.76,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":99.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.01,"local_amount":99.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419858092},{"amount":200.01,"local_amount":198.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":200.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506466},{"amount":300.01,"local_amount":297.3,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":300.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730223},{"amount":199.97,"local_amount":198.16,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":199.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636304}],"funded_date":"2013-10-27T19:24:21Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T11:24:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":622627,"name":"Bella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Bella.

His wife is a very hardworking and responsible woman and fulfills her household duties efficiently. \r\n\r\nSince 1992, Ashiq has been in the business of selling milk, which is the only source of income for the family. He has two buffaloes for this work. He sells their milk door to door and in the main market. By doing so, he generates income for fulfilling his family's needs. His current net income is not enough to cope with the daily and monthly needs of his family. He has lots and lots of expenses to pay for, such as electricity bills, gas and water bills, the children\u2019s school fees, food expenses and also the buffaloes\u2019 upkeep and their food expenses. So, he is planning to purchase one more buffalo to increase his selling.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he is interested in purchasing one more buffalo to grow his business, but he finds it difficult due to financial constraints. Ashiq has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. He will use the loan amount to purchase a buffalo. This will not only help him to increase his milk selling, but will increase his net income and savings as well. He hopes to provide quality education for his children. He is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan. \r\n\r\nNote: In the picture, Ashiq is standing with one of his buffaloes at the farm where he keeps the

Two of her children are still in school. She has five other persons to support. Valerie has been a merchant for twenty years and sells fresh staple foods retail (cassava, plantains) at a local market according to the season. She is very familiar with suppliers and especially her customers, whom she has acquired over the course of time, thanks to her experience in this domain.  \r\n\r\nBut she constantly finds herself short of inventory, since she is compelled to sell her entire inventory before being able to acquire more. This is due to her meager capital. She would like to purchase a truck-load of plantains to have a good stock enabling her to do better in satisfying the constant demand from her customers and to avoid inventory shortages. She will save her profits not only to expand her business but also to meet the needs of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1459218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase plantains to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2013-10-27T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-26T20:10:06Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.06,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valerie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10354},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10744},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11134},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11525},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11915},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12305},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12695},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13085},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13475},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13866},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14256},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14646}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.89},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.43,"local_amount":10353,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10666.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439626064},{"amount":23.28,"local_amount":10745,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T09:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":11070.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449533647},{"amount":21.03,"local_amount":9707,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T08:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10001.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":458998602},{"amount":3.09,"local_amount":1426,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T08:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1469.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468138662},{"amount":24.97,"local_amount":11524,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T08:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":11873.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479031497},{"amount":46.13,"local_amount":21292,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-20T08:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":21937.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":505311673},{"amount":33.85,"local_amount":15623,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-31T09:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":16096.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542416067},{"amount":118.35,"local_amount":54684,"processed_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-03T10:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":56341.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.14,"payment_id":561553930},{"amount":29.81,"local_amount":14646,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-31T10:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":15089.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":595070051}],"funded_date":"2013-10-27T22:41:20Z","paid_date":"2015-01-31T10:11:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":622684,"name":"Bunju B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Prosista, who is in her late 20s, is single with a boy who is still young.

","en":"Saydamir is 61 years old. He resides in Kulob and drives a white minibus. Everybody calls this minibus \"Tango,\" and it has room for seven passengers. Saydamir has driven \"Tango\" for more than seven years. Such minibuses are not durable, first because it is a passenger vehicle, and second they quickly wear down. Saydamir is asking for credit to repair his minibus. He does not have enough money for a new vehicle, but repairs of his vehicle are cheaper. Saydamir is planning to repair his vehicle and return to work. Then he hopes to raise funds and buy a new car.
