She was able to attend grade school through the fourth grade. She lives with her life partner who works in agricultural activities and as a laborer on a pig farm that is in her village. They have three children who live with them and currently only the oldest of the three is in school.\r\n\r\nShe has a small store in her home where she sells sweets, basic grains, soft drinks, and more items. She has been working in this activity for four years. She learned this activity without anyone teaching her, saying that \u201cshe has learned it along the way.\u201d Previously she worked doing domestic work, but the necessity of having some sort of household earnings made her make the decision to begin her business. Besides selling from her house, on the weekends she sells enchiladas, toasted bananas, water, and soft drinks at the canton\u2019s soccer field, taking the opportunity as people come to see the games taking place those days. At home she tends to the business from Monday through Friday and some weekend hours. A sister and a brother help with the business.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan in order to supply the business. She needs to buy more products. She said that the little investment she already has is not enough to cover the great demand there is in the canton.\r\n\r\nHaving the loan, she will be able to take the opportunity through growing and diversifying the range of products that she can offer her customers, generating more income for her and her family.\r\n\r\nShe wants her business to become more productive in time, for her family to be able to maintain themselves from what the activity brings in and for her children to study and graduate from university.

He makes headdresses and garlands for grooms.  He started this business over five years ago. The headdresses are to be used for grooms and so are worn only for a single day, but the cost is high due to the expensive decoration on the headdresses. There is a lot of demand for headdresses and garlands because the marriage season is on peak at this time. He has many regular customers and also takes orders from other cities.  \r\n\r\nThis seasonal business yields a good income for Ghulam Rasool. He wants to get extra profit during the marriage season and wants to offer more headdresses of various attractive designs.

Jose is married and has three children, of whom one works and the others are in school. His wife takes care of the household.\r\n\r\nJose has been a farmer all his life, despite the fact that his mother never tried to put him in school. His father left when he was two years old. If he worked hard to have an honest career, he would be able to make a living. This is why Jose started a career in farming along with his mother and older sister. With them, he completed tasks of planting seeds, controlling weeds and infestations, and most importantly, completing the production process of harvesting. Since then, he hasn't stopped working in the field and has continued working to earn income for his family.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy materials to improve his home, which is in bad condition due to deterioration from storms in the past winter. For this reason, Jose needs to buy laminate to improve the roof of his home so it no longer leaks.\r\n\r\nJose's dream is to improve his family's quality of life. This is why he has to keep working and fighting as he has been doing. However, he recognizes that there are more than just economic factors, which are why he says that the best inheritance that he can give his children is an education.

They get monthly salaries. Resan runs a small-scale agricultural business. In particular, he owns a citrus garden, and four beehives with bee colonies.  Resan and his family members work hard all day long to earn their living, but their existing income is not enough to cover food and the everyday expenses of such a large family. That is why Resan decided to start his own business.\r\n\r\nAll of the financial institutions rejected his loan requests, because of his unstable financial condition and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Resan applied for credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a Start-Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva. This program enables the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $5000 will help him to purchase a minibus. He will work on the minibus line, transporting passengers from his village to Batumi city. The new business initiative will significantly increase the family funds. With the increased income, he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family

Unfortunately, Diana was unable to obtain a loan from existing financial institutions, as they required business experience and stable income as a precondition to a loan.

This start-up loan program provides start-up and re-startup loans with easy terms to the vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit products. With a loan of 2,000 USD Diana will purchase stock of basic groceries to start a store. She will work as a salesperson herself and serve her clients in a friendly way. \r\n\r\nDiana is very determined young lady who wishes to help her family members.

In spite of her age, she remains hale and hearty, and always seeks to try out new things.  She hopes to start her own business dealing in children's clothing; to this end, she has taken a course organized by an association for businesswomen titled \"Attain Success\".  Mahbuba wants nothing more than to get her business up and running, but she lacks the money to do so.  As such, she is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to stock up on children's clothes.  She needs your help, and is counting on your kindness.

He lives with his wife, daughter, son, and elderly mother. To be able to take care of his family Vahan is engaged in breeding livestock such as cows, piglets, and hens and cultivates tomatos, greens and alfalfa. Vahan's family members help him greatly in his activities related to farming; Vahan's son helps him sell the agricultural products in the local market. In order to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Vahan needs a loan of USD 2,500 to purchase wheat seeds, fertilizer, forage for his livestock, harvesting services and to make previous credit repayments. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to repay it back. However, thanks to his hard work recently, Vahan was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments.

Now we are happy to report that the group finished paying back the loan a few days ago. The women are grateful and satisfied with the progress, because their small businesses have either grown a little or have maintained the same level. Currently the 8 women of this trust bank are starting another loan cycle and they are asking again for funds through KIVA. \r\n\r\nJust as a reminder, these ladies are from a rural area in Guatemala full of agriculture fields, including the sweet crop of strawberries. In their last loan cycle we told the story of Rosa, who is doing great and is still part of the group. Now we want to share the story of Marta who is 34 years old and currently playing the role of secretary of the trust bank. \r\n\r\nMarta is married and has 2 children aged 8 and 5 years old. She and her family are farmers and they are dedicated to the cultivation of strawberries, starting about 7 years ago. However, they could not grow as much as they wanted, because they needed financial capital. That is when Marta decided to join Friendship Bridge with the intention of finding working capital. She was accepted into the Microcredit Plus program from Friendship Bridge, which includes a loan and training. Now Marta is starting her third loan cycle. The amount requested will help her to buy foliar fertilizer and organic fertilizer for her crops, so they can continue with production. Marta's family cultivates 4 acres of land and has potential clients to whom they deliver between 25 and 35 boxes of strawberries. This allows the working capital to move more easily affording the family a consistent income. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the cultivation of strawberries, Marta also plants corn, beans, and squash. These products are used for both the family's own consumption and for sale. This means that Marta has the ability to repay the loan each month. \r\n\r\nBoth Marta and the other women of the group, receive training on business administration, money management, women's health, children's rights, and health, among other issues that are part of the benefit of Friendship Bridge's micro-credit and education program that serves to increase the knowledge of these women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5925,"image":{"id":1455802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

In the afternoon, she cleans houses. She is motivated to work hard because she wants her children to be successful in the future. She realizes that the key to success is education. Four of her children are in elementary school and the fifth one is in kindergarten. Currently, Maria Beatriz is starting her third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. Her loan of $385 will help to launch her newest business endeavor which will be a \u201ctortilleria\u201d where she will make and sell tortillas. She plans to buy corn in bulk. Maria Beatriz looks forward to increased profits so that she will be able to purchase better food which in turn will lead to better health for her family.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank, \u201cCarino\u201d, appreciates the support and confidence of Kiva investors throughout the world. Because of these small loans, these women have a way to generate income, working with their husbands to support their families. For  women who are single, divorced or widowed, the loans are essential. It is a true win-win situation which improves the lives of families and the well-being of their community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6250,"image":{"id":1455855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Four of them are currently in school. Rosa and her family live in rural Llanos del Pinal, Quetzaltenango in the western highlands of Guatemala, where many people are engaged in activities like agriculture and animal husbandry. Many women are also seamstresses. Rosa belongs to the community bank called CIELO (Heaven), along with 13 other women, who seek to develop themselves and their families. Besides agriculture, these ladies are also dedicated to sewing, growing and selling flowers, buying and selling all kinds of vegetables, breeding animals, etc.\r\n\r\nRosa and her family have been engaged in the farming industry for several years.  She decided to approach Friendship Bridge for a loan to increase the amount of land available for cultivation. Currently, she is starting her 6th loan cycle; Rosa is so excited to request a loan of 512 USD, which she\u2019ll use to buy seeds, fertilizer, and manure for a crop of 10 strings. Among the products they grow there are: onions, lettuce, carrots, and broccoli. Rosa and her family sell the vegetables to wholesalers in a large market located about 1 hour from their land. \r\n\r\nRosa's great desire is that her children could stay in school, so their future can be better than hers. She says that it's hard not knowing how to write in Spanish, even though she understands and speaks some Spanish. Currently two of her children are in high school on weekends so they can support the family during the week in the field. Also her two youngest children are in elementary school daily.\r\n\r\nRosa and the other women of the trust bank CIELO are grateful for the support and trust of KIVA investors. With the working capital they give, these ladies can make their small businesses grow and\/or maintain the same level. Their businesses are sources of income for them and their families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3975,"image":{"id":1455809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Yanna said her most difficult challenges have been to complete her university studies and raise and educate her children. \r\n\r\nThis is Yanna's tenth loan with Esperanza. She started her business with the first loan she received from Esperanza International almost six years ago. She plans to use this loan to purchase different pairs of shoes, sandals and tennis shoes for men, women and kids.

Most bateys are located in a sugarcane field and were built for the sugarcane industry workers.\r\n\r\nConsuelo says her most favorites things to do are to take her children to eat ice cream and to the park. Her most important challenge is to continue growing in her life and business. Three years ago Consuelo started her clothing sales business with the money she received when she stopped working in a company.\r\n\r\nConsuelo is receiving her fifth loan from Esperanza International and will invest this capital into her clothing sales business; this loan will be invested to buy new clothes and pants by the dozen. With her business profits, she will reinvest in her business. She dreams of having a nail and beauty salon in a better location.\r\n\r\nConsuelo and her group are going to devote themselves to various areas of work such as clothes, cosmetics, shoes, beauty salons, grocery stores, etc. Thanks for supporting this group of entrepreneurs!

Among the services he offers are transportation for the wedding cortege, setting up halls, organizing buffets and decorating churches where the wedding ceremony is held. Since Andrei\u2019s business has no competition in Drogobych, he has many orders and the demand is relentless. Although Andrei is very busy and works very hard, he cannot save up enough money to keep his house warm, which he and his family have long needed.\r\n\r\nTo do the repairs, Andrei needs 20,000 hriven to insulate the house, where the temperature gets unbearably low during the winter. Because the walls are thin and don\u2019t hold the heat well, it\u2019s difficult to heat the house, and his little 3 year-old daughter often gets really cold. With a loan from Kiva, Andrei hopes to install plastic foam, which is reasonably effective and the most obtainable insulating material. Andre loves his family very much and is always trying to keep them comfortable and ensure a decent life for his loved

With this loan, Mariela plans on purchasing textbooks and other school-related items. With these supplies Mariela hopes to be able to better understand her subjects. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Mariela's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, her parents never had the chance to move up. With one older sibling attending college already, Mariela is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her own without the assistance of a loan from Banco Fie. Mariela's father works as a farmer and his salary is the family's primary source of income.\r\n\r\nTo support her family and studies, Mariela currently works 30 hours a week in a bakery and has been doing so since the age of 16. One of her biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school.

She operates her shop in a space on one side of her house.  Her sister helps her on weekends because she now has more customers than she can take care of by herself.  Oralia also sells beauty products.  She buys the products from a catalog and sells them to her customers.  Her income, along with her husband's, supports the family's needs and ensures that they can provide for their 10-year old son.  The borrower is a hard-working and enterprising woman, characteristics that have allowed her to meet her goals up to now.  She is now applying for a loan that she will use to buy the equipment she needs--hair dryer, brushes, scissors and other equipment--to carry on her business.  She will also buy wholesale supplies of beauty products--perfume, cosmetics and others--that she will resell.  The investment will improve Oralia's business and allow her to deliver a better service to her customers.  The wider range of products will provide her with a larger profit margin and, in turn, increase the income she has to support her family.  Oralia wants to expand her salon and provide new services, something that will ultimately lead to a better quality of life for her and her

In addition, she is financially responsible for 4 other people.  Rose has sold sticks of cassava at a street market for 10 years.  She has a good knowledge of her suppliers and her customers.  This knowledge has been built up over time due to her experience in this field.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, she often runs out of stock because she must sell everything before she has enough money to buy further supplies due to the small size of her capital.  She would like to buy a portion of a cassava field to improve her stock levels, respond better to the demands of her customers and prevent her out-of-stock problems.  She will use her earnings to increase the size of her business and provide for the needs of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1460639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a portion of a cassava field.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.13,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose De Viterbe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3449},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3580},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3710},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3841},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3971},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4101},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4232},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4362},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4493},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4623},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4754},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4884}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.57,"local_amount":7029,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T09:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8348.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449533649},{"amount":60.55,"local_amount":24217,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-04T09:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":28763.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520465953},{"amount":22.79,"local_amount":9116,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-31T09:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10827.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542416069},{"amount":11.86,"local_amount":4754,"processed_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-03T10:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5646.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.02,"payment_id":561553932},{"amount":12.1,"local_amount":4884,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5800.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":579459136}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T15:50:16Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:13:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Ryder","image":1886035}},{"id":623110,"name":"Leonora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonora, 29 years old, is married with two children.

She is a senior entrepreneur, experienced, energetic, 52 years old, and a mother of seven children, of whom two are students, while the others already have their own homes, respectively. Her husband is a public servant. This client sells food supplies. Her house is her main location. She started her business with her own funds from her husband. Later on, she benefited from additional funds from the microfinance institution Hekima. She has been in this business for ten years. \r\n\r\nThis new loan is going to be used to purchase food supplies: 2 sacks of cassava, a basket of taro, 3 bunches of bananas, a sack of corn, etc. Thus, she would like to provide education for her two children and to purchase a plot of land on which to build a house to rent out. Her main challenges for developing her business include selling on credit and the growing insecurity in rural supply areas occupied by rebels and other undesirable armed groups.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, she thanks Hekima very much for promoting autonomy among unbanked women entrepreneurs, especially at this critical time of war in the country's east.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6175,"image":{"id":1460648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase food supplies (cassava, taro, bananas, corn, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

His father was a cattle breeder and Tulkindjon helped him since he was a child, and had his own ram that he had to take care of. As Tulkindjon himself says, \"At that time taking care of a ram was a childhood passion. Now, raising livestock is my means of making a living.\" He grew up and followed his father's footsteps. It wasn't easy at first, especially in the wintertime, when the earth was completely covered in snow and he had to put more resources toward feeding the animals. But through the years, experience proved itself and Tulkindjon started to find ways of solving problems for the best continuation of his business. Now he has four sheep and two cows, and his wife also helps him. Tulkindjon is also a craftsman - a bricklayer and plasterer. He makes extra money to cover housing, his children's education costs and everyday expenses. For seasonal reasons he can't sell his sheep right now and buy feed, since prices for them have fallen. Tulkindjon needs additional resources so that he can feed his animals and bring in new livestock. With this goal in mind he has turned to microfinance organization \"Arvand\" for a loan. He believes that the acquired loan will help to eliminate his difficulties. He conveys his thanks to Kiva for the assistance and its huge importance in his life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1455203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock feed and cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u0422\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0447\u043e\u043d ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1611.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1722.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":361.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5009.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081150}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T17:11:38Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":623126,"name":"Criselda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Criselda is thankful for the previous financial assistance extended to her.

He is married and has three children. Despite his young age, Suhbat has a lot of experience in business activities. From an early age, he was trying to engage in different types of trade. But now he is persistently developing his core business. He sells brooms. This product has great demand in rural areas; since there are no machines, they clean their homes with the help of brooms. Suhbat buys brooms from artisans who weave them, and then sells them in his village at the local bazaar. This business brings a good income, and for additional income Suhbat sells cattle. His wife helps him to raise and sell livestock. He has one cow and a small calf. \r\n\r\nNow, Suhbat wishes to buy another batch of brooms to develop their business. Therefore, he turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to buy mops. \r\n\r\nSuhbat thanks Arvand in advance for the

She is married and has two children.  Makhina lives in a small village.  She loves her children very much and tries to provide them with everything necessary, so that they could grow, develop and realize themselves in the society.  For this Makhina is involved in her own business to have a constant income.  She buys and sells children's clothing.  She buys her merchandise at a large wholesale market and sells it at a local market in her village.  She has her own retail outlet.  Now Makhina wishes to expand the selection of her merchandise and needs to purchase more winter clothing because the winter season is starting.  This is why she came to Arvand and wishes to obtain this loan to purchase clothing.  Makhina hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1456208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy winter clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Makhina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":767.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":792.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":818.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":845.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":873.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":901.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":161.18,"local_amount":767.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":768.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550210},{"amount":166.47,"local_amount":792.75,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":794.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774431},{"amount":171.96,"local_amount":818.83,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":820.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673568},{"amount":177.61,"local_amount":845.77,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":847.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144358},{"amount":372.78,"local_amount":1775.15,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1778.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960178}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T22:55:19Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":623170,"name":"Merlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlene works hard to support her family.

\r\n\r\nHer husband owns a small livestock farm, the only source of income for his family. He sells sheep, goats, cows, etc. He raises livestock and then sells them in the market at a good price. He is the only person in the family earning a living. He has lots of expenses to pay for that include, gas, electricity, water bills, children's school fees, other household needs and livestock feed. In addition to all this, he looks after the livestock alone. His net income is too low to meet all these expenses. \r\n\r\nSarwar has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan with the goal of helping her husband to purchase feed and goats for the farm. This will help him to increase his sales, which will be helpful for him to gradually increase his net income as well.  \r\n\r\nSarwar dreams of her children's bright future and prays for her husband's good health. She wants to say that Brac is working very well in the field of microfinance, and she is very thankful to BRAC and Kiva for helping her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1456246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She previously accessed a PHP 30,000 loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories and to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. Her earnings were a big help in her personal, household, and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another loan, in the amount of PHP 20,000, to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs.

One of her sons goes with his father to help him in his daily tasks. Her husband owns a blacksmith shop in which he provides the services of welding. He also provides door-to-door services to his customers. Due to an increase in the iron\u2019s prices, he is unable to buy sufficient welding material, such as welding rods, soldering rods, etc. to carry on his business.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the demand of his customers and to run his enterprise, Haleema's husband needs some capital to buy welding material. Haleema requested a loan for her husband from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that he would be able to buy material to carry on his business. \r\n\r\nHaleema is very glad and thankful to

Her husband owns an unstitched clothing business which is the only source of income for the family. Presently he needs an additional capital for the growth of the business. Shumaila is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell, so that he can respond quickly to customer needs. With the help of the profit amount he will put aside some savings to pay for electricity and gas bills. Shumaila hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

Elnur is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his family in the Agdash IDP Settlement. He is a Fuzulu refugee. Elnur and his wife are engaged in their own business in order to have the income to meet their family's needs. He has been engaged in cattle breeding for the past 5 years. During these years, he gained the necessary skills and knowledge for the effective management of his business. \r\n\r\nHe usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, and then resells them for a profitable price in the livestock bazaar. He also makes homemade yogurt and sells it, together with fresh milk, to his neighbors. His monthly income is about 144 AZN. This business is the only source of financial income in his family.

She is married and her husband works in construction and farming. She only has a ninth grade education but in spite of that she has never given up in life. She has always worked in order to get ahead and her efforts have allowed her to set up a small business which is generating income for her family. \r\n\r\nAna is a very hard worker. Ever since she was very young she worked selling food like pastries, potatoes, enchiladas, and more. She has had her business for 22 years and learned it from her mother, who was always a street vendor, and that is how she learned. When she was about twelve, she was already going out to help her mother, selling door to door. After all of that, her mother became ill and has since passed away. This was a very hard blow for her, but in spite of it she has kept moving forward and decided to continue in the same business, but in a permanent spot. \r\n\r\nAnother way she makes money is by washing other people's clothing. That allows her to obtain extra income for her family. Her husband also helps her financially. Before she didn't have a business, only the experience her mother left her.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be to stock her business. She will purchase at least 500 lbs of potatoes, 300 lbs of corn, rice, oil, cabagge, and other items in order to have more product available for sale, because it is easier for her to buy wholesale than to purchase each day she makes her sales. This will allow this client to have better income for her household.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to expand her business a bit further in order to improve her children's situation, since one of her goals is to give them an education as best she can. She also believes that whatever little income she obtains will allow her to save up money in order to condition her home and live in something she owns."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1459759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy potatoes, corn, oil, and cabagge to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":43.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":48.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":54.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":59.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.83,"local_amount":47.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":47.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505352},{"amount":40.13,"local_amount":40.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":40.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716429},{"amount":33.42,"local_amount":33.42,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":33.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622053},{"amount":26.18,"local_amount":26.18,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":26.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215762},{"amount":352.44,"local_amount":352.44,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":352.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242616},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008213}],"funded_date":"2013-11-04T16:13:00Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:16:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":625648,"name":"San Antonio De Jicamarca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cSAN ANTONIO DE JICAMARCA\u201d es un grupo puntual en sus cuotas.

The coffee from this region has an incomparable taste. The region is also known for its cuisine and the warmth of its people, who work in different fields like agriculture and trade in general. \r\n\r\nKarina Consuelo is one of the members of this group. She is 31 years old and lives in a common-law marriage. She and her partner have three children, who are ages eleven, five, and three. The two older ones are in school. Her husband is a farmer. \r\n\r\nKarina Consuelo is a very good wife and mother who is requesting this loan in order to help her husband with his work. They grow corn, peanuts, and some vegetables. They are currently harvesting their corn and will use this loan to hire help from laborers. This will allow them to store the corn for a few months before selling it for a better price, since current prices are very low and selling now would result in great losses.
