Due to the need to make an income to support her family and supply the basic necessities in her home, she decided to start her own business. She opened a small business selling char-grilled arepas [corn-based Colombian snack] on the sidewalk in front of her house. \r\n\r\nWith time her business became well known by those living in the neighborhood. Little by little her business began to prosper which is why she had to find a storefront to rent and buy tables and chairs to better attend to her customers. She had good results and now the business has become a great fast food establishment. \r\n\r\nHer drive, insistence, dedication, and love of her children has made her look for alternative ways to get ahead, which is why she is requesting a loan. She wants it to purchase a cooler and wholesale supplies like bread, cold cuts, sauces, soft drinks, charcoal, and others.

She\u2019s been working in her own business 23 years, a small sewing workshop located at home.  The idea arose as a need to make clothes for all her children and use the money saved that way for other household needs.  Gradually people in the neighborhood started to notice her work and started asking her for the service.  Today, she offers her services doing alterations, making clothes to order and making household goods like bedspreads, sheets, cushions, etc.\r\n\r\nThis has made it possible for her to move her children forward and to continue providing support for her home.  She\u2019s asking for a loan now to buy another sewing machine and to buy supplies at wholesale (fabric, thread, zippers, elastic) which will allow her to improve her working conditions and shorten production time.  She will also be able to deliver good quality clothes that are excellently finished which will help her attract new customers to generate higher income to cover household needs and to continue advancing towards her main dream which is to own a house where she can spend her final years in a care-free old age.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1459858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Collence wants to get his own water pump so that he can effectively expand his production, and so that he no longer has to hire a water pump in order to water his crops.\n\nWater pumps can be a major boost for farmers such as Collence.  A water pump allows for farmers to water their crops more regularly, while also increasing the area they are able to cultivate.  Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a water pump can be very prohibitive, and many have to hire pumps from neighbors in their community or use buckets to water their crops by hand.  Once he secures a loan, Collence will be able to get a water pump from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it.\n\nCollence plans to use the water pump to expand his production of tomatoes and cabbages, and also to begin to grow other crops such as fresh greens and soya beans.  It is for this reason Collence is asking Kiva lenders to assist him with a loan so that he can obtain a water pump."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1459605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to obtain a water pump for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chibombo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Collence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":2610,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":193.49,"local_amount":1010,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-25T08:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449731681},{"amount":129.24,"local_amount":760,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-11T09:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":773.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.35,"payment_id":479254245},{"amount":153.83,"local_amount":840,"processed_date":"2014-08-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":854.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.09,"payment_id":517890751}],"funded_date":"2013-10-29T14:50:06Z","paid_date":"2014-08-18T09:32:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":625522,"name":"Kennedy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kennedy is a farmer from Chibombo District, Zambia.

She was born in 1976, is married and is raising three children. Her husband is a laborer and takes care of the household expenses. \r\n\r\nMehriniso decided to start a cattle business since she has helped her parents with their cattle since she was a child. She has been looking for help for a long time and finally heard about a course: \"Bring on Success,\" organized by the Association of Women's Issues. She took the course and got a lot out of it. She received a certificate upon completion of the course. Now she is ready to start her business, except that she lacks the money to buy cattle. She will be in business on her own. Mehriniso plans to buy the cattle, look after them for a few months and resell them in the local market. She is asking for a loan of 10,000 TJS to buy cattle. Mehriniso awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1457498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Here is her story:\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to choose which field to study at the American University of Central Asia, but I have to come to a firm and considered decision. It was quite an important decision for me because I will follow this major now and in the future. I feel that this  will significantly contribute to my future and plans. I strongly believe that upon graduating from AUCA, I will become a well-educated, responsible and professional specialist in the field of law.  \r\n\r\nKyrgyzstan is having many problems in many spheres. One of them is law. The Kyrgyz Republic needs more qualified and outstanding lawyers. I want to participate in political and social life in the future, try to help in developing and facing challenges in the future path of my country. The majority of lawyers usually become the heads of the countries. It is obvious that a random person never becomes a governor. For example, more than 60% of the presidents of the United States of America have been lawyers. \r\n\r\nThe principles of any democratic society are based on laws. To build a strong government, it is necessary to build a solid foundation. The foundation of the government is fair law. Law is one of the most important and difficult fields. \r\n\r\nI have always wanted to broaden the horizons of my worldview and my knowledge. I want to achieve goals in my life; these four years in AUCA will help me to realize my plans. I am an industrious and hardworking person and always try to be ahead of my schedule. Every time I have been able to  accomplish my objectives. \r\n\r\nI am happy to enroll AUCA because it gives a unique opportunity to all its students--everything except for a loan to cover their tuition fees. The loan is given by Kiva. I would like to apply for a loan, so that I will be able to cover my tuition fees.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1456433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Claudia works seven days a week from 10:00am until 8:00pm, and she also offers manicure, pedicure and hair salon services on the side to generate additional income.

She also plans to purchase merchandise in bulk to stock her office\/school supplies shop (markers, pencils, notebooks and other items). She hopes that this investment will help her to expand the range of services she can offer clients and will also allow her to generate more income to provide for her son and cover household expenses.

This is her first loan with Kiva, and she hopes that this investment will help her to strengthen her business and help her parents, especially her mother who is very sick."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1459938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase men's, women's and children's clothing, perfume, shoes, cosmetics and other products to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela De Los \u00c1ngeles ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.34,"local_amount":855.05,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T09:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":891.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439929832},{"amount":36.2,"local_amount":851.8,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T09:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":887.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449536364},{"amount":35.59,"local_amount":837.44,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T08:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":872.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459001320},{"amount":36.84,"local_amount":866.91,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T09:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":903.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467811581},{"amount":31.85,"local_amount":756.38,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T08:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":788.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":479034053},{"amount":39.66,"local_amount":933.14,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":972.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490730615},{"amount":35.79,"local_amount":842.08,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":877.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504158257},{"amount":35.75,"local_amount":841.12,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":876.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517441996},{"amount":136.72,"local_amount":3216.08,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3351.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529925981}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T02:50:11Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T09:34:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":625705,"name":"Jessica Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jessica es originaria de la Ciudad de Managua y madre de un hijo.

Tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda tener una peque\u00f1a tienda, en su casa. Ademas quisiera poder comprarle un molino a su hijo, para que trabaje en lo propio. \n\n","en":"39-year-old Doris only studied until the seventh grade as her father passed away and her mother could not continue supporting her education. Her mother took her to work with her to help out. Her husband is a farmer. Of her three children, only the youngest lives with her and is in fifth grade.\r\n\r\nDoris has made a living by selling clothes for 18 years, but a year ago she began her own business selling fruit and vegetables. She knows both businesses very well, since when her father passed away her mother taught her how to work in these businesses; that was how she learnt product marketing skills. The places where she sells her products are five kilometres away. She goes on the bus. Every day she gets up at 4:30am to get breakfast for her husband and her daughter, and then she leaves to sell her products. She returns at 3:00pm. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase more clothing, since two months ago she was unwell and spent the savings from the business. She has now completely recovered, but it is necessary that she begins work again since there are still household expenses and it is important to have income to cover said expenses. Granting this loan means Doris can continue doing what she likes most while earning income for her household.\r\n\r\nDoris has many dreams. One of them is to be able to leave her children a place to live in. For this it is necessary to remodel her home and construct a wall around the perimeter for safety. She would also like to have a small store in her home and be able to buy a mill for her son so that he can work for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1459941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Gulmira has secondary education and as a main source of income for her family she is doing animal husbandry which she started 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 400 som (KGS).

He now sells, taking in cash, and buys from various places in Barranquilla, as well as from a border town. In these places he finds wares at a good price, which he passes on to his own buyers.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his first one with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy bags, backpacks, suitcases, and satchels. Vacation time is getting close for many of his clients, and Ronald must be prepared with items that are well-priced, very comfortable, and modern.\r\n\r\nHis long-term goal is to have a large storage space and improve his living conditions, but his biggest challenge is the competition and the rise and fall of sales. So he takes advantage of every season, to make the most of it and increase his

She is 49 and married and has four children. The climate where she lives is very good for agriculture and also for raising animals. Therefore 22 years ago she chose this business and is developing it to this day. She sells milk to her neighbours, who are very pleased with the natural dairy product they receive. She also sells cattle that she has taken care of for several months. She wants to develop her business but does not have enough capital to do so. She is requesting a loan of 8,000 somoni to purchase cattle, in order to develop the business. She plans to provide her children with a good education and modern technology with the revenue she receives. She awaits your

Because of this they have saved themselves the labour cost which is very expensive.\r\n\r\nBoth of them are working hard to professionally educate their 11-year-old daughter. \r\n\r\nThrough the first loan that they received from AFODENIC, Sandra was able to whitewash the walls and change the roof of her house. This time she hopes to construct the front of their house, as well as lay a ceramic floor that she already has, for which she needs to buy construction materials like: blocks, cement, iron, doors and windows."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1459972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

She has run a silkscreen painting business for 2 years. She is well-suited for silkscreen design and painting. The tininess of her supply of capital often prevents her from making the quantities needed for resale.

","en":"Mosharif was born in 1961.  She and her family overcame many hardships in life.  She and her husband and their only daughter moved to another district because they did not have regular jobs in their district.  Having moved to another district, they were able to find a place of employment.  However, her husband passed away after several years, and she was left without a provider.  Mosharif worked as a dishwasher at a cafeteria.  She had a small salary.  Mosharif got seriously ill because she was depressed.  She was being treated for a long time.  Despite the bad state of her health, she started her own business of buying and selling women's clothing because she had to raise her daughter.  She has since married off her daughter.  Mosharif wants to increase her working capital.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of 6000 somoni to purchase women's clothing.

He lives with his wife and two school-age sons (14 and 15 years old).

She also supports two other people. She has worked from home for 11 years, dyeing all kinds of clothing which she then resells. Her business is very successful due to the good quality of her services, as well as her experience in this area, which has helped her build up a considerable customer base. Sylvie\u2019s concern, however, is that she will not be able to meet the needs of these customers, as her capital is so low. This means she has to buy products on a retail basis to meet one wave of demand, before waiting to be paid before she is able to meet the needs of more customers. She therefore needs a loan to help her buy bulk material to use for her work, allowing her to meet all her customers\u2019 needs and increase her income.

He\u2019ll also be able to meet customer needs and satisfy their wants.\r\n\r\nJonnathan states that he\u2019d like to continue working with much effort and dedication to reach his dream of enlarging his store and positioning it in the marketplace in such a way that it becomes more profitable and sustainable over time to ensure economic stability so he and his wife can enjoy better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1460250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonnathan Andr\u00e9s ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130874},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134491},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138209},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142030},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145956},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149990},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154137},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158397},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162776},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167276},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171900},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176651},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181535},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186553},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191710},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197009},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202455},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208051}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.21},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":623556,"name":"Ta-Tamtamneh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet members of the \u201cTa-Tamtamneh\u201d group from Waterloo, a town in Western Sierra Leone.

s\u00e1ndwiches derretidos, caf\u00e9s, entre otros; la idea surgi\u00f3 de la necesidad de generar los recursos econ\u00f3micos para aportar a la econom\u00eda de su hogar, pues se encontraba desempleada y las oportunidades de trabajo est\u00e1n muy limitadas en la ciudad. Su empuje, empe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n le han permitido salir adelante y ya lleva con su negocio 9 meses en funcionamiento, logrando que los clientes de la zona la reconozcan por los buenos productos que ofrece. Actualmente solicita el cr\u00e9dito con el fin de invertirlo en la compra de insumos al por mayor (aceite, verduras, salsas, mezcla para waffles, mantequilla, entre otros) y realizar adecuaciones al espacio donde est\u00e1 ubicada (poner piso para nivelar la mesa de trabajo y la freidora) adecuar una parte del espacio para abrir un parqueadero, esto le permitir\u00e1 ofrecer un mejor servicio a sus clientes, pues tendr\u00e1n la posibilidad  de parquear sus veh\u00edculos y poder disfrutar los productos en el sitio, adem\u00e1s esto le dar\u00e1 mejor aspecto a la imagen del negocio, abriendo la posibilidad de atraer nuevos comensales, lo que le permitir\u00e1 aumentar sus ventas y los ingresos que recibe de su labor.

At 31 years of age, she makes a living working her own business of selling food.  She is situated at the side of the highway that passes by the house where she lives in a well-known small town of the city.  There, she works alone every day, selling waffles, fried foods, melt sandwiches, coffees, and other things.  \r\n\r\nThe idea came out of the need to generate income to support household finances, since she was unemployed and job opportunities are very limited in the city.  Her drive, determination and dedication have allowed her to get ahead, and her business has already been running for 9 months, and her customers from the area recognize her for the good products she offers.\r\n\r\nShe is now applying for a loan in order to invest it in the purchase of wholesale supplies (oil, vegetables, sauces, waffle mix, butter, and other items), to upgrade the space where she is located (put in a floor to level the work table and the deep fryer), and to upgrade part of the space to open an parking lot.  \r\n\r\nThis will allow her to offer better service to her customers, because they will have the option to park their vehicles and enjoy the products on site.  Furthermore, this will improve the image of the business, opening the possibility of attracting new diners, which will allow her to increase her sales and the income she receives from her labor.\r\n\r\nThis is how Gloria wishes to continue getting ahead and in the future, realize her dream of opening a restaurant in a commercial location, that would be more profitable and guarantee

was born and raised in a Hmong village in Payao, a province in northern Thailand.  In her youth, she and her family moved from region to region seeking \u201cgreener hills\u201d and less crowded lands for farming.  She was a pioneer in the original group of Hmong who journeyed to Phrae Province and settled the Huay Hom Village.  From a small settlement, the village has now become home to hundreds of Hmong. \n\nKue\u2019s son has risen to a place of prominence in the community - he is a village headman.  Kue is proud of her son\u2019s achievements, but she has faced challenges as she grows older in a changing society.  Hard work is an important Hmong value - everyone is expected to contribute to the family, from their childhood to old age.  Traditionally, less physically demanding jobs were reserved for elders.  Older women would cook and make clothing while young adults worked in the fields.  Now that factory-made textiles and food have replaced the homemade, Kue and many elders face a quandary.  Many of them go out and work in the backbreaking fields to try to bring value to their families and maintain their dignity, often falling into debt-slavery as a result. \n\nFor Kue, hammock weaving is a way to maintain her pride and self-worth.  She feels confident in her ability to contribute to her family and tribe without taxing her health.  This loan will help Kue plan her workload for the coming year and ensure that she maintains her independence.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1461012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable

was born and raised in a Hmong village in Payao, a province in northern Thailand.  After her marriage, she moved with her husband and extended family to a large village called Khunsatan in Nan Province.  Unfortunately, they were soon forced to migrate again.  There was not enough land for their family to farm, so her husband helped lead a group of Hmong to settle further south, in Phrae Province.  Over the decades, this settlement grew into the village of Huay Hom and hundreds of Hmong people made homes there. \n\nA few years ago, Mang\u2019s husband passed away.  Like many older Hmong people, she faced a difficult adjustment due to changing cultural norms and the impact of the outside world.  In a society that values hard work throughout life, older women would traditionally have home-based roles (sewing clothes, preparing food, etc.). Factory-made clothing and premade foods have eroded their roles, leaving women like Mang without a clear role to contribute to the family. \n\nHammock weaving created a new opportunity for Mang to earn her own income and continue to contribute to the extended family's household she lives in.  Hammock weaving has made her a financial leader among her relatives!  This loan will help Mang provide for herself, manage her finances and enjoy a home-based job that allows her to work on her own schedule and spend time with family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1461018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to invest in raw materials so she can secure consistent weaving work and increase her income potential.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T19:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542704273}],"funded_date":"2013-10-29T20:55:57Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T19:06:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":626338,"name":"Maow","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maow grew up in a larger Hmong village about an hour away from Huay Hom Village, but as a young woman she took refuge in Huay Hom during a family crisis.

He\u2019s been in this activity 16 years having learned from his parents who were always interested in his learning.  Ever since he was little he\u2019d go out to the fields where his father worked.  He decided to go into the same line of work because when he married he had no other option but to grow basic grains in order to obtain food for him and his family.\r\n\r\nAn institution has recently arrived in his community that\u2019s helping them with technical assistance to grow vegetables which is another economic activity he has.  The place he works is about 500 meters from home and he gets there on foot; his wife helps him with the work which generally goes from six in the morning to two in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking for is to make a co-payment to the institution that\u2019s making available some of the materials needed for the vegetable planting.  It will make it possible for him to make the entire payment the institution is requiring and he will be able to have the benefit of the materials and be able to plant more vegetables to get a higher crop yield.\r\n\r\nHis plan is to continue working with the foundation to continue getting its support and to get a larger amount to expand the area he works installing an irrigation system to improve production.  He also intends to see that his daughter attains an academic level that will allow her to live in better conditions than the ones he was able to have.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1460672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to make a payment to his suppliers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":450,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":177.96,"local_amount":177.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":177.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505435},{"amount":272.04,"local_amount":272.04,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":272.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216627}],"funded_date":"2013-11-08T17:43:56Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":626340,"name":"Parichat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parichat was born and raised in a Hmong hill-tribe family in Chiang Rai province.

He has his business at his house.  He works from 7:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m.  That is why he does not have to go to another location to do his work.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan for construction of his house.

Since she was young, she admired her aunt, who is a saleswoman and taught her everything she knows about sales. Alongside her aunt, she started her own small business at age 16, selling dairy products and meat, and later expanded to various retail merchandise. Gradually, she expanded her customers among her schoolmates, so she decided to work with multinational companies to offer a variety of merchandise, like makeup and women's and children's clothing, through specialized product guides.\r\n\r\nHer knowledge of the market was the first thing that she practiced with her aunt's help and it allowed her to advance. Today, her goal is to build her credit history, so this is the first time that she is applying for a loan. She developed her business by going door-to-door, making sales in cash and credit with a frequency of 20 days, and purchasing products directly from distributors' catalogs. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of improving her access to finance, Angelly has turned to a Kiva loan as her first source of financing, and with which she will purchase beauty products, women's and children's clothing, meat, fish, and cheese. With her Kiva loan, she hopes to increase her sales and number of customers. Her ultimate goal is to have her own shop where she can display products. Her greatest challenge is to finish cosmetology school and learn English as her second language. Angelly, who is focused on her dream of prosperity, will eventually overcome the obstacles in her life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1460678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase beauty products, women's and children's clothing, meat, fish, and cheese.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":850000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":51393},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61435},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":63278},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":65176},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67131},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69145},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71220},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73356},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75557},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77824},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80158},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94327}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.72,"local_amount":51393,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":54085.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732234},{"amount":69.69,"local_amount":124713,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-23T09:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":131247.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415449},{"amount":376.59,"local_amount":673894,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":709204.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104586}],"funded_date":"2013-11-07T16:54:51Z","paid_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meghan Rishel","image":1056096}},{"id":623738,"name":"Violeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Violeta is 56 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

Avezkul has a secondary education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, Avezkul is involved in animal husbandry, having started 8 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Avezkul's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 bull, 4 calves, 2 sheep and also 14 hectares of land, where she annually grows clover and barley. The monthly income amounts to 6,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Avezkul requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Avezkul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1458477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Rovnoe village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avezkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":416.67,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":20274.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053393},{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40548.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178273}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T13:17:38Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:11:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":623736,"name":"Daisy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daisy is 37 years old and lives in Olingan, Dipolog in the Philippines.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nTeresita dreams to be more successful in business and hopes to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1128486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She said that two of her children are in school and they all live at home. She received a small amount of money from her husband to establish her business.

years old and lives with his mother. He is well known in his community and works as a mechanic in an auto shop. Wilmer's father taught him many auto mechanical skills, and 4 years ago Wilmer began working in the auto repair industry. In order to purchase replacement parts for use at the shop, Wilmer has to travel 30 kilometers in his car into a nearby city. With the income he generates from his job Wilmer helps support his mother.\r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan, Wilmer plans to purchase replacement parts for his own car so that he can continue using it for personal and work-related transportation. Since auto repair is Wilmer's business, he will do the repair work himself to fix his car. He hopes that this investment will help him to improve his quality of life and his effectiveness at work. Having a functioning, efficient car will also help him when he runs other errands in his car into town. Wilmer plans to continue his job and his participation with Fundaci\u00f3n Campo.

Francisco makes a living running several businesses, including wood and timber sales, raising and selling animals and running a small general store out of his home. He sells his goods on Wednesdays in the central plaza of town, which is located 5 kilometers from his home. Since the road from his neighborhood to the central plaza is in awful condition and cannot accommodate buses, Francisco gets rides into town in a car. He learned the agricultural and sales trades from his father, and he actually began working with his father in their general store at age 14. \r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan Francisco plans to purchase a waterhole that he can commercialize by selling water rights to farmers with livestock in the area.

was born and raised in a poor Hmong hill-tribe family.  More fortunate than most hill-tribe children, she was able to attend school and learned to read and write in Thai.  When Prapapon grew up, she married a young man from a Hmong family and moved to the village of Ban Huay Hom, about 50 km from her home. \n\nThe young newlyweds had a hard time building a life together and finding a secure source of income, despite their reputations as hard workers.  Prapapon was excited when she discovered the opportunity to weave hammocks and applied herself to learn how to weave every variety of hammock.  As more weavers were trained in the art of hammock weaving, Prapapon\u2019s reading and writing skills came in handy!  She helps decipher the pattern sheets for weavers who can\u2019t read. \n\nPrapapon is now 25 years old and has six children.

","en":"Aygul is 44 years old, a widow and raising three children alone after her husband's death and also running her own business. Avezkul has a secondary-specialized education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide additional income for her family, Aygul is involved in animal husbandry, having started 25 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aygul's hard work, today her business contains 5 dairy cows, 1 heifer, 1 horse and also 8 hectares of land, where she annually grows clover and barley. The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).

He is a widower, and he has children. He manages their household while operating his business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his family\u2019s everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLito operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for only one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 12, 000 loan. He will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings.\r\n\r\nLito dreams that his children will finish their studies and hopes that his business will flourish. He meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week.

never be possible. Marcelo was accepted into the Universidad San Fransisco Xavier, and now with the chance to achieve his dream, is concerned about affording tuition fees. He plans on graduating in February, 2014, but without a loan from Vittana he thinks that he may need to take time off to work and save until he can return to school. \r\n\r\nWith a loan, Marcelo plans on using the funds to pay his graduation fee. This fee is often more expensive than the semester's tuition and is a frequent impediment for graduating students in Chuquisaca. Marcelo currently works 30 hours a week. One of his biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. \r\n\r\nWith a degree in commercial engineering, he expects to earn $25 a day. With two younger brothers, Marcelo hopes to be a role model for his younger siblings by being the first in his family to graduate from university. Marcelo's father's salary is the family's primary source of income. For a family of five, finances have always been tight.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1456863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for graduation fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Chuquisaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":264,"posted_date":"2013-10-30T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-29T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelo Omar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":292,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":72.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.11,"local_amount":73.11,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-24T09:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450999164},{"amount":224.89,"local_amount":218.89,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":224.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459248477}],"funded_date":"2013-11-11T00:31:49Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T16:24:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":623790,"name":"Natividad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natividad is 62 years old, married with five children.
