Cristian was accepted into the Universidad Mayor de san Andr\u00e9s, and now with the chance to achieve his dream, is concerned about affording tuition fees. He plans on graduating in December, 2013, but without a loan from Vittana, he fears that he will need to defer his graduation. \r\n\r\nCristian plans on spending the loan towards purchasing his textbooks. As an added expense, textbooks are often not bought to save money. With them, Cristian hopes to be able to better understand his subjects. \r\n\r\nIn addition to his responsibilities at school, Cristian currently works 25 hours a week and earns $4 a day to help him afford his school and living expenses.With a degree in business, he expects to earn $10 a day. As the youngest of four, with two older siblings attending college already, Cristian is unsure how he will be able to finance his education on his own without the assistance of a Vittana loan. \r\n\r\nCristian's father works as a driver, and his salary is the family's primary source of income. Cristian hopes to be able to contribute towards his family's income in the near future.

She is married to Reynaldo and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNerissa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them as individual pieces. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNerissa dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

He works 3:00 AM - 7:00 AM in the morning, 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM midday, and 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM in the afternoon.  \r\n\r\nThe loan he seeks is to buy unfinished pots and pans that he then fires and distributes in the city market, enabling him to obtain greater economic income.\r\n\r\nArturo wants to open an artisan market in the town, with the support of his mother and siblings who also work as artisans and make different styles of products to sell to the tourists that visit the area.\r\n\r\nThe loan will enable him to purchase more materials to then sell in the market and obtain greater income; he will invest the earnings in more merchandise with the goal of expanding his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1460855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Since he was a young child he enjoyed working, specifically in agriculture, and for this reason his highest level of education is the 2nd grade. Nowadays, his wife helps him with all tasks related to their small-scale poultry production, and also with the cultivation of crops. They have two girls, a nine-year-old in 3rd grade, and an eleven-year-old in 5th grade. The girls also help their parents with household chores, and to feed the chickens when needed.\r\n\r\nFrancisco began raising chickens 8 years ago, when along with his wife they decided to launch this business. Part of his time also goes towards cultivating small plots of vegetables and selling them in the market; this helps him to solve some financial needs.\r\n\r\nWhen he has to buy supplies for his poultry production (chickens and feed) his wife helps him too. First they have to walk about 1 Km to catch the bus that takes them to the city center \u2013which is about 18 Km away-, and then, on the way back home they have to carry the supplies on their backs (sacs full of feed and crates with chickens).\r\n\r\nThis loan will be an investment to buy chickens and 200 hens, to improve the facilities (the chicken coops), and to buy feed. He wants to take advantage of the holiday season coming up, as the demand for chicken increases, as well as the market price during that season. This would generate greater revenue to cover the general expenses of the family, and he could also earn additional profits to invest in future productions.\r\n\r\nFrancisco wants to diversify his sources of income, in order to attain some financial leeway, so that in the case that one of these streams of income fails, he may rely on alternative income, minimizing investment loss.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1411042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and 200 hens, to improve the facilities (the chicken coops), and to buy feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-30T09:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-29T09:10:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215774}],"funded_date":"2013-11-01T23:25:03Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Cespedes","image":1446372}},{"id":626249,"name":"Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Armando tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa en la casa de su t\u00eda en la zona urbana de Cayalt\u00ed, una comunidad que se caracteriza por el comercio y agricultura, est\u00e1 ubicado a dos horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo en la Regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<P>\nEl es conocido en el medio, por su labor de servicio de transporte p\u00fablico (mototaxi) de Za\u00f1a \u2013 Cayalti y viceversa, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 1 000 nuevos soles para darle mantenimiento a su veh\u00edculo y de esta manera ofrecer un mejor servicio a sus clientes.\n\n","en":"Armando, 27, lives with his wife in his aunt's home in the urban area of Cayalt\u00ed.

La idea surgi\u00f3 de la necesidad de generar ingresos para aportar a la econom\u00eda familiar, pues estaban pasando por una dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n financiera. Aprovech\u00f3 la oportunidad de tener una escuela aleda\u00f1a a su casa y comenz\u00f3 vendiendo mecato para los estudiantes, poco a poco la demanda de sus clientes fue aumentando y el negocio se convirti\u00f3 en lo que es hoy en d\u00eda, una gran tienda de abarrotes bien surtida; all\u00ed trabaja con su esposo y juntos han podido superar todos los obst\u00e1culos y sacar adelante a sus hijos.

She is married and the mother of two children, aged 10 and 11 years old. She works as an independent merchant, running her own business. It is a general store she set up in the living room of her house. She got the idea out of necessity of generating income to support her family. They were going through a hard time financially. She took advantage of the fact that there was a primary school close to her house and she started selling pastries to the students. Little by little, her clientele grew and the business became what it is today, a great, well stocked general store. She works there with her husband and together they have been able to overcome all of the obstacles and get their children ahead. She gets her drive and her strength from her family. They have motivated her to ask for the help of the sixth credit cycle. With it, she hopes to buy merchandise wholesale (dairy products, meat products, pastries, sodas, grains and more). She will also do some improvements on her locale (painting the locale). This will allow her to improve the image of the establishment and positively change the the perception of the passers-by so that they can become potential customers. In addition, she will have more variety of products available to sell. This will help improve profits and income that she gets to continue paying for her household's basic needs.  Her only challenge, according to Mar\u00eda, is that the area where she lives is very distant from headquarters and sometimes she runs out of stock because the deliveries are late from the suppliers. Nonetheless, this doesn't stop her from continuing to fight with love and dedication. She dreams of the possibility of having a good business and turning it into a mini-supermarket where people can fill all of their needs and tastes. This will open the possibility of offering her children an excellent both in high school and college so that they can become upright people and enjoy a better quality of life.

own business.  Although she had experience selling jewelry in her home country, she faced many obstacles trying to start her own business in the United States.  \r\n\r\nAgossi worked hard to overcome these challenges, even taking classes to earn an entrepreneurship certificate at Lehman College. Four years ago she was finally able to open Sedak #1, a wholesale jewelry business. Currently, Agossi buys jewelry from China and sells it to several retailers throughout the state. She would love to start importing from other regions of the world, especially her homeland of North Africa. She believes there would be a significant market in New York for this traditional style of jewelry, but lacks the capital to make the initial investment.\r\n\r\nWith your help, Agossi would be able to purchase more jewelry and expand the designs that she can offer.

Clemencia is currently attending UDABOL, working towards her degree in commercial engineering. She expects to graduate in March, 2014, but without a loan, she is unsure how she will be able to continue affording her education. She says that her alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until she could return. \r\n\r\nClemencia says that it is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible. With this loan, Clemencia plans on using the funds to pay her graduation fee. This fee is often more expensive than the semester's tuition and is a frequent impediment for graduating students in Cochabamba. \r\n\r\nOne of her biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. With a career in commercial engineering, she expects to earn $25 a day, a substantial increase from before. \r\n\r\nGrowing up, finances were always tight. Unfortunately, Clemencia's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, her parents never had the chance to move up. With one older sibling attending college already, Clemencia is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her own without the assistance of a Vittana loan. To help afford her school and living expenses, Clemencia currently works 30 hours a week."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1456914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is married, and she has children. She manages her household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family\u2019s everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nZenaida operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for only one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings.\r\n\r\nZenaida hopes that her business will continue to grow and dreams of having a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of ther work every week.

The family members who work to provide for the family are her husband (in masonry and security at night), and one of her sons (in agriculture). \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan repay two loans that she has taken. She took the first loan because interests rates increased and the second to reduce the installments, so that there would only be one. When she acquired the second loan, it was supposed to be used to improve the home, but at that time, one of her children had an accident and died. So the money was used to pay for funeral expenses. They then had to take out another loan from another institution to complete the house. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that in the future her children become professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1459743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to pay two loans that she has taken.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-30T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-29T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ismelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":34.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":42.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.78,"local_amount":37.78,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":37.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505349},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":43.88,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":43.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716652},{"amount":31.19,"local_amount":31.19,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":31.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088286},{"amount":387.15,"local_amount":387.15,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":387.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902539}],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T16:38:43Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:46:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Huras","image":null}},{"id":626607,"name":"Indell 7 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe  INDELL 7 sont toutes  des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de  30 ans, 3 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles polygames \u00e0  Bandiagara, 5\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nBandiagara est une localit\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e \u00e0 90%  de falaise o\u00f9 les femmes ont comme activit\u00e9 principale la culture d\u2019oignon et de sa transformation en \u00e9chalote et sous produits.

She lives with her husband and two sons. Her husband works in the private sector with a very low salary that does not cover the expenses of the family. For more than 15 years the family has been extensively engaged in agribusiness. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her family members, Vardishagh is engaged in livestock, including cows and hens, and in the cultivation of beans, tomatoes, eggplant, pepper, alfalfa and several fruits (peach, apricot, fig, apple, pear and walnut). Her sons help her sell the agricultural products in the local market. \r\n\r\nAs the family's needs are growing day by day, Vardishagh wants to increase the number of livestock to effectively meet her family's needs. A loan of USD 2,500 will be a great support, enabling her to purchase two steers and some forage for the livestock. \r\n\r\nAs this is Vardishagh\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The First-Chance loan program provides loans to people who haven't had access to credit products before because they have no credit history. Vardishagh and her family will be very thankful to the lenders for their good will and support in collecting the needed loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1457292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The loan will be spent on more stocks, such as snacks, soft drinks, instant noodles, cigarettes, and mobile phone credit cards, and on electrical installation for her kiosk.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes that

On average, they are 36 years old and have three children. They all live in polygamous families in Bandiagara, in the 5th administrative region of Mali. \r\n\r\nNinety percent of the locality of Bandiagara is made up of cliffs, where the women cultivate onions and shallots and their by-products. The women transport topsoil up the cliff to create vegetable beds for their agricultural work. \r\n\r\nThey collaborate with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to maintain their gardening activities at the end of the rainy season.

The land they work is right there where they have their house.  She usually works from 6-11 in the morning which is the coolest part of the day.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s requesting will be used to buy fertilizer, leaf fertilizer and to pay labor costs to replace the guide-wires for the chayote vines she has to climb on.

He lives with his wife and daughter. Arshak and his wife work as teachers at school. Their salaries, however, are so low that they cannot afford a living, based on their salaries alone. \r\n\r\nArshak is engaged in beekeeping, which is an important source of income for the family. He sells the honey in the local market. As life is getting more expensive day-by-day, Arshak needs to obtain new beehives to be able to meet the needs of his family. \r\n\r\nA loan of USD 1,000 will be great support to Arshak and his family, helping him to purchase 15 beehives. Arshak has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately he wasn't able to return it. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, he was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. \r\n\r\nThe second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Arshak and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to collect the needed loan and to sustain their lives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1457358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her hometown is Kitwe, located in the copperbelt of Zambia.  She operates her own Zoona mobile money business in Choma, which is in the southern province of Zambia.  \r\n\r\nAngelina is a nurse by profession. In September, 2012, she decided to start her own business because her salary was too low to sustain the needs of her growing family.  When asked what she enjoys most about running her business, Angelina says providing a service to people who do not have bank accounts or are intimidated by the formal banking environment makes her feel like she is contributing a needed service for her community.  She also gets enjoyment from being able to employ others now that she is a businessowner.  Currently, Angelina has two employees.\r\n  \r\nAngelina is requesting a loan in order to serve more customers at her shop.  Currently, she is working with a very small amount of working capital, which makes it difficult to service her growing customer base.  She constantly gets calls from her employees in regards to needing more money to serve particular customers.  The loan will go to providing her the working capital needed to serve these customers, grow her business, and make the day-to-day operations of her business more efficient. \r\n \r\nAngelina is confident that she will be able to open additional mobile money outlets.  In doing so, she will be able to earn more profits and take care of her family better.  Her long-term goal is to one day own and operate her own health clinic.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4725,"image":{"id":1456653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To grow her business by increasing her ability to service more customers in need of financial services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Choma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-10-30T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-29T19:10:09Z","loan_amount":4725,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":296.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":4725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":450.09,"local_amount":2381.45,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2385.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449781130},{"amount":504.79,"local_amount":2762.29,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2766.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.28,"payment_id":459261912},{"amount":417.42,"local_amount":2325.97,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-18T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2329.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.19,"payment_id":468086444},{"amount":368.4,"local_amount":2200,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T22:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2203.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":47.4,"payment_id":479303828},{"amount":395.32,"local_amount":2245.9,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T21:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2249.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.16,"payment_id":491000284},{"amount":518.11,"local_amount":2882.4,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2887.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.66,"payment_id":504442345},{"amount":268.31,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1502.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.19,"payment_id":517719049},{"amount":266.3,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1502.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.2,"payment_id":531340950},{"amount":612.63,"local_amount":3536.12,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T11:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3542.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":55.7,"payment_id":562560118},{"amount":348.96,"local_amount":2007.86,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2011.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.53,"payment_id":579833150},{"amount":251.76,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1502.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":31.74,"payment_id":595362709},{"amount":26.03,"local_amount":158.01,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":158.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.83,"payment_id":610750938}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T00:09:04Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T13:46:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":623953,"name":"Oraib","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oraib was born in 1969.

Eduardo has liked working in the fields since he was very young. He would help his parents with different agricultural labors, like obtaining cacao and organic plants for the household.  As he grew and wanted to become independent, Eduardo asked his parents to grant him a half hectare of land so he could start his own future with his young family and first son.  Over the years, he gained better and better knowledge, and he tries with each productive season to obtain quality kernels by using organic compost. \r\nEduardo has two varieties of cacao, the common and grafted.  He has tried to progressively bring a more technical production, hoping it will give him a better income.  Nevertheless, he maintains lots of organic cacao trees, which produce naturally in keeping with his family's tradition. \r\nEduardo hopes, with time, to learn more techniques for getting a good, more technical cacao production and improve his income in the long term.

She has a common-law relationship with her husband, a farmer and loving father of five children. One of her children has settled down for marriage already and lives separately. She is a rice farmer who has been doing farming practice for more than 30 years. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband help each other take care of their crop to ensure a better harvest, which they sell in the markets of the province. \r\nDuring rice season, this family doesn't have enough capital to purchase enough farm supplies for their crop. Therefore, she would like to apply for a loan of KHR 2,000,000 to buy fertilizers to sow on her three-hectare farmland.

","en":"Qurbonali is 45 years old. He has spent 20 years of his life in the barnyard taking care of cattle. Raising cattle used to be just a side job when he was a carpenter and made good money, but now it is the main source of income for his family. Qurbonali has three cows in his barn and is diligently working to increase his herd. Having a large herd will mean that Qurbonali has a successful business and a secure future. Qurbonali is married and has a son, age 19, and three daughters, ages 18, 16, and 11. His eldest daughter and son are studying at university in Kulob, and the younger daughters are in school. \r\n\r\nQurbonali has asked for a loan to purchase several cows and calves. He hopes that this loan will help his business to really take off and that he will be able to continue to expand it in the future.

His son works as a barber at a beauty salon. He is requesting a loan of 4,500,000 MNT to buy an electric car. The advantage of an electric car is that it produces no harmful pollution at the tailpipe from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The car will be used for transportation, as his wife needs constant travel to the hospital due to her disability.

The family resides in an old house on a plot of land. He heads the department of supply at the military base. His wife sews clothes on her own and her daughter studies at university. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some repair. So, Bayarsaikhan is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to buy vacuum-insulated windows, hardwood floors and fiberglass. After renovation, his family will live in a comfortable and warm place where less coal is burned so fewer pollutants are released into air. The borrower is a very hard-working individual who strives for better future.

He does not have higher education but is a very talented young man. Neither of his parents are able to work because they are both ill. Nicat is a market vendor and sells seasonal fruits and vegetables from his spot in a central bazaar and from his home. He has a year of experience in his field, knows his customers' needs, and has reliable providers.\r\n\r\nNicat chose this business because it is profitable and brings a stable income. People use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy, and many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on every table of Azerbaijan's families and are made into fresh punch. \r\n\r\nWith a monthly income of 120 AZN, Nicat wants to repair his market stall but does not have enough funds. For that he needs a loan of 1000 AZN. This is the first loan he is receiving through Aqroinvest.

She has run her clothing sales business for  five years, having started it with her own capital. Her latest loan was invested in the business.\n\nThis is Mathilde's ninth loan which she will use to start building her house. She will buy concrete blocks and cement to raise some or part of her house walls. She will invest all this loan in this construction because she wants to keep building it with her business profits. The other construction materials she will buy are rods, sand, gravel, etc. She has a wood structure home and she wants to build it with a safer structure like concrete blocks and cement.\n\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in repaying their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business, and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their businesses and attending their group meetings. Mathilde thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity. In her name and that of her family, thanks to you for your support!

His wife helps him feed the animals.\r\n\r\nHis monthly income is 150 AZN, and Adalat wishes to increase it. As meat is in high demand, he needs more capital to put in his business to cover the market. For this purpose, he applied for 1,500 AZN.

She is starting out as an entrepreneur. Gulchera plans to start a business buying and selling cattle. She has planned out her business plan in advance. Her only restriction is the lack of funds. Gulchera has stocked hay for the winter and built a shelter for cattle. Now, she has decided to realize her ideas with the help of a loan. Then she will be provided with a good business and a good income. She is not afraid to do a large amount of work, because she can always get help from her husband and son. Her husband works as a cargo truck driver. Another son is working abroad. Gulchera has 3 daughters. They will be very happy if their mother has a business, and they would help her. She will use the loan to purchase cattle.

He was always interested in raising livestock. After all, this is a lucrative business and does not require much effort. In the yard of his home,\u00a0Sobir\u00a0has built a shed for keeping cattle and stocked it with hay and cattle feed. Now, in order to purchase himself cattle, he does not have the financial means and therefore he requested a loan.

She is the divorced mother of 3 young children who live with her in her house built from brick. She works in farming and grows products that are profitable in the area, such as cacao, coffee, barbasco and turmeric. She started with her husband 20 years ago and with her parents' help with money to buy her parcel of land. Years later, she separated and took on a double role for her children, feeling very motivated by this great opportunity. Her land is located 30 minutes from her community and she walks there to do her daily work such as weeding and maintaining the plants. For this she has the help of some workers, since it is a complicated and collective job. The products she is able to obtain with each cycle are sold in her community to the local warehouses where she collects her money and invests in each crop. One of her main objectives for the long term is to open a store for edible products in her house, hoping to bring in income apart from her labor. This is the second loan she has asked her financial entity for and she is described as being a very responsible member. At this time, she hopes to have 1,000 nuevos soles to buy tools and seedling plants to continue with her agricultural work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1461469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seedlings and farm tools.

As other villagers do, Ran is in the business of growing rice and other seasonal crops to sell. Her common-law husband is also involved in farming activities and helps her maintain their crops. This couple has two children living with them in their own home. \r\n\r\nRan wants to promote their health and live in good conditions. Therefore, she has requested a loan to buy materials and pay for labor costs to build a latrine. Having a latrine to use in the household means that she and her family members can live a healthier lifestyle.
