She is a single and hard-working woman who lives with her mom and dad who she loves and cares for in their own home which is located in the small village of Cumutay.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has been farming since she was 20 years old.  Her main crops are potatoes and peas.  What she most enjoys about her work is being able to care for her calf while she is getting rid of the weeds that grow amongst her crops.  What she doesn't enjoy are the seasons when farmers harvest a large quantity of vegetables as they flood the market and don't allow her to make good profits.  However, during such seasons she leaves her peas to dry and turns them into seeds.  She then sells the sacks of seeds for a better price in the central market in Tarma.  This allows her to stabilize her finances.  In addition, Elizabeth also spends her spare time teaching children under the age of 5.  She tells us that, as a young woman, her community bank plays a dominant role in her life since it helps her to grow and forge new goals.  Elizabeth is planning to open a restaurant in her area as there isn't one right now.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of the 'Pioneros de Cumutay' (Cumutay Pioneers) community bank and this is her ninth loan from MFP.  She hopes, once more, to receive your support in helping her achieve her goals.  For her part, she pledges to be punctual in making her loan repayments.  With your support, Elizabeth will invest the money she has requested in buying two bags of pea seeds which she will sow shortly.

Anatolia has been farming for 23 years. With great care and effort, she grows cacao and coffee. As a result of her production, she was able to acquire more space for growing these crops. Whenever she has to remove weeds or harvest her crops, Anatolia hires laborers to help with these tasks so that the work gets completed faster and she can stay on schedule. She purchased another piece of land where she currently lives with her family.\r\n\r\nAnatolia has one hectare of land that has not been cultivated, so she needs capital for planting cacao. For this reason, she has approached MFP since the organization provides loans to people of limited resources who are looking to make progress. For the sake of her work, she hopes to bring the same level of effort and energy that she demonstrates when she is raising her children.\r\n\r\nThis is her 15th loan with MFP and she hopes to receive the necessary assistance so that she can accomplish her goals. Anatolia promises to complete her payments on time, just as she did with her previous loans. The loan of 2000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy more cacao seeds so that she can increase her plantings. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":861507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anatolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":336278,"name":"Jehad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jehad is a 21-year-old young man.

This is 39-year-old Pelagia L. from Dar es Salaam. She is divorced with one child five years old. Pelagia has been running a poultry business since 2005. Raising kuku or poultry is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Her business is doing well. She works at the business for four hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Pelagia currently earns about 300 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 850 USD in order to purchase more chicks. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Pelagia thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":212549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more chicks for her poultry farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T20:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pelagia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T22:29:01Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348065},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970650},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886867},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436127},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130400},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027204},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613243},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010326},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232637},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664453}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T22:29:01Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":73202,"name":"Mujeres Trabajadoras Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This will be the second loan cycle for this group of five women.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

For twenty years she has run a store in her house, which has allowed her to improve her economic situation and help cover her household expenses.

Together they work until midnight, exhausted by the work and wanting to sleep, knowing that the next day they will have to work at the same speed, or possibly faster.

ages of 5 and 25 years. She lives in the Western Province of Rwanda, which is approximately three hours drive from Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Here Odette is the president of a group called \u201cAbakundumurimo\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis group has operated a business of selling a variety of drinks and food supplies for many years; in fact, this is the twelfth successful year of business for them! This bustling enterprise employs people who work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nAfter paying back their first loan in full and on time, this group is now requesting its second loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company for the purpose of expanding their business. They will use the loan to purchase additional and larger quantities of food supplies and drinks needed by a number of their customers.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, and assuming the members of this group are successful, they hope to earn enough profit to allow them to buy their own warehouse for their business. They dream of providing a much better standard of living for their families\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":431238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more sorgham and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Gisenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T15:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Odette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olive ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Penina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.87},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":221.88,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":126257.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782257},{"amount":221.87,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":126257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169359},{"amount":221.88,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":126257.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008351},{"amount":221.87,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":126257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037580},{"amount":221.88,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":126257.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760249},{"amount":221.87,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":126257.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022684},{"amount":221.88,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":126257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781760},{"amount":221.87,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":126257.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709639}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T21:45:32Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":159449,"name":"Victor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or R. es casado propietario de una carpinteria ubicada a dos cuadras de la agencia de la Fundaci\u00f3n de Lambare, cuenta con 30 a\u00f1os de antiguedad en la zona,  con una clientela formada.\n\nEste credito fue otorgado con rl fin de comprar insumos por el aumento de demanda de sus mercaderias y para la compra de algunos instrumento que se requieren en la carpinteria, con el objetivo de fabricar mubles mas finos y sofisticados como los consumidores desean.\n\nEl se\u00f1or R. expreso que la ayuda crediticia brindada por la Fundaci\u00f3n fue de mucha utilidad para el progreso de la actividad  que el mismo realiza y por ello esta muy agradecido.","en":"Mr. R. is married and owns a carpentry shop located two blocks from the Lambar\u00e9 offices of Kiva partner, Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya.

She has a beauty salon called \u201cSala de Belleza Mente y Arte.\u201d  She offers manicure, pedicure, hair drying, hair treatment, and hair cutting services, primarily.  She started her business 8 years ago when she didn\u2019t have a shop open to the public; she would go to her customers\u2019 homes to provide services.  In December, 2008, she took out her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  It was for $1.200.000, which she used to equip a salon in her home.  This time she hopes to use this loan, for the same amount, to buy a beautician\u2019s station, to improve the shampooing station, to buy products she uses with her customers, and to invest in publicity to reach a wider market.  Yadira\u2019s main goal is to modernize her beauty salon.  In the immediate future she wants to acquire the technology that will help her to better assess her customers\u2019 needs and to hire personnel to generate higher income and to be a source of employment.  She knows her work very well; that\u2019s why she extends her working days during periods of maximum productivity and she has special promotions on the less busy days.  The excellent quality of her services has situated her well in the marketplace, a reality that is reflected in her personal and family stability because household income has increased.  During the next year she is scheduled to participate in the Fundaci\u00f3n\u2019s business development program.  Thanks to the fact that Yadira is an organized and responsible woman, she attempts daily to learn how to manage her administrative operations, to evaluate her debt capacity, and to design marketing

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As most of the other people in the sector, he has gone through life thanks to the fertile lands that produce rice. He has raised 5 children thanks to the help of his rice farming. He is now hoping that he can receive a loan in order to improve his farm and leave his children with more productive lands. He has had 5 children in total and he is happy that they have grown up but still help him on the family's farm.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Dionicio is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T18:03:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionicio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-30T02:17:54Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21398},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:17:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40780},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:12:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45299},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:09:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99053},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:52:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106813}],"funded_date":"2007-04-16T02:17:54Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:52:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11754,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is 50 years old and a widow.

This leads to poor financial support and therefore poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The livelihood of most people in this village is made by fishing and selling fish. Though Helen\u2019s husband is not one of those, she supports the sources of income of other families by financing a fisherman\u2019s needs for fishing. In return for the financial assistance she extends to a fisherman, she receives half of the profit he earns from his fishing. \r\n<p>\r\nIt was seven years ago that Helen started this kind of business. She started with a very small amount of money from the savings she was able to set aside from her husband\u2019s daily income from being a driver. In 2004, considering the growing needs of her children, especially in education, Helen wanted to grow her business to further augment her husband\u2019s income.  Her oldest child and second child will soon go to college, while the next two children will be in high school, and the youngest in elementary. Helen knew she had to have more income. \r\n<p>\r\nSince Helen was able to have access to credit by joining the Kiva field partner, ASHI, in 2004, she has been able to finance many fishermen in their village. Now she is requesting a larger loan to finance the fishing business of her brother-in-law. Once fish are sold wholesale to a market fish vendor, profit will be shared with her depending on how much has been agreed upon. She also sells some of her share of fish for more income and profit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":383090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Her husband, Nelson, who is 39 years old, works as a pedicab driver to earn his living.  They have two children who are 9 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nAleciana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aleciana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,500 \u2014 increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's education. Aleciana A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married with no children yet. She is an employee with a decent salary; also her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Marwa wants to purchase necessary home appliances such as a stove, refrigerator, washing machine, etc., so she can live in better conditions. She needs to take out a loan from FATEN to pay for them. Getting this loan will offer Marwa the necessary home appliances which will make her daily life go easier and create better living conditions for the family. \n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext.\n \n\n

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ribbim now lives with his wife and their 4 children. They are also responsible for caring for his elderly parents. Ribbim is a farmer. Recognized by the people of the neighborhood as a serious man, Ribbim would like to expand his crop into a viable source of income. In order to do that, he needs a loan of 8000 Somoni to buy seeds and fertilizer to expand his crop. The income from the sale of this crop will then help him to cope with the needs of his large family and to educate all his children to a higher level of education. Ribbim is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Education of these three incurs a lot of expenses for Josephine and her husband to deal with. Her husband is a bus \"conductor\" (someone who is in charge of collecting passengers' fares and will command the driver to stop when passenger wants to ride or step off the bus), while Josephine has been making and selling \"nipa\" shingles. \r\n\r\n\"Nipa\" shingles is the most affordable roofing material in the province. This material is good for two to three years before it gets rotten. Poor people all over the province of Antique and those who live in very remote areas like the place where Josephine and her family live, can only afford this kind of roofing material. Therefore, Josephine thought of starting such a business. She will also be maximizing the resources which her village and community offers, because the \"Nipa\" plant is everywhere and a lot of people make \"Nipa\" shingles, however, they don't have access to marketing their product outside their village.\r\n\r\nJosephine wanted to address the issue faced by most poor people in their community. She started to grow her own business through loans she received from ASHI and she will still be expanding further by purchasing the products of people in her community to market in places outside their own village.

For 4 years, he has sold animals in the Central Market in the city of Lima, where he offers beautiful puppies, hamsters, cats, turtles, etc. He decided to pursue this business because he always liked animals. What he enjoys most is spending time with them. Because of this, his work doesn\u2019t make him very tired. The difficult part of his business is that sometimes the animals become ill and he must take care of them. Ricardo would have liked to be a veterinarian, but his work is the most similar to this dream. Happily, his wife and son share his love for animals, so they always work together to go forward. This is his fourth loan with MFP, and he has been very punctual in all of his repayments. With the money that he is now requesting, he will buy Shitzu dogs to raise and, later, sell at a higher price. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":362494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase his merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-04T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":375.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641676},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":375.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081116},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":375.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997266},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":375.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842610},{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734186}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T15:53:18Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":130593,"name":"Mercedita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercedita B., from the village of Mambajao, Camiguin, is 43 years old and the married mother of four school-aged children.

Gilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Gilma is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Gilma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She lives with her parents and 3 siblings and contributes with her brothers to the household expenses. She started her business selling lingerie from her home. Today, she is the proud owner of a lingerie shop. She has been working hard in her store for the past four years. Today, she is requesting to borrow $1000 from Kiva's partner Ameen s.a.l. to further diversify her merchandise selection. She hopes that her varied selection of lingerie will continue to generate good profits and enable her to expand her business even further. She expects her productivity and income to increase in the coming year. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in her picture, not indicating her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

It is made up of 7 hard-working women who know each other and are neighbors.  They are Ernestina R. Ram\u00edrez, who will use her loan to buy clay and white clay to make pitchers that she sells unfired; Petra Constantina V. M., who will buy clay to make pitchers; Luisa S. Gonz\u00e1lez, who will buy firewood, clay and white clay for making pots and casserole dishes; Maura A. V., who will buy clay to make rustic pitchers; Diana Mart\u00ednez L\u00f3pez, who will buy medicines, anti-inflamatories, syrups and analgesics to stock her pharmacy; Manuela S. S., who will buy clay and firewood to make pedestals and Gabina R. A., who will buy clay and white clay to make casserole dishes.\r\n\r\nLuisa S. Gonz\u00e1lez is a member of the group.  She is 36 years old and studied up to the 6th year of elementary school, obtaining her leaver's certificate.  She is single and lives with her mom and brother.  They work as potters, making pitchers, casserole dishes and pots.  Luisa is requesting her loan to buy firewood, clay and white clay to stock her business with supplies so that she has the material she needs to make her pitchers, casserole dishes and pots.  She started in her business 28 years ago, watching how her mom cut the clay, and she learned all on her own.  It is a family business and all her family work in it.  It is located in her home and is very important because she supports herself with it.\r\n\r\nLuisa enjoys being a potter, making casserole dishes and painting them.  She is proud because she works, bakes her products and everything comes out beautifully.  It has also helped her to take a stewardship role in her community.  There are 8 days of fiesta each year when they feed everybody and provide the church with floral arrangements and candles.  Luisa's customers are from Jaloxtoc, Ahuatlan and Tepetlixpa.  Her business is popular because of the good work that she does and the finishing touches that she makes to the pitchers, casserole dishes and pots.  The challenge that she faces in her business is the climate.  When it rains, the clay doesn't dry and she can't work.  Her business also faces competition because the whole village makes pottery items.  Luisa re-invests the profits that she makes back into her business, uses some to survive on, some to eat and some to repay her loan.  She is planning to stock her business with more material so that she can have some stored up.  She plans to continue working together with her mom and brother who will also help her to repay the loan.  This business has helped her family a lot.  It has provided them with the food they need and helped them to live more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThe improvement that Luisa would like to make to her home is to plaster it.  Her plans and hopes for the future are to continue working and for everyone to enjoy good health.  She is very happy to be receiving this loan because she will have money to buy the material she needs.\r\n\r\nSan Bartolo Cohuecan is a quiet village.  From it you can see the Popocatapetl and Iztaccihuatl volcanoes.  In the month of December, the Popocatapetl volcano turns red and they sow sorghum, corn, peanuts and onions.  Starting August 24th, they celebrate an 8-day-long fiesta dedicated to the patron saint San Bartolo (Saint Bartholomew).  They provide everybody in the village, and visitors, with food, there is music, bullfighting, fireworks, engagements and Aztec dances. \r\n\r\nThe members of this group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \"Many thanks for these loans that you give us.  We hope that you will lend to us at lower interest rates because the situation is difficult and let's hope the interest rates don't go up so that we have more money for our materials\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":715079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy firewood, clay, white clay for making pitchers, pans and casserole dishes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"BARRIO SAN MIGUEL, COHUECAN","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-19T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ernestina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petra Constantina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3591.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3669.24},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.41},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3829.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3911.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3996.3},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4082.52},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4170.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.1},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.41},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":301.24,"local_amount":3591.75,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3618.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850176},{"amount":622.13,"local_amount":7417.65,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7473.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292452},{"amount":984.43,"local_amount":11737.48,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":11826.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160710},{"amount":692.2,"local_amount":8253.12,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8315.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233584}],"funded_date":"2011-02-20T07:11:48Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":278939,"name":"Nuevo Amanecer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco D.

She did not continue her studies because she got married, but she later studied cosmetology and folk art.  She has 3 children and lives in the El Provenir district in Trujillo Province in the La Liberdad department.  This businesswoman works in folk art, both needlework and leather, which she began as a hobby.  She also sells cosmetics and clothing, and works for campaigns.  \r\n\r\nShe has been a working member of the Manuela Ramos Movement.  Her sister recommended her to the communal bank ESPERANZA DEL MA\u00d1ANA (Hope for Tomorrow).  She decided to participate in this bank because the doors were always closed to getting a loan elsewhere because she needed her husband, Aval, as a guarantor.  This was a challenge, because being a capable person, she was able to cope and even get ahead without anybody else's help.  \r\n\r\nWith the first loan of $1000 that she received, she bought threads, needles, knitting needles, and weaving needles.  With this loan of $425, which she will repay in 4 months, she intends to invest in artificial plants and dozens of poles.

She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu City. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard buying and selling eggs, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 31,800. Charie is borrowing PHP 9,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Charie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She started working because she wanted to buy land for building her own house. Yanet achieved her goal in three years and she would not have accomplished this if she had not worked so hard.  This by far has been her greatest achievement to date.  Now she wants to proceed with the construction by using solid materials in order to provide greater comfort for her family\u2019s well-being.  \r\n<p>\r\nDue to the expenses related to purchasing her land, she has not been able to save.

He lives in the company of his sisters in the home of his parents.  From a very young age he has helped with the agricultural work of his family, since he is the only boy.  When he turned 18, he realised that the money in the home was insufficient.  Because of this he decided to sow in rented fields, growing more carrots and spinach, and in this activity he has spent about 8 years.  Since then he has increased his cultivation, and his greatest wish is to grow more hectares of carrots, spinach, and lettuce, so that in the coming years she can convert himself into an important merchant in the market of the city of Tarma.  Edwing likes his work, as he is grateful to it for providing the money to cover urgent needs, and although sometimes he has seen his harvests shortened for the lack of money for fertilizer, he has not diminished his efforts.\r\n\r\nIn recent years he has gained sufficient experience to know what is coming and to raise his plants through the threats of various pests.  Because of this he is always observing his fields.  This is his ninth loan with MFP, and he has been very punctual in each one of his repayments.  With this loan he has a commitment to continue paying responsibly, as his role of the secretary of the community bank shows effectively, because all the members think highly of him.  Edwin has decided to invest the 1500 soles that he is asking for to fertilize his fields of vegetables, and in this manner to continue producing the best quality of the Tarma market.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":323135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-25T03:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwing","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733853}],"funded_date":"2009-05-25T05:18:22Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Kaminsky","image":56671}},{"id":114226,"name":"Oliva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oliva C. is currently in the business of distilling and selling local brewed alcohol, and she is requesting a loan to purchase brewing materials. \r\n<p>\r\nOliva is 38 years old and married.

Michael did not finish his college courses, and Melanie got married right after high school graduation. Edna does not want that to happen again with her youngest child.\r\n<p>\r\nThe hardest part of it is that the families of her married children still count on her and her husband for financial support. The source of Edna and Emelke's income is their mini-general store, which never provides enough money for their big family. \r\n<p>\r\nEdna now wants to start a new business, which is hog fattening or the raising of pigs. She is sure that this business will provide more income, because it suits their place. They have a big backyard for the building of the piggery house. Before starting this business, she needs capital that she can use to buy the piglets and their feed, as well as for the construction of the piggery house. She joined the Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), so that she can borrow capital to start her business.

He puts the food on his cart and sells it by visiting different streets of the city. \r\n\r\nBilqees has given birth to four sons. Only her eldest son was able to study till 5th and then started work to financially contribute to the family. \r\n\r\nBilqees has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for her husband who wants to improve his business further.

business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":772150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
