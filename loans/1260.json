As other villagers do, Ran is in the business of growing rice and other seasonal crops to sell. Her common-law husband is also involved in farming activities and helps her maintain their crops. This couple has two children living with them in their own home. \r\n\r\nRan wants to promote their health and live in good conditions. Therefore, she has requested a loan to buy materials and pay for labor costs to build a latrine. Having a latrine to use in the household means that she and her family members can live a healthier lifestyle.

He is a second-year student, majoring in law. Sokhkak, through savings from his small salary, could afford to pay for his first academic-year course. However, he now is facing difficulty to pay for his education fees again, so he decided to borrow a loan from HKL in the amount of 500 US dollars to cover his education costs. Sokhkak, pictured here, is committed to study hard with the funds from this loan. His parents, who are not included in the picture, will be his joint borrowers and also responsible for principal repayments. He expresses thanks to his parents and appreciates the help of people all around the world who have contributed to programs like Kiva via its partners, HKL which have supported his education

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, and she replied that they offer loans to small income earners.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked how this loan would benefit her family, Mary replied they will get more income because of the sale of eggs from the poultry, and thus a better life.\r\n\r\nMary owns cows and poultry but does not own pigs, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile.

He is married and has four children and has been doing farming for nine years.Ronald owns cows, poultry, and mosquito net, but does not own pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile, electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, and crops. Despite facing the challenge of low returns during dry spells, he enjoys mixed farming in general.\r\n\r\nRonald was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied, it gives loans at low interest rates. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: Every individual loan is given only if one is in a group. \r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is transporting his produce to the market. When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Ronald replied, they will be able to have more plantings due to the greenhouse and this will increase their income.

She began this work 18 years ago as she grew up in the countryside and was always was wanting to learn this craft. She has not had problems but different challenges due to her work preparing the sweaters, vests, and skirts for a fashion show that she took great effort to organize with other craftsman for performing on a Chilean national holiday (September 18th) and in early January. She hopes to buy yarn and processed wool that comes from sheep's fleece with the loan money she receives. She is very happy and excited to begin to make her summer knits and she knows she will do very well by selling these. She enjoys being able to share with the other community bank members which is what she likes most about working together with Fondo Esperanza.

Consequently she is applying for funds because she has received many orders as the Christmas season approaches.\r\n\r\nShe wants to buy molds, which she needs to replace, and basic ingredients such as chocolate icing and truffles. She is very pleased that she has already had so many orders and anxiously awaits receipt of the loan.\r\n\r\nShe greatly enjoys working with Fondo Esperanza because she has met many people who have helped her and she has gotten to know other ways of thinking that help her to gain experience.

She has dark hair and is holding a pen in her hand.  \n\nMarcela belongs to the communal bank Goleta Ancud, which is located in Ancud, Castro. The members of Goleta Ancud have a variety of businesses, including handicrafts, new and used clothing sales, cheese sales, frame sales, sewing, and d\u00e9coupage. \n\nMarcela sells American clothes and new clothes, but her strength is in American clothes, which she began to sell just over a year ago. At the time, she didn't have work and when she came into a bit of money she was able to buy a bale of clothes. Since this went well, she decided to continue selling clothes. Some time ago, she set herself up at a physical store alongside a business partner. However, she had problems with this partner and so she withdrew from the business. She decided to continue to sell clothes in the way that she started - door to door. She has been able to gain many customers in her time selling clothes.\n\nWith the money that she is requesting, Marcela plans to buy more bales of new clothes, since sales have been good but she doesn't have money with which to buy more, and her customers have been asking for more clothing. For this reason, she is sure that things will go well, since her customers are asking her to bring them more clothes. Marcela is happy with Fondo Esperanza's work, and grateful for the classes they offer, in which they provide training on how to look after your

When asked how this loan would benefit his family, Edwin replied that through poultry keeping he will earn more income through the sale of eggs and improve his family's living standard.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1457648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:46:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:46:14Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753655},{"amount":54.65,"local_amount":4372.08,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4636.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449658223},{"amount":29.32,"local_amount":2345.32,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2486.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343568},{"amount":17.92,"local_amount":1433.57,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479165118},{"amount":98.13,"local_amount":7850.66,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8324.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287260},{"amount":1.42,"local_amount":113.7,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":120.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570609},{"amount":54.63,"local_amount":4370.46,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4634.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530053962},{"amount":109.43,"local_amount":8754.32,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9282.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625437},{"amount":9.41,"local_amount":752.89,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":798.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824912}],"funded_date":"2013-11-20T22:05:24Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Allen","image":1340661}},{"id":624184,"name":"Sifa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sifa is 31 years old.

Margarita's husband helps her manage the agricultural products and the honey in the local market. \r\n\r\nAs the autumn is progressing, she needs to buy some forage for the livestock. A loan of USD 1,500 will be a huge support to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling her to purchase forage for the livestock (grass and barley). \r\n\r\nShe took a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to recent hard work, Margarita was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history, and have no access to credit products. \r\n\r\nMargarita and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for
