He is asking for this loan and hopes for lenders' support. Valeri has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan is very important for Valeri to be able to continue his business and improve his family's living

The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nThe loan is very important for Harutyun to have the tools he needs and be able to provide better service for his

A year ago Bagrat started up his furniture-making business. After this time of hard work, now he receives many orders and is able to sustain his family\u2019s living. \r\n\r\nBagrat is the main breadwinner of the family so it is very difficult for him to cover his family\u2019s needs and at the same time save money for his input costs of production. So he has applied for this loan for purchasing materials needed for the production of furniture. Bagrat has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan will be a great support for Bagrat and he hopes for lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1457606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

","en":"Gulkayir is a 39 years old widow raising three children by herself.  Gulkayir has a secondary education and has very good reviews from her neighbors. They refer to her as a kind and hard-working woman. Gulkayir is the main source of income for the family.  Since 2006, she has worked as a vendor selling food and sweets, having started this business with 20,000 KGS. She sells food items and sweets out of a container. Thanks to her hard work, Gulkayir has been able to develop and expand her product.  Her business brings her about 20,000 KGS per month, which helps pay for the cost of food and other household needs for the family. The income she has received from the business has allowed Gulkayir to expand her trade. In order to further develop her business, Gulkayir has appealed to the \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" Microfinance Bank for a loan in the amount of 130,000 KGS for the purchase of wholesale food and sweets for resale.  Gulkayir will use the income from the loan to help increase turnover and the increased profit will help her raise and educate her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1459203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

His son helps him realize the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of income for the family. In the present difficult living conditions, Hasan is hardly able to cover the needs of his family, and is eager to expand his agribusiness in order to take care of the family more effectively. A loan of USD 3,000 will help him greatly, enabling him to purchase cellophane, bottles, and cable for building a greenhouse, and to buy fertilizers. The loan will support him in sustaining his agribusiness.

She has the equivalent of a high school education, and raises livestock for a living, having started 26 years ago with 1,000 somoni worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, she currently has a dairy cow, 2 calves, and 15 sheep, and her monthly income has grown to around 10,000 somoni.  To further develop her farm, Gulbara is seeking a loan of 135,000 somoni from Bai Tushum and Partners to buy cows.  She plans on using the extra money that this loan will allow her to earn to continue buying more livestock for her farm, as well as to set aside money for her son's

farm to boot.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and raises livestock for a living, having started 46 years ago with 1,000 somoni worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, she currently has a dairy cow and 15 sheep on her farm, while her monthly income has grown to nearly 8,000 somoni.

She has a higher education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business eight years ago with the purchase of livestock for 6,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to Kanimet's hard work, her farming business now comprises one dairy cow and ten sheep.

Thanks to Azizkan's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 calf, 2 horses and 13 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 16,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Azizkan requested a loan in the amount of 65,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls in order to increase livestock headcount. Azizkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to purchase a car.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1459362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

bread: shoti. He is a 27-year-old, married and lives with his underage brother, mother and wife. The only one who earns money in the household is George\u2019s mother, who works as a nurse and takes care of old people. Her monthly salary is nearly $120. The family gets small-sized social assistance, as they live below the poverty line. \r\n\r\nIn order to generate income, George decided to start this business. He estimates his business will be lucrative, as there is high demand for bread in his village, and he has the proper experience in baking. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, George will renovate the old bakery located in his yard and purchase firewood and flour.

She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\n\nIsatu requested a loan in order to purchase different types of rubber slippers to expand her business.

She is married with 4 children. Her husband is out of a job so she has to take care of her family alone. She began her business because she wants to be self-dependent. In 2002, Mabinty established her general stock business.  She works at the business 9 hours per day, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nMabinty requires a loan in order to purchase more items like cigarettes, biscuits, soap and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and have a permanent business location. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mabinty plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1457675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She works at the business from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nHawa requires a loan in order to purchase more slippers to expand her business.

She is married to a businessman with 5 children but her husband's income is not enough to care of the home.  She began her business because she wanted to be self-dependent. In 2006, Makaprr established her general store business.  She works at the business 9 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nMakaprr requires a loan in order to purchase more items like cigarettes, biscuits, soap and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and repay her loan. In the future, Makaprr plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1457787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She began her business because she needs to create income to support the home. She works at the business ten hours per day and seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nEsther requires a loan in order to buy more wax cotton for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her standard of living. In the future, Esther plans to own a big shop.

He lives with his partner in the Barrio La Dolorosa de Atuntaqui. He is a person who has always fought to bring money home to his family. Miguel sells grains in the city's local market. He sells every day, walking from his home to the market as he does not have a vehicle; renting one would be very costly, and he does not like travelling by bus because of the crime and the danger of falling or losing his merchandise. Despite his age, Miguel is an energetic person who also plays sports in his spare time after the market. He plays volleyball with neighbourhood youth, and is well-known for all of his activities. \r\n\r\nHe wants to invest this loan in the purchase of grains to increase his sales, because during this season sales improve as he works from 8 in the morning to 2 in the afternoon and has customers all over the city. He also makes bulk sales to those who request it. It is certain that this loan will improve his quality of life and that of his partner. As well, he will have the chance to save for the health expenses he will need in his old age. \r\n\r\nHe is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for helping to increase his sales from the first loan

He attended school in his village up to sixth grade. He is married and his wife takes care of the household chores. They have a son in kindergarten, who Oscar's wife looks after when Oscar goes out to work. His mother and brother also live with them.\r\n\r\nOscar's job is growing basic grains like beans and corn. He has carried out this work for about 15 years, since he was a little boy working with his father. When he got married he had no other option than to carry on working so he could feed his wife and child. His agricultural work is his only means of providing for his family, and the land he works is located behind their house. He goes out to work at 6 in the morning and comes home at 2 in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nOscar is asking for a loan because he has found an institution who will give him technical advice and some of the materials he needs for planting vegetables and installing a small irrigation system, but in return he has to make a payment to the institution's account to cover the costs. This will enable him to achieve a better yield and help cover his family's basic needs. He will be happy to not have to go out looking for someone to lend him the money.\r\n\r\nIn the future he hopes to go on providing for his family, to increase his land and to be able to take advantage of the water resources that exist near where he works. He would also like to improve his home, as there is a part of the corridor where a lot of water comes in, which is ruining the wood and will cost him more to fix the longer it is left.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1461508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay an institution which will give him technical advice and some of the materials he needs to plant vegetables and to install a small irrigation system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:47:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:47:31Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Arnulfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216628}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T23:50:08Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Brown","image":560642}},{"id":626761,"name":"Rubidia Noem\u00ed","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Rubidia de 34 a\u00f1os, estudio bachillerato en el instituto nacional.

It\u2019s necessary to make an investment to have more sales options for consumers.\r\n\r\nRicardo\u2019s dream is to earn a high-school diploma which is why he\u2019d like to restart his studies next year.  As for the business, he hopes to have a market stall to display his merchandise and if he\u2019s unable to do this he\u2019d like to buy a motorcycle to head out to sell his goods to the usual places he goes to but somewhat easier now thanks to the motorcycle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1462156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:47:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:47:31Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":36.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":42.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":44.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":49.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.99,"local_amount":75.99,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":75.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716447},{"amount":39.92,"local_amount":39.92,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":39.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622071},{"amount":38.66,"local_amount":38.66,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":38.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088304},{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":41.79,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":41.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902555},{"amount":42.03,"local_amount":42.03,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":42.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215777},{"amount":43.78,"local_amount":43.78,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":43.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817144},{"amount":44.47,"local_amount":44.47,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":44.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242629},{"amount":45.88,"local_amount":45.88,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525712},{"amount":127.48,"local_amount":127.48,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":127.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008222}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T19:27:42Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:16:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":626755,"name":"Mar\u00eda Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 37 a\u00f1os,  no estudio, ya que la escuela le quedaba lejos de su casa y por el conflicto armado en esa \u00e9poca se le dificulto.

He has been doing this work for 16 years and learnt in the evenings by working in carpentry workshops. Before that he was studying. He decided to do this since in his hamlet everyone does the same work. He has only ever worked as a carpenter and has never done any other kind of work. Yuris's carpentry workshop is in his home, but he has to travel some 10km to deliver the furniture which he makes to a saleswoman. He works from 6am to 6pm.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for is to buy a motor and a calf. The motor, because it is the life of his workshop and without it he cannot get on with his work. The calf he hopes to fatten so he can sell it after a couple of months and make a profit.\r\n\r\nYuris wants to extend his workshop more, to increase his deliveries and earn more.

However, she is able to save only 2 US dollars per day after deducting all of her expenses. \n\nLay has never been with Kiva's partner, VisionFund, before.

conservative communities. She built her business in a simple, honest, step-by-step process, gaining the respect of her family and her community, showing an attainable business model to many.\n\nAwatef is the owner of a beauty salon, a hair dresser and beautician, a wife, and a mother of two children. She is 48 years old and has faced many challenges. She not only tackled them but also made the best of them. When safety and security issues were putting many families in danger in Iraq, Awatef and her family had left the country to stay in neighboring for Syria and Lebanon for a while. While out of the country, she decided to continue her education and gained knowledge of various beautician techniques unavailable in Iraq. This knowledge gave a little advantage, but she certainly had to walk her career path step-by-step.\n\nAt first she worked in a beauty salon, where she worked for a wage for about 4 years. She then decided to work on her own and start to slowly build up her own clientele working from home. After about 2 years of working out of her home she was able to open a Salon on her own. The Beauty Salon has now been in operation for 4 years. Awatef provides a range of services to her female customers, who - in addition to receiving their hair and beauty treatments - can also see and experience first hand how a woman can grow a business, and how a woman can grow in the eyes of society. \n\nManaging a beauty salon may not seem like a unique task or a world changing endeavor, but it is indeed. Because behind the walls of the salon there are many opportunities, behind the walls is a hard working women, behind the walls is place where women have a chance to learn from each other, behind the walls is a role model for opportunities to grow.    \n\nAwatef is now ready for her next step and further growth as she started to expand her business, and she already started the construction works on the new room to be added as an area for new services: a special area for brides to get ready, a corner for facial peeling, and even some fitness equipment. \n\nAwatef's growing business and her positive attitude qualified her to participate in the WLIFT program and her business is taking a SME loan in the amount of 14,000 for the expansion works and interior finishes.\n\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":14000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":14000,"image":{"id":1461068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Her major challenge is the seasonality of her business. There are times when she sometimes fetches little profits which do not help in providing all the basic needs for her family or allow her to plow back into the business. \r\n\r\nAsiya is honest and hardworking.

This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I was born in El Salvador to a large family of seven children and parents who were farmers. They taught us the value of hard work, discipline, and honesty. \r\n\r\n\"When I was 16, I got married and I had my first daughter at the age of 17. Several years later, my dear Aunt Adelfa patiently began teaching me to sew and embroider; she was a true artist.  I perfected my skills and techniques and I developed my own style. \r\n\r\n\"I've taught many people since then, mostly women such as single mothers, who have been able to support their children with these skills. \r\n\r\n\"I began in 1973 and, today, I've built up a family workshop. My husband is the administrator and helps with delivering orders. My son takes care of planning, sales, and marketing. I do the designing and look after the production, from start to finish. \r\n\r\n\"Our main material is cotton fabric, woven by hand in a nearby town. I'm passionate about this art. It is closely related to the history and traditions of our country. My designs use many motifs representative of Maya art.\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to receive this microcredit to invest in my workshop. Thank you so much for your support of artisans like me.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1457716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in a bulk purchase of cotton fabric for her apparel.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Cojutepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.716667 -88.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:49:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:49:11Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":5.13,"local_amount":5.13,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449718865},{"amount":60.19,"local_amount":60.19,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":60.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459197636},{"amount":51.81,"local_amount":51.81,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":51.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468016980},{"amount":84.13,"local_amount":84.13,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T17:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":84.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240307},{"amount":82.2,"local_amount":82.2,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T17:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":82.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490936656},{"amount":10.26,"local_amount":10.26,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T16:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":10.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504374429},{"amount":10.26,"local_amount":10.26,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T15:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517651947},{"amount":36.94,"local_amount":36.94,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T15:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":36.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530130970},{"amount":359.08,"local_amount":359.08,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":359.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542632883}],"funded_date":"2013-11-02T16:58:33Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T16:12:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":6,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":624787,"name":"Gladys' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys, who is in her late thirties, is married with four children who are all in school.

Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband owns a general store at home; he has allotted a portion of his house for the general store. One of his drawing rooms opens toward the front side of the street, and he is using that room for general store. He offers many items, such as rice, flour, pulses, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap and biscuits. He has been running this business for many years and feeding his family in a good manner. \r\n\r\nHis shop is situated under the street, and this is the reason only a few customers are attracted toward the shop. Because of this, he decided to move the general store toward the market. His children are growing up, but there is not enough space left at home for their privacy, so the store needs to leave that drawing room. But he does not have funds to hire a shop, to open the general store in another place.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Azra requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will provide the loan funds to her husband, to enable him to hire the new shop, for moving the general store toward the market. She praises for this cooperation, and says thanks to, Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

Pakistan. She is very motivated to provide them with a beautiful life, with good education, food and clothing.\r\n\r\nSince many years her husband has been successfully running a business of milk selling, in his locality. Over time, he has become well-known in the area, for providing good-quality milk. He also sells butter and cheese, to generate an extra amount of profit. He has to spend the maximum part of his income for fodder to feed his cattle. He gets milk two times in a day. He has three buffaloes at home, which are very few for getting enough milk to sell.\r\n \r\nFor the growth of the business, Razia wants to buy another buffalo for getting more milk to sell. But she does not have enough money to buy a buffalo. Therefore, Razia requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will use the loan for her husband to buy another buffalo, for getting more milk. Razia hopes to get an increase in the production of milk, which ultimately will help in generating more money.

He uses a part of the unsold milk for making yogurt, butter and cheese, and for his family's consumption. He has a few head of cattle that provide him with milk, which he sells to earn money. He needs the loan to purchase another dairy cow, which will increase milk production and increase profits for his family. Inflation is increasing day by day and his family's needs, too.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Suriya requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will provide the loan funds to her husband, so that he could buy a cow for getting more milk to sell.

Now the rickshaw requires proper maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. For this reason, Shumaila has applied for a loan from Kiva's field partner, BRAC Pakistan, for her husband. He wants to buy new tires and provide some engine maintenance needed for his vehicle. This will help him to drive more smoothly and provide better transportation services for his passengers. \r\n\r\nShumaila is hopeful that this loan will be a productive one for her husband and will bring positive changes to his business.

Ella actualmente est\u00e1 cursando su primer a\u00f1o de escuela siente la necesidad de hacerlo ya que en su ni\u00f1ez no pudo estudiar porque sus padres no contaban con los recursos econ\u00f3micos para apoyarla en su educaci\u00f3n.\nDora desde hace 25 a\u00f1os  se dedica a la agricultura junto a su esposo al cultivo de caf\u00e9, ma\u00edz y frijoles por lo que cuenta con mucha experiencia en esta actividad. Todas las ma\u00f1anas junto a su esposo recorren 20 minutos en una cuatrimoto que con mucho esfuerzo adquirieron para llegar a  su finca ya que son carreteras que en esta \u00e9poca se deterioran por la lluvia. Juntos trabajan con muchas ganas y distribuyen su tiempo para preparar su terreno y sembrar las plantas de caf\u00e9 que planean comprar con el financiamiento que solicitan, tambi\u00e9n abonan y cuidan la parte cultivada de caf\u00e9 que ya tienen, con el af\u00e1n de obtener una excelente cosecha y poder vender a los intermediarios que llegan a la localidad donde est\u00e1 ubicada su finca.\nPor lo que  ella necesita financiamiento para la compra de 4,500 plantas de caf\u00e9 para resembrar una parte de su finca que est\u00e1 deteriorada y pagar mano de obra para tener su finca en excelentes condiciones.\nDora sue\u00f1a en un futuro que su finca sea sostenible ya que ella y su esposo son personas adultas y necesitan mejorar la econom\u00eda de su hogar, por lo que siguen luchando para hacer crecer su finca sembrando y cultivando caf\u00e9 de calidad, d\u00e1ndole el mantenimiento adecuado.\nAdem\u00e1s a su edad anhela cursar al menos la primaria completa ya que las circunstancias no se lo permitieron en su ni\u00f1ez y as\u00ed sentirse orgullosa y un d\u00eda contarles a sus nietos que en la vida todo es posible si se lucha por lo que una desea.\n","en":"Dora is a very enterprising 54-year-old woman. She is married and has seven adult children. She lives with her husband, one of her sons, her daughter in law, and her little granddaughter. She is currently attending her first year of school. She feels a need to do so because she wasn't able to go to school as a child, since her parents didn't have the financial resources to support her in her education.\r\n\r\nDora has been farming with her husband for 25 years. They grow coffee, corn, and beans, so she has a lot of experience in this business. Every morning she and her husband travel to their land, a twenty-minute ride away, on the quad the acquired with much effort, because in in this time of year the roads are deteriorated by the rain. They put a lot of effort into their work and dedicate time to prepare their land and plant the coffee plants they plan to purchase  with the loan they are requesting.

So I decided to choose applied mathematics and informatics to expand my knowledge of these subjects, to deepen my knowledge. But that is not the only reason. The other reason is to improve myself in ways my future faculty may offer me \u2013 logical thinking, programming skills. This choice of mine gives me a lot of opportunities in the future. With logical thinking, good knowing of all mathematics aspects I will be able to work not only as a programmer, but as a teacher or accountant. In general, I can choose any profession related to mathematics or informatics. By choosing this faculty I won\u2019t meet such problems in future, as low level of employment or low salary. Studying this subject gives me a lot of improvements in myself, which is going to help not only my job, but in my life also. \r\n\r\nI cannot imagine my life without mathematics. Everywhere I go \u2013 I use mathematics, even when I\u2019m driving or just walking, because it is interesting. But the level of my knowledge is not enough for me. \r\n\r\nI think I made the right decision enrolling the American University of Central Asia. I will achieve my goals, studying here. AUCA gives lots of great opportunities to its student, which one cannot get in any other university of our country. One of those is financial support. AUCA gives financial support to each student. Therefore I would like to take an opportunity and apply for Kiva loan. It will help me to cover my tuition fees and become who I want to.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1458182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

We develop our skills by mastering knowledge. Studying any information in detail to determine for ourselves what is now and what will happen in the future. As for me, every step is thought by myself. \r\nI decided to enroll at AUCA, Department of Journalism and Mass Communication. My ambition in this direction had not formed in the last year, where I studied. I was a student of New Generation Academy of AUCA. The past year has given me more motivation than I had previously had. AUCA is the best place for the development of skills. The main emphasis is that the university gives you freedom of any initiative. During my studies, I realized a few ideas and shared them with my fellow students. One was to set up an initiative group called \u201cMedia Group\u201d, which is engaged in the dissemination of information about our academy and work on development of the command system. The group work was fertile, for which we were awarded at the end of the year. Of course, the success of this group was the effort of the entire team, but I would like to mention that it was all happening within AUCA. Now I am very happy to have been a student of AUCA, JMC department. Another opportunity that AUCA gives to every student is a Kiva loan. It is what can make dreams come true. \r\nI am applying for the loan as I have financial difficulties and am not able to cover my tuition fees fully.\u201d

To accomplish my goals in my life, it is necessary for me to overreach an education after my preparatory program at this university. I think that AUCA is the right place to acquire a high level education. Since my childhood, I have been interested in diversity among people and cultures and I developed a great passion to learn about them. Therefore, I enrolled in the department of Anthropology. Studying in the department will give me an opportunity to express what I want to do and where I want to be in my life. My ability to know new things and use them to my advantage will surely be beneficial in furthering my education and career. I believe that if I study hard, stay focused and strive for what I believe, I will be rewarded greatly. I strongly believe that one day I will achieve my goals and reach my dreams. \r\nAUCA gives a unique opportunity to all the students providing them with a loan.

Because of the decisions they will have to make for their future. It is easy to get lost in the great diversity of universities. I have chosen AUCA. Competition has become more and more drastic and a prestigious job will attract hundreds of candidates to apply. Only those who have a good educational background can get good job. AUCA is the best university in Central Asia. \r\n\r\nGraduates of AUCA have more opportunities than graduates of other universities. The approach of professors and the system of education is very different from other universities. Students really enjoy spending time at the university. Here students are given an opportunity to grow, prepare for future independent life, learn to think creatively and communicate with representatives of other nationalities and cultures. \r\n\r\nI passed an annual training in New Generation Academy at AUCA, which allowed me to acquire knowledge required for admission to AUCA. Among other opportunities that AUCA gives to students, one of most important is financial support. All AUCA students are eligible to apply for financial support, which is very helpful to them. I would like to take an opportunity and apply for a Kiva loan that will help me to cover my tuition fees.\"

Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cNowadays, choice of profession plays the main role in one\u2019s life. One should enjoy their job, therefore they should choose the right profession. I am interested in anthropology, because I loved history while studying at high school, and I also love working with people. My studies at New Generation Academy in AUCA greatly impacted my choice. AUCA gives a great opportunity to learn anthropology. The professors are highly qualified. I would also like to study archeology as part of anthropology because it is more about the mode of life and culture of ancient civilizations based on preserved remains of their life existence. Anthropology is also a creative profession, because you need to use your imagination and abstract thinking to recreate the pristine view of the world of the past. My goal is to study humans at physical, psychological and social aspects. \r\n\r\n\"Another opportunity that AUCA gives to its students is loans. I would like to apply for Kiva loan, which will help me to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1457474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for her higher education in anthropology.

Specifically, he breeds two cows, a pig and grows walnuts and grapes on the family-owned land. The family lives in poverty and gets small-sized social assistance from the local government. \r\n\r\nIn order to generate income and feed their children properly, Mikha and Ella decided to start a clothing trading business in their village.

She lives with her son and daughter-in-law. \r\n\r\nGeghanush works in the private sector. The salary that she gets is not enough to meet her family's needs. To cover her family's needs, Geghanush is engaged in breeding livestock, including cows, pigs, piglets and hens, and in the cultivation of greens and alfalfa. Her son helps her sell the agricultural products in the local market. \r\n\r\nAs their needs are growing day by day, Geghanush needs to expand her agribusiness to be able to effectively meet her family's needs. She needs a loan of USD 1,500 to purchase wheat seeds, to buy fertilizers, to buy six pigs and to purchase some forage for the livestock. She has previously taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Geghanush was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Geghanush and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1459280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is 42 years old and mother to six children who are all studying. Her husband is unemployed although he sometimes makes small commissions on selling plots of land. The customer is a shareholder\/member of a stall (selling a variety of products). Her stall is set up in a lively place in her neighborhood. She began her business with the help of her family. Later on she benefited from a loan from IMF Hekima. She has been carrying out this activity for six years. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy a variety of products (two sacks of flour, two sacks of sugar, two sacks of Omo soap powder, one container of table oil, matches, two boxes of candy, two boxes of biscuits, one crate of Fanta, one carton of juice, one box of lotion, soap, etc.). \r\n\r\nShe would like to educate her children, expand her business projects and buy a plot of land. Selling on credit and foreign exhcange losses are the challenges for her business. Finally, she is extremely grateful to Hekima for making women who are not able to borrow from banks more autonomous, particularly during this critical period of war in the east of the country.

In her first job as an independent she walked around the market place carrying a portable food stall. Little by little the demand for her products increased and allowed her business to grow.

To assist her son in earning a living, Ruzanna is engaged in breeding a livestock of pigs and hens, and in the cultivation of peach, apricot, pears and grapes. The family realizes the agricultural products in the local market. They have a special refrigerator for fruits, where the fruits can remain fresh for a long time.  They keep the fruits in the refrigerator and sell them in winter, when the prices of those fruits are much higher. To continue the agribusiness in a sustainable way and develop it further, Ruzanna needs a loan of USD 2,500 to purchase a piece of land which she can use for horticulture.

That\u2019s why she has requested a KHR 4,000,000 loan that will enable her to buy materials needed to build a latrine and pay for labor costs. Having a latrine to use in the household, she can promote the family's health and keep her family from spreading pollutants into the surrounding environment. Thanks to lenders for making loans in a program like Kiva via its partners, HKL is able to help low-income people gain access to sanitation and personal hygiene. For this water loan product, HKL has provided Phorn a special interest rate and more suitable loan terms than its general products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1452503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy materials needed to build a latrine and pay for labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.5 104","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T11:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T11:40:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1014999.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479152190},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1014999.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561663020},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1014999.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649582307},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1014999.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681361281}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T06:01:12Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:15:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":625354,"name":"Kadijatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 46-year-old Kadijatu.
