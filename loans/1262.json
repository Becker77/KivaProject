Her husband is an elderly man in poor health, who cannot currently work.  One of her sons and a daughter, who is divorced, are working abroad.  Her youngest son is a student.  Khumor, just like most of her neighbors, raises livestock and grows vegetables.  Khumor's family is very large and it is becoming harder to provide for everyone.  To support her family, Khumor is planning to start a retail business.  She considers the sale of children's and women's clothing to be very profitable.  Using her savings, Khumor, had already bought a stall at the market.  \r\n\r\nIn order to purchase goods for resale, she has asked for a loan.  She wants to use the loan to purchase a collection of fall and winter clothing targeted to children and to women.  In this business, she will receive help from her student son.  They plan to travel to the city together to purchase the merchandise.  Khumor believes in the success of this business and thanks you for your support in

Julio does not have any children who can support him financially and he lives only with his wife, who helps him by working in the business too.  Julio works in the shop every day from 7am until 9pm.  He offers all types of staple goods and sells supplies and disposable goods to fast food restaurants.  So, with this work, Julio earns an income to cover daily costs.  Julio is strong, organised and hard working, and, despite his age, he still feels productive and useful.  Julio is currently applying for a loan to buy stock (dairy products, meat, disposable goods, eggs, bread, and more) in bulk.  This will help him to increase the variety of stock he offers, and to satisfy his customers' needs and wants, allowing him to be more competitive in the local market.  This will be reflected in an increase in his income, which he can use to continue supporting his family.  He can also continue toward his goal of expanding his shop and adding more products to the variety of stock he already offers.  More stock will result in more profitability for his personal finances and, with this, Julio wants to guarantee a better quality of life for his family and to enjoy his old age at his beloved wife's side in peace.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1462458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock (dairy products, meat, disposable goods, eggs, bread, and more) in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Itagui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87220},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89634},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92115},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94665},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97286},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99978},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102746},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105590},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108513},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111516},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114603},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117775},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121035},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124385},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127828},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131367},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135003},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138741}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":144.78,"local_amount":269364,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":272844.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010008},{"amount":50.67,"local_amount":94270,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":95487.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523628},{"amount":879.55,"local_amount":1636366,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1657507.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227325}],"funded_date":"2013-12-11T21:28:55Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":627352,"name":"Bernardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bernardo, con 56 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a trabajar como comerciante independiente desde hace aproximadamente 15 a\u00f1os, cuando se vio obligado a conseguir el sustento por cuenta propia cuando pasaba por una dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica; esto lo llev\u00f3 a montar una venta ambulante de papas fritas en diferentes presentaciones que vende a las afueras de una instituci\u00f3n educativa, pues vio en esta labor una buena fuente de ingresos; sus principales clientes son los estudiantes y las personas que transitan por el sector y, poco a poco ha logrado ser reconocido y, con los ingresos que recibe ha sacado adelante a su \u00fanico hijo, pues la responsabilidad recay\u00f3 totalmente sobre \u00e9l despu\u00e9s de la separaci\u00f3n con su esposa.

They work together so that there are no obstacles in the way of getting an excellent harvest, since her income comes from selling coffee. She sells what she produces to intermediaries who go to her community.  \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy fertilizer and 4,000 coffee plants to re-plant a part of her farm that isn't cultivated due to a lack of capital. Aida dreams of expanding her house in the future so her children can have a better quality of life. She had a lot of limitations in her childhood and she doesn't want them to go through the same thing. She also wants to offer them a college education so that they can have professions and a better future. She trusts that her children will help her financially in her old age. She thinks she will achieve these goals by improving her farm to obtain excellent harvests and therefore more income for her home that needs it so much.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1462763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and coffee plants to plant on her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T14:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T14:40:06Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.52,"local_amount":250.42,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":255.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082669},{"amount":1237.48,"local_amount":24749.58,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25244.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895345}],"funded_date":"2013-11-03T23:47:19Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":625427,"name":"Anitah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita is 29 years old, she has two children aged 2 and 6 years, She also takes care of her late brother's children.

She sews and tailors dresses using an old sewing machine, which has seen many years.  Makhfirat uses this machine because she does not have a newer one.  Now, she wishes to expand her business.

married.  Umutkan has a specialized-secondary education and works as a nurse at the regional hospital.  To generate supplemental income for her family, Umutkan raises livestock, which she started three years ago with the purchase of cattle for 3,000 KGS.  Thanks to Umutkan's hard work, she now has one milking cow and five sheep, in her household.  Her monthly income is 20,000 KGS.  With the goal of expanding her business, Umutkan turned to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase additional sheep.  Part of the profit from her business, Umutkan is planning to re-invest by purchasing additional livestock, and save the rest to pay for her son's wedding

Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near Tanzania. Inconsistent rains, especially recently, have made farming difficult, and the poverty rates in the county are above the Kenyan average. Beekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passion fruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies. Many farmers in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.\r\n\r\nMoses is married and has seven children. His wife is currently retired and engages in projects on their land.

She is married and has four children between the ages of 6 and 20. Three of her children are currently attending school. During the war, Fatmata established her business selling home products. She began her business because she wanted a source of income to support her household. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is that the purchasing power of customers is very low sometimes.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to buy cups, food containers, and plates for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her standard of living. In the future, Fatmata plans to open a big shop.

The family is large and they had little money.  As the eldest, Mar\u00eda had to help her mother and father in the home.  Later on, Mar\u00eda married and had two children.  However, her partner left her with their two children.  They are now in school - one is in fourth grade, the other in eighth. The school is near their community.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives with her two children and has to work alone.  She makes a living in agriculture, growing corn on 7000 square metres of land.  Mar\u00eda also raises cattle and farm animals, such as chickens.  In addition Mar\u00eda buys clothes and other items to sell from door-to-door.  She does all this work so as to support her children.\r\n\r\nIt was Mar\u00eda's father who taught her to work in farming, as she used to help him with his crops.  She also looked after her father's animals and the farm animals that he had at home. Mar\u00eda learned about selling clothes a few years ago as she had a very small monthly income.  This low income is due to the fact that the crops do not make any money until harvests Mar\u00eda's crops are located near her home and they must be looked after.  She also pays young labourers to work with the crops.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda must also look after the chickens all day as they need to be feed in order for them to develop well.  Mar\u00eda goes out to sell in nearby places and sells from door-to-door all day long if possible.  She sells clothes when she is not doing farming work.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 200 chickens, and the necessary feed for them to develop properly.  Mar\u00eda will also buy clothes to sell as Christmas is approaching and she will make more sales at this time.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mar\u00eda hopes to buy her own house as her children are growing up and she wants to give them their own house.  She also hopes to prosper with her children, and, if possible, wants them to go into tertiary education. Mar\u00eda hopes to buy more chickens next year, in order to increase the family's income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1462835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 200 chickens, and the necessary feed for them to develop properly.

She is a single mother of a young son whom she is still raising. She is from one of the municipalities of the Chinandega area which is distinguished by having one of the biggest sugar factories in the country. Commerce is also predominant and she started her business when she was very young, selling used clothes, shoes, shorts, dresses and more. She sells to order and has regular and occasional customers. She charges up front and sells on credit, collecting every two weeks or every week. She has her business in her house and at times goes out as a street vendor in different parts of her town. One of her dreams is to be able to see her son become a professional and for her business to prosper more, as well as improve her home and give her son a worthy place to live.

She has done farming since 2000, and she says it has rewarded her. She mainly grows tomatoes, which she takes and sells in the markets at a profit. She works five days per week and gives the business an average of five hours per day. \r\n\r\nIn addition to farming, she also makes and sells locally made cookies, which gives her more income. Her business is located in a rural area in Bushenyi District.

He completed through 7th grade. Afterwards, he was not able to continue because his work became more difficult. \r\n\r\nHe is married and his wife works on household chores.

He also worked for wages taking care of cattle. \r\n\r\nHe does agricultural work during the winter and plants his crops five kilometers from his house. When he goes to the territory, one of his sons takes him halfway, and then he had to walk because vehicles can't enter. He goes early in the morning and stays, if possible, all week, only taking what's necessary in food to stay all the time that is needed. His children help him sometimes with paying wages, but don't directly help with the crop.\r\n\r\nThe credit will be used to buy agricultural inputs: composts, fertilizers, workers' wages, and to prepare the land for the crop.

He decided to travel to the United States to work and obtain some assets. Afterwards, he returned to his country. His life partner works as a nurse and they have a ten-month-old daughter.\r\n\r\nNardino cultivates 14,000 square meters of corn. His father, who also works in agriculture, taught him this activity. He\u2019s done this since he was little because he studied at the same time as he worked with his father. Then, he worked in the cattle business. A friend, who he currently works with in the market, taught him this activity. He is also involved in raising and fattening chickens and in breeding cattle for grazing. When working in agriculture, he has to wake up early since his crops are 2 kilometers from his house.

He has gone through some hardships in his life. However, because of his dedication and desire to get ahead in life, he has been able to overcome these difficulties and make progress, together with his family. He owns a spice shop where he offers basic consumer goods for sale. He has been operating his business for two years. He started his business with a small grocery store, then he sold it to his brother and was able to establish a spice shop. Recently, his inventory of merchandise has diminished considerably. With the intention of increasing the quantity of products that he offers, he wants to buy more food products to display for his customers.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seed and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the

He sells his products to traders from Kyotera and those in the village.\r\nHis dream is to be the leading supplier of pineapple in the region, however he experiences a problem of price fluctuation of herbicides and lack of enough causal labor.\r\nHe describes himself as a hardworking and honest man and encourages lenders to continue helping farmers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1460349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pesticides and herbicides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-11-03T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-02T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":150217.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429636191},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":150217.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863629},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":150217.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752693},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":150217.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233673},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":150217.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468059130},{"amount":178.12,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":450652.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479276972}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T01:13:33Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T21:11:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":626296,"name":"Nurjamal","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041d\u0443\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043b 38 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043b -

It\u2019s often difficult for the family to cover feeding costs that is why Nino decided to purchase a milk cow and start a dairy business.

Tajikan has a higher education and works as a principal at a local school. To provide additional income for her family, Tajikan is involved in animal husbandry, having started 13 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS).

Indira has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Indira is involved in animal husbandry, having started 12 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Indira's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 10 sheep and 3.11 hectares of land, where she annually grows beans. The monthly income amounts to 5,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Indira requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy calves in order to increase livestock headcount. Indira plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's future education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1460986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves in order to increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Boo-Terek village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-03T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-02T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":54.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Indira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1037.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1037.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2020.14,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:36Z","rounded_local_amount":100664.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":54.86,"payment_id":542440275}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T20:42:54Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":626311,"name":"Sonunbubu","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u043e\u043d\u0443\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0431\u0443 67 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445  \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e. \u0423 \u0421\u043e\u043d\u0443\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0431\u0443 -

To deal with the financial difficulties, Islomhodja requested a loan.

Piensa que sus planes los lograran con el financiamiento que est\u00e1 solicitando, aprovechara al m\u00e1ximo esos recursos y los invertir\u00e1 en su finca que es la \u00fanica fuente de trabajo que genera ingresos en su hogar.\n\n\n","en":"Dilcia is a hard-working young woman, aged 32, who has a complete elementary education.  She is married and has three minor children, one of whom attends school. She lives with her threee children and her husband.\r\n\r\nFor five years Dilcia has been involved in agriculture, specifically coffee growing.  She learned the trade from her parents when she was a little girl, so she and her husband have much experience in the sector.  They bought the cropland they have through a lot of hard work and it is located one kilometer from their house, so it is an 8-minute walk to get to the plantation.  They begin their work by cleaning and fertilizing the fields.  Everyone in the family collaborates so as not to have to pay much to hire workers, which is very expensive.  Dilcia hopes to obtain an excellent harvest because her household economy depends on it.  She sells her crop to dealers in the area. \r\n\r\nShe is in need of a loan to buy fertilizer, plant treatment, and hire workers, and also buy 550 coffee plants to finish planting the rest of the plantation.\r\n\r\nIn the future, dilcia wants to expand her plantation to increase production and improve her income.  She wants to be able to give her children an education when they grow up so they will have better opportunities than she had.  She believes she can carry out her plans with the loan she is requesting.  She will take full advantage of the resources and invest them in the plantation which is her household's only source of income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1462934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He lives in Kisaayi and has a retail shop and does agriculture as a side income. He started his business in 2003.\r\n\r\nHe works 7 days a week and 18 hours per day and he started his business to increase his family income. He is acquiring this loan to purchase more stock for the retail business.

She has a five-acre farm where she does dairy farming and where she has four cows which produce 15 litres of milk per day. She plants maize, passion fruit, tomatoes and potatoes. Tomatoes and potatoes are grown for commercial use and she also has 20 poultry. She states that she enjoys farming very much but access to dairy feed is her biggest challenge.\r\n\r\nPriscilla chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because of the low interest it gives on their loans and the loan repayment has been made easier to clients. During Juhudi's micro-finance training session, Priscilla learned that in order to grow financially, she has to develop a savings culture. This loan will benefit her family by increasing the income base because by building cattle sheds the dairy cows will be well taken care of and thus produce more litres of milk.\r\n\r\nShe is looking

She is single and still lives in her parents' house. She isn't studying any more because her economic situation does not allow her to pursue a university degree. There are five persons living together with her: her parents who are merchants and three siblings, whereof two are studying and one is helping out with the family business.\r\n\r\nSantos owns a stall where she sells toys for boys and girls, which is located in the same place where her parents have their business. She has been running this business for two years since she left school. She has been looking for another job, but since she couldn't find one she decided to start working in commerce. Apart from managing her own business she also helps out with that of her parents, which is located three blocks from their home; she rides there on a bicycle. She works six hours a day. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy merchandise in order to increase the sales of her business. She will buy toys for boys and girls, among other things.

She and her husband ran the farm together before they split up.   \r\n\r\nThe farm was the only way for Mar\u00eda to support her family after her marriage ended, so she dedicated herself to managing it on her own. The farm is three kilometers from her home and she hires a car to take her there and carry supplies. Mar\u00eda usually spends five hours a day working at the farm. She also has a small business preparing and selling coconut candies that provides a small income to supplement the farm. Mar\u00eda travels around the canton three days a week selling the candy. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is applying for a loan to purchase pesticides and three bags of manure for her corn, bean, and sorghum crops. At this point in the season, these crops require fertilizer and pesticides. \r\n\r\nThe supplies that Mar\u00eda will purchase with this loan will boost her harvest significantly. She will be able to apply the fertilizer and pesticides at just the right time.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's goal is to be able to work a plot closer to her home, as the land she works now is too far away. She will also invest part of her income from the farm to invest in her coconut candy business. She also hopes one day to be able to sell staple grains in order to help support her family.

The loan will improve his life as he will have somewhere of his own to live which will improve the relationship with his family as they will be in their own place.\r\n\r\nHe dreams of seeing his family succeed through work that they can do as a family and of seeing his children study so that one day they can be professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1462987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"buy sun-dried bricks, roof tiles and wood to build his own home seeing as he currently lives with his extended family","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-03T13:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-02T13:50:18Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":85.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":86.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":103.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":107.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":111.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":115.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":124.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.14},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":197.67,"local_amount":197.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":197.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716461},{"amount":66.46,"local_amount":66.46,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":66.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622083},{"amount":157.83,"local_amount":157.83,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":157.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088318},{"amount":3.14,"local_amount":3.14,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902568},{"amount":112,"local_amount":112,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215792},{"amount":21.06,"local_amount":21.06,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":21.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817155},{"amount":117.65,"local_amount":117.65,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":117.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242639},{"amount":65.48,"local_amount":65.48,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":65.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525721},{"amount":458.71,"local_amount":458.71,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":458.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008232}],"funded_date":"2013-12-12T18:32:08Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:16:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ines Teles","image":11524}},{"id":625697,"name":"Didin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Didin runs a small stall selling phone accessories and mobile phone airtime credits and processing bill payments.

She is in her late 40s and is from Waterloo Eastern area in Freetown. She is married and has three children. \r\n\r\nShe began her business because she wants to be self dependent and educate her children. For the past 13 years, Isatu has run her general stock business.  She works at the business 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to purchase more items like cigarettes, biscuits, juice and pure water.

He purchases supplies from the central bazaar and sells them in the local market. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he is in need of purchasing more supplies from the central bazaar to continue his shop, but due to financial constraints, he finds it difficult.

She is friendly and works very hard to take care of her family. She lives at home with her mother, father and twin sister. She runs a Zoona mobile money transfer business in Chilanga, a town located 20 km away from the Zambian capital city of Lusaka.\r\n\r\nBefore running her own mobile money business, Esther worked as a cashier for a lending financial institution. She used her salary to take herself to school and obtained a certificate in Banking and Finance. Her experience helps her in the day-to-day running of her business. \r\n\r\nEsther says her community benefits from her business of mobile money transfers because they do not have to travel to the big city of Lusaka, as they used to in the past to access financial services. She is very pleased with the business because it allows her to have a minimum income at the end of the month to pay for rentals.\r\n\r\nEsther is pleased to be connected to the Kiva lenders and have the opportunity to access working capital support. She explains that even though she has been running her business for three years now, it has not experienced a lot of growth. This is due to the fact the she does not have enough money in her business to serve customers who want to send and receive larger amounts of money. Currently, Esther is operating with a very low amount of capital reserves. This is not enough because mobile money is becoming more popular and the demand for the product has increased.\r\n\r\nEsther is requesting a Kiva loan so that she can grow her business, by adding money to enable her to serve more customers.

She is married, and has 3 children aged 11, 7, 5 years; all are school children. She has 1 additional dependent, who lives with her and helps her in domestic work.  \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Abibatu established her Local Food Stuffs (pepper, palm oil, groundnut, cola nuts etc.) business. She began her business because her parents were divorced, she was brought up by her grandmother, and she took up responsibility at an early age. Her grandmother was a petty trader and could not afford to pay her school fees. Abibatu was hawking from one place to another with the business; there she learned a lot about surviving through hardship. \r\n\r\nWorking 5 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,686,000 every month from this business.

He lives with his parents. Sarmen's mother works in the private sector. To take care of his family, Sarmen is engaged in beekeeping. His father helps him in his everyday activities related to beekeeping. Sarmen sells the honey in the local market, which is an important source of income for the family. Honey is a product in very high demand, particularly if it comes from the family's area. \r\n\r\nTo continue beekeeping in a sustainable way, Sarmen needs to make some investments in it. He needs a loan of $3,000 to purchase twenty beehives and to pay for the renovation and transportation of the beehives. He has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to repay it. However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Sarmen has been able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nHe has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Sarmen and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1460513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

This city enjoys a chilly climate. It is flanked by four rivers that surround it; its uneven geography gives it beautiful landscapes. The historic downtown became a World Heritage site in December of 1999.  Like the members of the group, its people are women who daily find themselves in the fight to improve their economic stability in order to get their families ahead, while maintaining the culture and traditions of their people.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Se\u00f1ora Blanca, who is taking out her first loan alongside her friends and fellow group members from the Estrellita communal bank.

She is married and from her marriage has three children, ages 25, 20, and 15 years.  Her first child is studying in the university, and the younger two children study in a school in the city.

This canton is privileged to enjoy a temporate climate, and fertile lands where the most beautiful flowers and a grand variety of fruits are harvested. Its rugged geography gives rise to lovely landscapes.\r\n\r\nThe group members are kind, gentle people who enjoy very good health, and always keep their good humor and a smile on their face. They work daily to improve the economic stability of their homes to provide a better future for their children.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Fanny, who has been part of the group Rosas Rojas for three years. She likes this form of credit because it gives her the opportunity to establish stronger bonds of friendship with all of her group members while improving the conditions of her family. Fanny is 35 years old and is a single mother with a 6-year-old daughter who is studying in a school in the sector. She lives in her own house.

She is sacrificing her whole life for the sake of providing them with the best standard of living. Ibtissam works as a housekeeper.

She works hard to increase her income, in order to provide her children with the things they need and request.\r\n\r\nIbtissam is acquiring a portion of this loan, in order to start a new business of her own to improve her family's living. She will start selling clothes from her house. She will also work on visiting expected customers, to distribute her products easily.\r\n\r\nAs for the future, she hopes that one day she'll be capable of opening her own clothes-selling shop and able to quit providing cleaning services to strangers.

It is comprised of six members, three ladies and three men.\r\n\r\nJustine, one of the group's members, is a married woman, aged thirty years. She is the mother of two children, aged six and ten years, who both go to school. She does outside catering, as her main source of income. She trades firewood, as a supplementary business. In catering, she works six days a week, for only seven hours a day. Justine started the business in 2010, because she lacked formal employment.
