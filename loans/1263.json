He lives with his wife, daughter, two sons and daughter-in-law. To take care of his family\u2019s needs Davit is extensively engaged in agribusiness. He is involved in cattle breeding, in breeding a livestock of sheep, in aviculture (birds), in beekeeping and in cultivation of wheat. Davit\u2019s sons help him in selling the agricultural products in the local market. \r\n\r\nTo be able to run his agribusiness in a more efficient way, Davit needs a loan of $3000 USD to purchase agricultural machinery. With the help of the machinery it will be easier for him and for his family members to organize their agribusiness.

is a married man aged 45 years with 4 children all attending different schools in Rakai. He lives in rural area and he has a retail shop business and he also deals in cattle rearing as well as trading which he considers as his side income. He started the business in 1998.\r\n\r\nHe works 7 days in a week and 14 hours per day where he divides his time so that the two businesses run smoothly. He said that he started his business to improve on the standard of living of his family and to get tuition for his children.\r\n\r\nHe is acquiring this loan to add stock in his retail business to enable his customer\u2019s access all the items they want.

He's applied for a loan of 1,500,000 shillings to be able to buy fertilizers to put in the tea field so that the fertility of the soils can be boosted and lead to a better tea crop. In addition to tea farming, Charles has a butcher business which gives him additional income - income he uses to cater to the needs of the family. He works two days in the tea fields and attends to the butchery the rest of the week. \r\n\r\nCharles started the business in hopes of earning enough money to meet the needs of his family and is happy that the business has rewarded him. He has many hopes for his business, that it will grow and deliver large earnings.

Her children are between 4 to 22 years old. With the little money she received from her mother, she was able to establish her business, 8 years ago.  She runs a table, where she sells palm oil, vita, and pepper. She spends 9 hours on her business, and faces no other problems except fewer goods on her table. She is requesting a loan to purchase more palm oil, vita oil, and pepper for her business. Her plan is to one day move from a table business to a shop business.

is  a  lush  green area  filled with corn fields and thick forests.  The pleasant smell of pine perfumes the air.  This  is  the  setting  where  eight  women  united  to  form  a  Friendship  Bridge  Trust  Bank  called  \u201cFemenil\u201d  meaning  \u201cfemale\u201d. Most of the women are 29 years old, and each has a tremendous desire to excel in order to support their families and their community. They are eager  to  begin their third  loan cycle,  which will be funded by KIVA investors,  with  Friendship  Bridge.  The amount requested will be used in their businesses which range from animal husbandry, small stores for daily consumption, textile production, and the creation of beautiful, embroidered handmade items. \r\n\r\nPetronila is one of the younger members of the Trust Bank.  She is 19 years of age and has two children.  Because  of  the  scarcity  of  financial  resources,  she  was  unable  to  continue her  education past the third grade.  Like  the  other  members  of  her  Trust  Bank,  she  knows  that  education is a vital key to a successful future and looks forward to watching  her children attend  school  in  the future.  Petronila raises animals and also owns a small store for daily consumption items. She needs more items on the shelves of her store. She approached Friendship Bridge for a new loan of $615 which she will use to buy more sugar, rice, noodles, pasta, bread, oil, and water.  In addition, she will purchase feed for the eleven turkeys that she is raising. She is most grateful to be a member of the \u201cFemenil\u201d Trust Bank for the working capital that is as necessary for her success as a business woman.  \r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank meet once each month with a Loan Officer or \u201cFacilitadora\u201d from Friendship Bridge.  They   not   only  make  payments  on  their  loans  but  also  receive  valuable  trainings  on  subjects  like  women\u2019s and  children\u2019s health and  nutrition, family planning,  money  management and  savings,  women\u2019s  rights  and  self  esteem.  The ladies send many blessings to KIVA investors and gratitude for funding their loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1459769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

away, and it was very difficult for her to cope with her family expenses because she wasn't making enough money.  She is 44 years old and the breadwinner for two children.  She is a light in the lives of these children and is their only hope.  Kumriniso has a degree in teaching and has worked for more than 26 years in high schools.  She has made a large contribution to education in Tajikistan - Kumriniso has taught many students, and her students work in a variety of fields.

years old, married, and, together with her husband, is raising 6 children.  Makhbuba has a higher education.  Makhbuba's work in animal husbandry, beginning 13 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS, has been the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Makhbuba's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows, 1 horse, and 0.98 hectares of land, on which she grows corn and sunflowers every year.  Makhbuba's monthly income is 20,000 KGS.  With the goal of continuing to grow her herd, Makhbuba turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase cows to fatten and resell.  Makhbuba plans to use profit from the loan to continue to increase the number of domestic livestock in her care, and also plans to save money to repair her house.

Fayziniso works in livestock, and, with the help of her father-in-law, has been raising cattle to sell for 4 years.  Fayziniso's parents taught her how to care for and feed cows, and before getting married, Fayziniso worked with her parents in a barnyard.  Now, however, Fayziniso can work in livestock on her own.

Alina has a high school education.  Alina's work in animal husbandry and farming, beginning 8 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 20,000 KGS, has been the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Alina's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows, 1 horse, 20 sheep, and 1.6 hectares of land, on which she grows beans every year.  Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS.  With the goal of further increasing her herd, Alina turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase sheep.

widow, and, after the death of her husband, has raised 2 children and run a farm by herself.  Naychabubu has a high school education.  Naychabubu's work in animal husbandry and farming, beginning 31 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 8000 KGS, has been the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Naychabubu's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows and 2.43 hectares of land, on which she grows beans, cabbage, and clover every year.  Her monthly income is 9000 KGS.  With the goal of further developing her farm, Naychabubu turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 80,000 KGS to purchase cows for cattle breeding.  Naychabubu plans to use profit from the loan to continue to increase the number of domestic animals in her care, and also plans to save money to pay for her son's wedding

The members of this group will help each other because some will raise the piglets while others will fatten them so they are ready to sell to make high quality pork rolls. Ni Ketut, who is a member of this group, will care for the sow and use her portion of this loan to buy feed and renovate cages. She hopes this new method will work so she and the Jepun Sari group will get satisfactory results.

He was born in a humble family who always worked in the fields. Thanks to that, he now has a plantain farm that he harvests and sells in the regional market, which gives him income to support his family's basic needs. His drive, tenacity and perseverance have allowed him to overcome the difficulties he has faced, especially competition from others in this work.

She has a specialized-secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to Elmira's hard work, her farming business now comprises two dairy cows and ten sheep.

She has a specialized-secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business 18 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to Guljamila's hard work, her farming business now comprises two dairy cows, two heifers and fifteen sheep.  She also grows potatoes and beans annually on 3.72 hectares of land.

\n","en":"Ayshahar is 63 years old. She comes from a village located in the Qubadiyon region of Tajikistan.  Her family is involved in farming and sows agricultural crops.  In addition to farming, Ayshahar has decided to start her own business and would like to get involved in fattening and selling cattle.  She already has some experience in animal husbandry because her family owns a cow for their own need, and Ayshahar is the one taking care of that cow.\r\n\r\nAyshahar has an initial capital of $200.  However, she is taking a loan because this amount is not sufficient.  With her loan amount as well as her personal savings, she wants to buy three steers and some cattle feed.  She plans to feed her cattle for a period of 30 to 35 days and then resell them at the same cattle market where she bought them.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Ayshahar will be able to start and develop a new business, which will guarantee her a new source of income in her old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":990.93,"image":{"id":1461229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

She began to sell baby clothing, since there are very few baby clothes retailers in the province center and demand is high.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 3,700,000 MNT. She will use this amount to purchase baby clothes for her business. She expects to increase her income and to start saving for her children's university studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":1461080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Journalism and Mass Communication. Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the main goals in my life is to get a higher education, to become a highly qualified person. I am happy to enroll in AUCA this year. I had many reasons to enroll in AUCA, including the notable reasons of methodology, quality of the education, relationship of professors and resources that are available for the students. I had the honor to study at the New Generation Academy of AUCA. This is a unique program that started only this year for only 70 of the most intelligent students and I was lucky to be amongst those. During the year, we have been able to get great experience, skills and preparation for university entrance. While studying at the Academy, I developed even more desire to enroll in AUCA. Unlike all other universities, AUCA is considered to be one of the leading universities in our country and even in all Central Asia.\r\n \r\nSince I was in school, I did well in those assignments that consisted of interpretation, presentation, constructing reports and stories; and researching some interesting items. I think those things have been very useful for my future career. I think that I became a person who can make people interested in my information and change the way they think about certain subjects. I consider myself to be a good candidate for the Journalism and Mass Communication department. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I would like to mention is that AUCA gives many opportunities to all its students. The loan opportunity is among those opportunities. I would like to take this opportunity to apply for a Kiva loan, which is a great chance to be able to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1461109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She resides and does business in the trading centre which is outside Kampala city, neighbouring Kasubi tombs, where she runs an internet caf\u00e9 and small salon for ladies in the same building. This has enabled her to get income to look after her children by providing school fees and other necessities.\n\nAlice, who says her caf\u00e9 and salon businesses are doing fairly well in terms of sales, goes on to say that she is the only person with an internet caf\u00e9 business in the whole trading centre.

Born fourth in a family of six, her mother and father are not employed. Florence operates a Zoona mobile money transfer outlet at one of the largest hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia, to earn income and take care of her family.  \r\n\r\nFlorence has been operating her business for 18 months now. This is her second Kiva loan. Her first loan came in April of 2012, right when she was starting her business. The loan was used for her to add to her working capital and have the ability to serve more customers. She also used some of the loan to purchase a directional sign, a few kilometers away from her outlet location, to draw customers to her shop. She says this helped her business receive new customers.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Florence is seeking a second loan so she can open an additional outlet nearby in Lusaka. The money will be used as start-up working capital to serve customers and help the business grow. She will also hire a new employee to assist with running the new outlet.  \r\n\r\nFlorence is hopeful that opening a second shop will double her current profits. She explains how the cost of running a business in the capital city of Lusaka is very expensive. A lot of her revenue goes to paying rent for her shop space at the hospital. Florence is looking to continue to expand her business so she can earn more income and provide better for her family.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1460722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To open her second Zoona mobile money transfer shop in Lusaka, so that she can serve customers in need of financial services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":59.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":37,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":209.13,"local_amount":1152.19,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1179.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.79,"payment_id":531340958},{"amount":423.3,"local_amount":2389.85,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T11:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2447.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.77,"payment_id":562560124},{"amount":225.78,"local_amount":1270.68,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.65,"payment_id":579833152},{"amount":32.13,"local_amount":187.28,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":191.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.45,"payment_id":595362711}],"funded_date":"2013-11-10T16:20:42Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T16:43:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":626416,"name":"Rawaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rawaa is 23 years old.

After several unsuccessful attempts, Besik applied for credit from Credo. His request was approved under the framework of Credo's start up loan program, which is joint initiative with Kiva. A loan of $2,000 will help the family to purchase raw materials and start making Georgian Khachapuri (cheese pie). Elene has experience in this field and she will get orders for making Khachapuri. Besik is very enthusiastic and a hard working person with a great desire to progress in life with his mother.

She describes herself as friendly and hardworking.\r\n\r\nPetronella provides the service of mobile money transfers in her hometown of Chingola. She says the business gives people the opportunity to access financial services at very affordable rates. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge she faces in the business involves working capital. She does not have enough money to serve all her customers and so she can only serve a limited number of customers in a given day. This means the business loses out on potential profits. It is for this reason that she has requested a Kiva loan. The loan will go towards serving her customers by providing working capital.\r\n\r\nPetronella has high hopes for the future; she is hopeful that accessing this loan will be the start of significant growth in the business. The anticipated growth will also help her in her personal life. She explains that in her household, it is only herself and her father who have a source of income. Her father is a miner and earns a small amount of money. This puts pressure on Petronella to do well in her work and grow revenues.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1460887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To allow the mobile money business to serve more customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chingola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":88.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petronella ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":151.67,"local_amount":808.88,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":817.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449781133},{"amount":167.62,"local_amount":909.13,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":918.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.84,"payment_id":459261922},{"amount":158.54,"local_amount":875.62,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-19T09:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":884.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.64,"payment_id":468086456},{"amount":168.74,"local_amount":998.77,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T22:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.53,"payment_id":479303840},{"amount":194.41,"local_amount":1094.79,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T21:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1106.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.86,"payment_id":491000296},{"amount":162.99,"local_amount":898.72,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":908.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.52,"payment_id":504442356},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":949.91,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.68,"payment_id":517719059},{"amount":234.34,"local_amount":1308.38,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1322.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.98,"payment_id":531340959},{"amount":376.82,"local_amount":2155.8,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T11:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2178.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.39,"payment_id":562560125}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T08:57:54Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T11:29:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":626431,"name":"Tigranuhi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tigranuhi is 34 years old and she lives in Vanadzor city.

He is a father to his children. By the grace of God, Nestor has managed to support his children's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to continually send his children to school to finish their studies.\r\n\r\nNestor oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have a jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, and is paying a boundary (daily quota) each day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 40,000 PHP [Philippines pesos] loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new tires for the jeepney and renew his registration.\r\n\r\nNestor dreams that his business will continue to grow and hopes that his children will finish their education. He meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week.\r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1461192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

She is married and has four children. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Aminata established her hair attachment and cosmetics business. She began her business because, when the war broke out, she relocated to Freetown with her family.  She was struggling to provide food for her family. She decided to start petty-trading with the help of a distant relative.  \r\n\r\nAfter the rebel war, she returned to Makeni and continued with her trading.  Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about SLL 775,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nAminata would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000.

She is married and mother of three children. Two of  the children live with them. One is studying in primary school and the other is an adolescent who helps with the household work. Maria did not complete her primary school studies as much as her parents tried. Her family had very modest economic resources.\r\n\r\nFor the past 7 years Maria has worked alongside her husband farming, in particular growing coffee. She learned this activity as a child who accompanied her parents at work (harvesting coffee) on other people's plantations in order to survive. \r\n\r\nShe worked very hard to obtain her plantation. This is her motivation and she wants to see her land under cultivation. It is located 4 kilometers from her house and every morning her and her husband walk the 25 minutes it takes to get to the plantation.

He is employed in the private sector, however, his salary alone is not enough to meet the needs of his family. \r\n\r\nArtyom is engaged in cattle breeding, in breeding livestock (sheep and pigs), in agriculture, and in the cultivation of wheat. He sells the agricultural products in the local market. Agribusiness is the most important source of the family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nTo be able to more effectively meet the growing needs of his family, Artyom needs a loan of USD $3,000 to purchase two cows, a calf, some forage for cattle, and to make previous credit repayments. \r\n\r\nHe had already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to his recent hard work, Artyom was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history, and have no access to credit products. \r\n\r\nArtyom and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to sustain their agribusiness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1461311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She does her business of selling fast food from Thursday to Sunday from 6 pm to 1 am while sewing dresses the other part of the time and according to the orders of her clientele. \r\nIn the month of December, the food products sold by Beatriz are in high demand. For the season, she prepares an increased production to sell more and increase her profits. \r\nIn her fast food business she has seen sales increase from less to more. She remembers that, some time ago, she made all of her products in a fledgling way and without a cart for preparation and display. Now she has a facility that allows her to be more comfortable in her work and display what she has for sale, boosting her sales in the market. Her best customers are the residents of the neighborhood and passersby who pay in cash. When she is shopping, Beatriz always buys from wholesalers that offer the best prices so she can be more competitive in the market. Her goal is to grow this business and, therefore, she has sought a Kiva loan as her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will buy sausages, flour, sugar, sauces, and additives, awaiting the approaching New Year's holidays when students are her best customers. With the investment of this loan, Beatriz plans to be open for business Monday to Sunday to increase sales and make her Kiva loan the best investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1463551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy sausages, flour, sugar, sauces, and additives.

productos,  y su madre le impuls\u00f3 esa idea de negocio,  pues a ella le gust\u00f3 mucho. Sus principales productos, son las hayacas, deditos, empanadas y quibbes, los cuales ofrece de manera directa, sin intermediarios,  a cr\u00e9dito y de contado. \nDe lunes a s\u00e1bados, Maria se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n de su materia prima, mediante la mezcla, amasado,  moldeado y e cocci\u00f3n, agregando a cada uno de los productos, los insumos requeridos, como queso, carne, verduras etc. lo cual da como resultados deliciosos pasabocas de consumo inmediato y listos para la venta.  Su d\u00eda laboral inicia a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana y termina a las 6 de la tarde, y sus compras las realiza en las centrales de abastos del municipio.

She sells products made from  wheat flour such as deditos (a local pastry) and empanadas. She has two years experience doing this. A friend of hers showed her how to make these products. Her mother gave her the idea of doing it as a business as Maria enjoyed making them. \r\n\r\nHer main products are hayacas, qibbes, deditos and empanadas (all traditional meat filled pastries) which she offers directly to the public, not through middlemen, in cash and on credit. From Monday through Saturday she prepares the raw materials, measures them, kneads them, molds them and cooks them, adding the products and ingredients necessary for each one, such as cheese, meat and vegetables, etc.  The result is delicious snack ready to sell and eat. She starts her work day at 8 am and finishes at 6 pm. She buys the products from warehouses in the municipality. Her principal clients live in the area where she lives and has her business. Her goal is to be recognized by everyone in her marketing area. \r\n\r\nAt present she does all the work manually and this requires more energy all the time. This makes her tired. In her effort to grow and respond to her client's demand Maria is requesting a loan from Kiva. It will be her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use it to buy a dough rolling machine. This will reduce her production times as she won't have to knead by hand and also it will increase her production capacity. This makes it a successful investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1463548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a dough rolling machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83231},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89728},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":92420},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":95192},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":98048},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100990},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":104019},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":107140},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":110354},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":118878}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.78,"local_amount":83231,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-28T09:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":86626.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062523},{"amount":49.35,"local_amount":89728,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":93388.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732237},{"amount":50.83,"local_amount":92420,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-23T09:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":96190.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415452},{"amount":52.56,"local_amount":95557,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":99455.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104589},{"amount":53.89,"local_amount":97983,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":101980.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919491},{"amount":55.71,"local_amount":101294,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":105426.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140294},{"amount":56.88,"local_amount":103415,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":107634.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834180},{"amount":58.92,"local_amount":107140,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":111511.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504260309},{"amount":60.7,"local_amount":110354,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":114856.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542581},{"amount":65.38,"local_amount":118878,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":123728.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530025848}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T14:54:43Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T12:13:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":626587,"name":"Mane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mane is a young and prosperous teacher, 38 years old, and she lives in Vanadzor city, which is in Lori region. \r\n\r\nMane is married and she has two lovely, school-aged children.

With the aim of further developing her farm, Mukhtarkan turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 Som in order to buy bull-calves with the aim of feeding them up and selling them on.

Their salaries, however, are so low that they cannot afford a living based on those salaries. To be able to cover their daily needs, Armenuhi and her family are engaged in breeding cows, pigs, piglets, and hens, and in the cultivation of wheat, potatoes, apples and pears. They realize the agricultural products in the local market. To continue running her agribusiness and to sustain it, Armenuhi needs a loan of USD 2,500 to purchase barley seeds, to buy some fertilizers, to purchase some forage (grass and barley) for the livestock, and to make previous credit repayments. Armenuhi and her family rely on the good will of the lenders and will be very grateful to them for their support.

He will use the anticipated increase in income to educate his children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1461348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy another motorbike.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mombasa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-4.05 39.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":203,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adhengi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":21100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":959},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":961}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":11.36,"local_amount":959,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":970.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429557140},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":2877,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2910.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439780868},{"amount":69.79,"local_amount":5890.64,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-08T10:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5959.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449679438},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":3937.64,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3983.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459149428},{"amount":53.99,"local_amount":4556.72,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4609.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467965180},{"amount":34.12,"local_amount":2879,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2912.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479186263}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T13:04:55Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T13:16:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":626615,"name":"Murad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Murad is 51 years old and he lives in the village Ddmashen, which is in the Gegharkunik region.

After the death of her husband she raises six children by herself, and also manages her own business. Patila has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Patila works with livestock breeding, after having started 20 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Patila's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow and ten sheep. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Patila turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep to increase the number of livestock. Patila plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals.

Topchugul has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Topchugul works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 23 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Topchugul's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow and also a plot of land of 1.0 hectares. Here she grows sweet corn every year. The monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Topchugul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of heifers to fatten and breed. Topchugul plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals.

Roza has secondary education. As a main income for her family, Roza works with livestock breeding, after having started 11 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 50,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Roza's persistent work, her farm currently has five dairy cows, two calves, five sheep and three goats. The monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Roza turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of a cow and a horse to increase the number of livestock. Roza plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals.

","en":"Nigora is a young and very hard-working woman, 28 years of age. She is a successful entrepreneur. \r\nShe has 10 year of experience in retail and has been able to improve her outcomes during this time. She sells groceries. Nigora is married and has one child. She lives with her family in the J. Rasulov region. Her sales point is at the central market, in a busy location. Her husband works at private construction sites, and in his free time helps his wife. This summer Nigora has completed some minor remodeling of her summer kitchen; in order to do  this, she had to spend money taken out of her working capital. Her sales volume decreased, which is why she turned to Arvand for financial support. She would like to use her credit to stock up on groceries and increase her sales volume. Nigora thanks Arvand in advance for its help and support. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1460255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.
