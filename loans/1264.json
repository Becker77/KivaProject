","en":"This aspiring businessman's name is Kholmat.  He is 34 years old, married, and lives with his wife and children in the Shahrituz region of Tajikistan.  His wife busies herself with sewing at home, while Kholmat works as a home repair contractor.  As winter draws near, Kholmat has been getting fewer and fewer clients, and has been earning less as a result, which is why he's decided he'd like to start up his own cattle-selling business.  He already has a cow barn at his house, and also has 200 bundles of hay on hand made from corn stalks.  \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy a couple of young bulls for his business.  He plans on fattening the bulls for around 30-35 days, then selling them at a local market.  With the help of this loan, Kholmat will have the makings of a profitable

ocupados en sus negocios. Porque ellos no quer\u00edan tener un nombre com\u00fan y como el nombre de flores o plantas son muy repetitivas decidieron buscar  un nombre de frutas y se les ocurri\u00f3 mangos. Do\u00f1a Amanda tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Rub\u00e9n desde hace 30 a\u00f1os juntos han formado una familia con cuatro hijos  que ya no dependen de dicha pareja, Do\u00f1a Amanda se dedica a la cr\u00eda y engorda de cerdos para su venta desde hace ya 15 a\u00f1os tiene una muy buena estructura para tener muchos cerdos hasta el momento tiene 40 cerdos muy bien nutridos.

El sue\u00f1o de Do\u00f1a Amanda es poder llegar a tener mas saudas para tener m\u00e1s cerdos siempre le ha gustado tener animales y no quisiera dejar de criar porque de alguna manera con sus ganancias ayuda a su esposo  con los gastos del hogar.

It is a community with a lot of trees.  Its inhabitants are very happy people who are hard-working, and, above all, they are entrepreneurs who almost never have time for other activities.  This is because they are always busy with their businesses.  \r\n\r\nThey did not want to have a common name, and because flower or plant names are very repetitive, they decided to look for a fruit name, and mangos occurred to them.\r\n\r\nAmanda, age 52, has been married to Rub\u00e9n for 30 years.  Together they have formed a family with four children, who are no longer dependent upon the couple.  Amanda has been raising and fattening pigs to sell for 15 years.  She has a very good structure for having a lot of pigs.  To date she has 40 very well-fed pigs.\r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan from VisionFund and Kiva to buy feed for her pigs that she has at her house.  Amanda never buys pigs from other people.  Her own pigs give birth to little pigs, and those are the ones she raises and fattens to later sell to a fixed buyer.  The buyer makes carnitas every day.  She also sells to another customer in the municipality, and her sale is assured.\r\n\r\nAmanda states, \u201cI don\u2019t have any difficulty because I have had the experience of raising these animals ever since I was little.  It is a business activity that I inherited from my parents\u201d.  Amanda\u2019s dream is to be able to have a more money in order to have more pigs.  She has always liked having animals, and she would not like not raising them.  This is because, with her income, she helps her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAmanda is grateful for her loan.  The rest of the group is also grateful to invest in their businesses.  Lucia and Placida will buy tortillas, Nayeli and Brigida will buy feed for their pigs, Jos\u00e9 Juan will buy chickens, and Martha will buy flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":1463068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has five children between 11 and 30 years old; only two are in school and live at home. With a  little money from her mother, she was able to establish her business in 2009. She has been running a small local shop where she sells onions, oil, salt, etc in the local market. She spends 9 hours each day on her business, from Monday to Saturday. A problem she faces is inadequate income; she is requesting a loan to purchase more onions, oil, salt, etc. for her business.

It was her parents who taught her to work on the land at a young age given that growing coffee is a family tradition. With her partner she has been carrying out this activity for four years, each of them supporting the other in order to strengthen their home, economic situation and the well-being and future of their child. \r\n\r\nThe land was inherited to her by her parents which is located 500 meters from their home, which is very close from them to travel on foot each day to provide up-keep and maintenance. One of her and her spouse's greatest priorities is to keep their crops free of pests like the leaf rust and borers that destroy her entire harvest, resulting in a loss of time and money invested. \r\n\r\nHer dreams are to be able to put up a dignified roof someday, and to continue strengthening her land through the purchase and planting of coffee. She hopes that as her son gets older, he studies, has a brighter future, and greater preparation than that which her and her spouse have had. For this reason she is requesting this financing to be able to buy the agricultural supplies to continue to attend to her crops and give the best maintenance possible in order to have an excellent harvest.

El nombre del grupo lo eligieron ellas mismas porque viven muy cerca de un r\u00edo peque\u00f1o. Las personas de esa comunidad utilizan esta agua para usos m\u00faltiples. Elodia es una mujer muy joven pero sobretodo muy alegre tiene 24 a\u00f1os sin embrago a su corta edad tiene un gran esp\u00edritu emprendedor, vive en uni\u00f3n libre desde hace seis a\u00f1os con Jaime quien trabaja en la construcci\u00f3n de casas, juntos han formado una familia con dos ni\u00f1os su ni\u00f1o m\u00e1s grande tiene cinco a\u00f1os aun no asiste a la escuela y su bebe.

They belong to the same community, which is very beautiful and interesting because it has various festivals all year, and above all because they preserve their culture like their native language and very colorful dress. They chose the name of the group themselves because of the small river that they live close to. The people in the community use its water for many things. \r\n\r\nElodia is a 24-year-old young woman who is very happy and despite her young age has a great, enterprising spirit.  She has been in a free union with her husband Jaime (who works in construction) for 6 years.  Together, they have a family with 2 children.  Their youngest child is their 5-year-old who hasn't started school yet.  They also have an infant.\r\n\r\nElodia has worked raising chickens and turkeys for 5 years.  She learned how to raise them from chicks until they become adults thanks to her mother.  When she decided to start her own family, she decided to find some way to help her husband with the household expenses and started raising chickens on her own.  She isn't able to leave the house to work because her children are young and there is no one else to take care of them.\r\n\r\nElodia is very grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund for the loan because it will allow her to buy her small turkeys and chickens.  She will take care of them in her house for 8 months and then either sell them or use them to feed her family to save on food expenses.  The only problem that Eloida has is when her animals get sick and die.  She thinks that it is often because it is very cold and she doesn't have a coop for them.  This challenge doesn't discourage her, however, because these things happen.\r\n\r\nElodia's only goal is to be able to have more chickens and turkeys, since they sell very well during holidays in her community.  Elodia mentioned that \"I am fortunate to have my own house but I would like to improve it so as to have access to all basic utilities and live better.\"  In addition, one of Elodia's dreams is to pay for the education of her children and allow them to study to have professional jobs.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group and very happy and grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva because they will be able to invest in their businesses.

This year Samnang is experiencing financial difficulties in sending her oldest child to join a university in Phnom Penh. Her son, Than, aged 18, is planning to enter the faculty of science at Royal University of Phnom Penh, the oldest and largest University in Cambodia. His dream is to be a mathematics lecturer at the university, but his first step is to be a high school teacher and then further his education to achieve his goal.\r\n\r\nSamnanag, with the loan amount requested, will pay for her son\u2019s tuition.

She is the mother of three children in different grades at a primary school in the community. Ruth did not complete primary school; she was able to go to school until the fourth grade. She is nevertheless grateful for the effort her parents made as they are people of few resources. \r\n\r\nHer parents-in-law are also living with her, and they help out and contribute by watching their grandchildren while she and her partner are out tending to the coffee plants to give them the necessary care as much as possible. She and her partner own the field they cultivate, thanks to the effort they made to be able to buy a piece of land from her partner's parents, with which they are able to generate an income to sustain the family. The land is located near the house they live in, and they get there by walking a distance of 1.5 kilometers. \r\n\r\nShe has currently requested a loan through the COMIXMUL cooperative to buy compost, coffee formula fertilizer, fertilizers, liquid fertilizer, and other items to help and protect her coffee crop.

He left his town of birth and headed for the city because of violence.  With his wife and children, he came to the city in search of new opportunities and to start from scratch. Samir left behind his home and business.  Here in the city it was difficult to find work and so Samir approached short-term loan sharks in order to buy fruits and vegetables, which he would then sell as a street vendor.  This is how he started his own business and now he also works as a temporary labourer in the construction industry, in order to supplement his income.  He goes between both jobs and is able to earn enough money to cover household costs.  Samir's drive, perseverance and optimism have allowed him to achieve his goals and he now wants to strengthen his business with the help of this loan:  with it, he will do up his new cart, buy a big parasol, buy stock (in-season fruits and vegetables) in bulk, and pay off a loan.  This will allow Samir to increase his assets and will improve his ability to sell a higher quantity of products.  The new cart is to give to one of his children, who will use it to work and bring in an income to support the household economy.  This loan will allow Samir to pay off his other loan, which has very high interest rates and is affecting his financial situation.  Samir wants to keep fighting and achieve his dream of having his own house.  With a house, he can have his own premises for his business, making it profitable and guaranteeing a good financial situation for his family.  Samir will then be able to enjoy a higher quality of life alongside his loved ones.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1463579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to do up his new cart, to buy a big parasol, to buy stock (in-season fruits and vegetables) in bulk, and to pay off a loan.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T23:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T23:00:10Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samir Gregorio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":56693},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":58262},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":59875},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":61532},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":63235},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64986},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66784},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":68633}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.95,"local_amount":58092,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":60462.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074814},{"amount":31.39,"local_amount":57075,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":59403.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010013},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":121195,"processed_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":126139.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523634},{"amount":145,"local_amount":263638,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":274394.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227330}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T18:26:57Z","paid_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":628158,"name":"Telma Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Telma es una mujer joven de 28 a\u00f1os de edad emprendedora, luchadora con muchas ganas de salir adelante que junto a su esposo se dedican a la agricultura con el cual procreo 3 hijos los cuales viven en casa y estudian en la escuela de la comunidad.

Sabletkan has higher education. As a main source of income for her family, Sabletkan works with livestock breeding, after having started 10 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Sabletkan's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows, one heifer, 10 sheep and 10 goats.

He is married and has two children. For the last five years, Shuhrat has worked hard in order to manage his store where he sells head wear. Striving to expand his business, Shuhrat applied for a loan from Arvand. \r\n\r\nShuhrat will use the current to purchase a car, so that it will be easier for him to transport his goods. Up until now he has transported goods by shuttle bus and it has been very hard for him. Shuhrat hopes that receiving a loan and purchasing a car will ease his work.

is 53 years old, married and resident of Dullan, Aloran, Misamis Occidental, Mindanao in the Philippines. From her desire to help the family, she engaged in a buying and selling business with PHP 3,000 for starting capital and she was able to expand it with the help of Paglaum Cooperative. Aside from financial assistance, she was able to generate savings and enjoys the benefit given by the co-op. She became a member in good standing and has taken out several loans. \n\nNow she is applying for 49,900 PHP to restock inventories for her business. She wants to buy bags of rice, cases of soft drinks, soap, noodles and others. Through this, she hopes to increase her income and from it she can then sustain the needs of her family. In the future, she one day wants to own a space near a public market where she could display her stocks with convenience. She will be fully satisfied if she sees her children finish their studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1454024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She was able to buy more stocks of used but quality clothes for her business, which has been running for seven years now. Her loan was also helpful in the education of her children. Her income from business assisted in their everyday household expenditures. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\n\nShe would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan to buy additional stocks of used but quality shirts, shorts, blouses, and pants. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \n\nSaipa hopes that her business will be stronger and have another branch.

More items to sell will result in better profit, which will definitely help her to sustain her children\u2019s education and daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nGloria hopes that her business will continue to flourish and dreams of having a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is in excellent health and brings a lot of energy and enthusiasm to her work. She is a mother to four children, who study in different year groups at the school in the community where she and her husband live. Her only support is her husband, who does the hardest and longest work of the day such as the cleaning, application of compost and foliar products, the washing and drying of the bean and others while she helps with picking the beans. \r\n\r\nIt was thanks to her husband that she learned to work the land, because his family are farmers, with whom she has exercised this activity for three years. Her customers are the different buyers and intermediaries who visit the area looking for the product to resell it on the local and international markets. One of the biggest problems with this business is the variation in prices in the inputs that are applied to coffee, as competition isn't a problem for her and her husband. Her crops are located 200 metres from her home, which they get to walking as a family, which allows them to better care for her crops and the problems they might have. \r\n\r\nYensi Mabel is requesting a loan to buy 1800 small coffee plants to grow, 8 sacks of compost, 2 litres of foliar products, 8 litres of boron for her coffee crops so that she can sell them in the market for a very good price. Her goals are to have a healthy crop, free from plagues of harmful insects and others that can damage many hours and days work, and lead to the harvest being lost. As a mother, she also wants to see her children become people of worth, with university degrees which can help them to generate sources of income and improve every day.

They live in a place called \u2018El Oro\u2019 [The Gold] because gold was previously taken from the mines.  The place is also well-known for a railroad car, which now functions as a restaurant.  One of the members of the group said, \u201cThis railroad car was only a little part of the train that was left here.  However, it now functions as a restaurant that is well-known by the people.  The delicious cafes are the best of the place\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe El Oro municipality is known as \u2018Pueblo M\u00e1gico\u2019 [Magic Town], a name given to different colonial cities in the country.  J. Carmen, or Carmelo, as he is better known, is a member of the Artesanos del Oro group.  He is 52 years old, and he has been married to Rosaura for several years.  Together they have formed a family with eight children.  Three of the children are still dependent upon them and are in school.\r\n\r\nCarmelo has had a small carpentry business for seven years.  This time he is requesting a loan to buy wood, particle board, Resistol glue, and nails, etc. in order to make furniture like wardrobes, kitchen cabinets, tables, and chairs.  He says that he started his business activity because it was one of the trades he learned when he was young.  \u201cThanks to the loan, I have been able to maintain my carpentry business.  Without the loans from VisionFund and Kiva, I would not have been able to continue with my business activity.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis biggest difficulty is the lack of employment in the municipality where he lives and the little work obtained.  Carmelo\u2019s work is only by order.  If they come to request a piece of furniture from him, he makes it.  He is also considering setting out for other places in order to get more customers.  His earnings help him a lot.  This way he is able to pay his children\u2019s educational expenses.  He wants to continue helping with his children\u2019s educational expenses so that they are able to graduate from college.\r\n\r\nThat is why Carmelo needs his loan, and the members of the group also need their loan to invest in their business activities.  Antonio will buy medication and food for his veterinary business, Abigail will invest in her brass handicrafts, Ang\u00e9lica will buy feed for pigs, and Magali will buy \u2018ocoxal\u2019 [leaf used for handicrafts].\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1462926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood and particle board.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"J.

Since 2005, Nafees has been running his own embroidery store near his house, which is a very successful business for his family.

They have known each other for a number of years and during this time they have built up a close and sincere friendship. They live in a Mazahua community where some people still communicate in their native language. Nowadays very few women still wear the typical local dress which is characterized by very bright colors. Something very characteristic of the community where the group is based is its very green pasture land and the beautiful scenery of wooded hills. \r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica (also called Vero) is a member of the \"Barrio La Ca\u00f1ada\u201d group. She is 32 years old, has been married to Esequiel for five years. He works as a civil engineer. Together they have formed a family with two children who attend preschool. Vero has had a grocery store for the past year, which still does not have a name. She says that she wanted to have a grocery store like her father: \"When I lived with my father I liked to tend to the store because it everything was sold there and I had a lot of contact with people.\" She says that she started with very little merchandise, only perishable products like eggs, oils, sardines, tuna, canned beans, detergents, etc. \r\n\r\nShe did not have shelves or a refrigerator either, and this did not allow her to sell products like ham, cheese, sausages, etc. But, with her savings, with the profits obtained from the sale of her products, she has been able to grow her grocery store. Now she has more merchandise, shelves for her products, and also a refrigerator. Now she does sell all of the products and also can sell cold refreshments which people requested a lot. This time Vero is requesting a loan to buy more merchandise like bread, eggs, milk, sugar, soft drinks, etc. \r\n\r\nHer only difficulty is the competition in the same community. However, Vero is not worried because she will continue working very hard in order to have a store just like her father's store. Her father's store has all of the products that Vero is lacking, various things like brooms, mops, dish towels, etc. She says, \"This is one of my biggest goals, to have more merchandise, to be able to improve our quality of life, and also to pay for the education costs of our children without worries.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are thankful because they will use the loan in their economic activities, which will perhaps help them to improve their profits and expand their business. Irma, Adriana, Marcelina, and Mar\u00eda Elsa will invest in their grocery stores, Rosario and Mar\u00eda Juana will invest in their sheep, and Ma Rosario will invest in the sale of clothing. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4225,"image":{"id":1460821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, bread, eggs, soft drinks, canned goods etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Jeronimo de los Dolores, San Felipe del Progre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6875},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":528.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1056.25,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":13751.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644493},{"amount":1584.37,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20627.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877954},{"amount":1056.26,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":13751.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766984},{"amount":528.12,"local_amount":6875,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6875.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247786}],"funded_date":"2013-11-05T23:20:03Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":628172,"name":"Melba","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Por Un Nuevo Amanecer se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

She is married to Efren, a vendor, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her child will finish his studies.

","en":"Ashurhon is 38 years old.  She is a hardworking and goal-oriented woman.  Five years ago, she and her sisters opened a beauty salon in the center of their district.  Two years ago, she brought in wedding dresses and started to rent them out.\r\n\r\nAshurhon's husband is a migrant worker who currently lives in Russia.  Ashurhon visited him two months ago and brought back some wedding dresses to renew her inventory.\r\n\r\nAshurhon now needs to organize her daughter's wedding, but she doesn't have enough money to do so.  Traditionally, wedding ceremonies are very costly events in Tajikistan, and this is why Ashurhon needs money.  She is taking a loan of 6,000 somoni to pay for her daughter's wedding ceremony.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nMarlene operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. \r\n\r\nMarlene dreams that her business will flourish and hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Bunusa has a higher education. To provide the primary income for her family, Bunusa is involved in animal husbandry, having started 10 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bunusa's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and also a 0.74 hectare land plot, where she annually grows corn and wheat. The monthly income amounts to 17,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Bunusa requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows for fattening up and subsequent resale. Bunusa plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to repair a barn.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1461937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Tahmina is a modern woman, who was born in 1981. She is married and is raising three children. As a child Tahmina was taught by a dressmaker how to make women's clothes. Tahmina is now an experienced dressmaker. She has been working as a seamstress for over 7 years. She works from home and tries to create good living conditions for her children. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.

She and her colleagues organize several fairs either in their own city or in other cantons so they can display and sell their products.  Straw hats are the most widely sold items since they are very popular among foreigners who visit the area.  She has been running her shop for two years.

He has more than 10 years experience doing this work. At times he buys wood lots to cut down the trees and then sell the lumber. At other times, when he doesn't have capital available he just gets paid for the labor. In addition, and to supplement his income, he grows coffee. He collects the harvest and sells it in the plaza of the regional market. In this way he has enough resources to pay for his household expenses. His drive, tenacity and his constant fight have allowed him to get ahead, meeting the goals he sets for himself. That is why he is asking for the help of the loan. With it, he wants to buy a wood lot to cut it down and sell the lumber he harvests. This will be reflected in an increase of income which for him means more wellbeing for his family, even knowing the risks he faces doing this work.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell should result in greater profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSherly hopes that her business will flourish and she dreams that her child will finish his studies. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business. There, she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

It is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She needs a loan of USD 2100 to purchase two steers and forage for them. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, Arshaluys was able to organize her farming in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

I know that important goals are not achieved easily, but I\u2019m ready to put a lot of effort in my future occupation. I\u2019m ready to work hard and I\u2019m sure it is worth it.\r\n\r\n\"This is a new stage that starts in my life. I hope it is going to be a fascinating lifelong journey that I want to start at AUCA, an American type of education has many advantages that are important for me. I like that I can choose additional courses there at AUCA. I will be able to take economics courses that I think will be helpful later on in business and some psychology courses that are in my opinion generally needed in life.\r\n\r\n\"AUCA gives many interesting and unique opportunities to its students and one of them is financial aid that is open to all its students.

is an experienced farmer from Getap village of Vayots Dzor village. He lives with his wife and son. Gagik earns a living for his family through renovating cars. Gagik's son works in the private sector. The two of them are the only breadwinners of the family. As it is hardly possible to meet the family's needs based on their salaries, Gagik and his family are involved in cattle breeding and agriculture, and in cultivation of apricots, cherries, apples, pears, and walnuts. They realize the agricultural products in the local market. To be able to continue his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Gagik needs a loan of USD 3000 to purchase calves and to buy some forage for cattle. He has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, Gagik was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Gagik and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1461963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Now I am happy to enroll at the American University of Central Asia, department of Business Administration. I\u2019ve been thinking of enrolling at AUCA since I first heard about it, when I was in grade 9. I started visiting the AUCA website, following the life of students and the campus. I realized that I can use my knowledge and advance it at AUCA.  I am really happy to be part of this great family.\r\n\r\n\"One of those opportunities that AUCA gives to all its students is Kiva loans. I need a Kiva loan too, because my family cannot afford to cover the full tuition fees. I would like to thank AUCA and Kiva for such a great opportunity and hope that I will be awarded one.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1461970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She has been busy with farming for more than 17 years. Mavluda grows wheat and potatoes. She also has a garden, where she grows apples and pears. Mavluda works hard from early in the morning until late in the evening, seven days in a week. She is the main breadwinner in her family, as her husband is a teacher and earns a small salary.

The main challenge is the slow purchasing power of her customers.\r\n\r\nFatmata is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy cups, food containers, and plates to sell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve her standard of living. In the future, Fatmata plans to open a big shop.

He has a big family, which includes his wife (in the photo), two daughters (20 and 19 years old), and four sons (14, 12, 9 and 6 years old). Robert's younger daughter works in the flower shop. To be able to take care of his big family, Robert is engaged in breeding livestock - sheep, pigs, and hens - and in cultivating walnuts. He realizes income from selling the agricultural products in the local market.\r\n\r\nAs the autumn is progressing, Robert needs to make some investments in his agribusiness. A loan of USD 1000 will support him greatly, enabling him to purchase forage for the livestock. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during more recent times, Robert has been able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So he has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Robert and his big family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain and develop their agribusiness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1462037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She offers a variety of grocery items at a reasonable price and has retained many customers who regularly shop at her store. Sadia makes enough to provide for her family. To make sure her store is fully stocked, she requested a loan of Rs 25,000, which she will use to buy rice, sugar and flour from the market at lower rates.

As life is getting more expensive with time, Mikhail wants to expand his agribusiness to be able to effectively meet his family's needs. A loan of USD 3,000 will support this young hard-working man, enabling him to purchase 25 beehives and the necessary materials for beekeeping (e.g., special medications and some wax). \r\n\r\nHe has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately, wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Mikhail was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history, and have no access to credit products. Mikhail and his grandmother will be thankful to all the lenders for their goodwill in helping them collect the needed

He realizes the agricultural products at the local market. \r\n\r\nFarming is an important source of income for the family. To continue running his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Andranik needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase two cows and several beehives. The loan will make his agribusiness more productive. Andranik and his wife will be very thankful to all the lenders for helping them collect the needed loan to maintain and develop their agribusiness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1462054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two cows and several beehives.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan, Syunik region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andranik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":153.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":157.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":158.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":158.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":160.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":162.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":162.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":164.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":164.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":167.81},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":169.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":169.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":171.27},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":172.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":174.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":177.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":179.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.81},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3000,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468039805}],"funded_date":"2013-12-19T20:50:41Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T16:21:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neda Elaidi","image":1353963}},{"id":621042,"name":"Benjamin's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Ivola village, Kenya, Benjamin has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser. Benjamin is a friendly 73-year-old member of the community, and he has 12 children. Benjamin lives with his family in a house with concrete walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof. He is a subsistence peasant farmer, his primary crops being maize and cassava. He actively participates in community prayer groups. \n\nIvola village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Benjamin and the 15 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nBenjamin has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Benjamin volunteered to be the promoter because, in his own words, \"I love my people!\" He wants to help the community by killing germs in drinking water and improving health. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Phoebe, Josephat, and Florence.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Benjamin\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1452818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers.

Emily is a 39-year-old, hard-working, well-known member of the community with no children. She lives in a house with concrete walls, a concrete floor, and an iron roof. She is active in several community groups, including a women's savings group and a burial committee. \n\nButiti village does not have a piped water supply, so the community members collect their water from a protected dug well. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria and viruses that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Emily and the 55 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nEmily has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. She volunteered to be the promoter because she is a hard worker and she wants to help the community improve its overall health. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Susan, Luka and Febe. \n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.

Meanwhile, Eloisa stays home cleaning, cooking, and taking care of their younger child who is just 4 years old.  Their hard work earns them roughly $550 USD a month.  \n\nRaul has worked hard for over 30 years and has been able to build a home for his family.  Recently, two bedrooms were added on the second floor, but there are some technical issues that were not considered and they need to make some urgent reinforcements before everything they have worked for crumbles down.  Before this expansion, the whole family used to live in a single bedroom; now the children sleep in their new room with just mattresses and no windows.  \n\nThis loan will help him make the payment for the materials needed to finish the construction and get expert supervision to ensure that all the investment on the second floor will last for years.  Raul has no access to credit with other organizations because he has an informal job that does not pay much and has irregular cash flows.

dispenser. Tom is a 69-year-old, hard-working, well-known evangelist pastor with 7 children. Tom lives with his family in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nItovo A village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Tom and the 25 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nTom has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Tom volunteered to be the promoter because he believes he is needed to sensitize the community on this helpful program. He wants to help the community by giving families access to safe water, thus helping to reduce their hospital expenses and allowing supplemental income for more important needs. There are also two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Isaac and Felisters.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Tom\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1460507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tom ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisters ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T18:00:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":625692,"name":"Laban's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laban, a 64-year-old subsistence farmer with 6 children and some primary school education, lives with his family in a home with mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof in Shikhambi village in Makuchi, Kenya.

The community of Musembe village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Musembe\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Musembe, 15 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Kennedy has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Prisca, Florence, Dorcas and Hestone.\n\nMusembe village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Kennedy believes that the dispenser will remove germs and improve community health. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Kennedy\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1459533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kennedy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hestone ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T15:21:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":625988,"name":"Eddah's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Shamalongo village in Kalwani, Kenya, Eddah has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kapchorwa\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Kapchorwa, 35 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mary, a subsistence farmer of maize and cattle, has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Hellen, Jacklyne, Jane and Francis. \n\nKapchorwa village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Mary volunteered to be a promoter because she is a leader and likes teaching people that chlorine kills disease-causing germs in drinking water. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Dancan\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1460600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dancan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenipher ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tabitha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T13:07:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":627144,"name":"Naseem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naseem is 27 years old.

Stellah is a friendly, hard-working, reliable, and well-liked business owner. She is 36 years old and has 3 children aged 4 to 18. Stellah lives with her family in a house with mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nBumira village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a lake, pond, or other standing water source. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Stellah and the 17 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nStellah has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Stellah volunteered for this position because she loves her people and wants to help them utilize this interesting program for the benefit of their own health. She wants to help the community by allowing more individuals to access safe water and stay healthier so that they don't suffer from water-borne diseases as much.

Kaptum village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from an unprotected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Shoghi and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nShoghi works as a subsistence\/peasant farmer, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Shoghi and other promoters in his community (including Liz, Mary and Phanice) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Shoghi will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Shoghi wants to be a promoter because he is service-oriented and aspires to change his community for the better. Shoghi believes that the dispenser will create positive change for people's lives by preventing diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Shoghi\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1463387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shoghi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phanice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T07:19:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":627167,"name":"Susanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susanna lives in Vanadzor city with her small family.

roof in Jedereria village in Shiru, Kenya. Paul has 7 children and works as a subsistence peasant farmer. The community of Jedereria collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Jedereria\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Jedereria, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Paul has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Salome, Wilson, Grace and Allan. \n\nJedereria village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Paul believes that the dispenser will kill germs in the water. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Paul\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1463413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kapkoi\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water.

His main source of income comes from the sale of milk, eggs and crops. He says that the most enjoyable part about farming is milking his cows, but the major challenge comes in controlling pests and diseases. Benjamin said that he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they cater to the needs of small scale farmers. After the microfinance training done by Juhudi, Benjamin appreciates the fact that in order to progress well in business there has to be good recordkeeping of all transactions.

A few days after applying for her first loan, enterprising and knowledgeable Bexis decided to plant tomatoes.  She used part of her loan, which she had left in case of any plagues or bugs that might affect the coffee crops, in order to buy certified tomato seeds.  With these seeds, she was able to plant on a small plot of land.  She had a great yield and sold it in the local market for a very good price.  This allowed Bexsi to pay off her first loan.\r\n\r\nNow Bexsi is applying for a second loan in order to continue investing in more tomato crops.
