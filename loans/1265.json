She has been running this business since after the war. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Rebecca says the main challenges to her business are price inflation and insufficient finance to expand.\r\n\r\nAbiebatu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items like rice, palm oil and cooking seasonings. \r\n\r\nThe extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and to increase her business. In the future, she plans to build a house. \r\n\r\nShe thanks you for your

She is in a civil partnership and is the mother of 10 children. She gives thanks to God for having allowed her to have a large and healthy family. Five of her children, who are minors, still live with her. The five older children already live on their own and contribute with their various agricultural work. \r\n\r\nIn her youth, Mar\u00eda Estela was unable to study because her parents lacked the resources and were unable to support her in her dreams. They decided to teach her to work the land, because she showed a great interest in her parent's work. \r\n\r\nShe has a plot of land which she inherited from her parents where she cultivates coffee and runs a small general store to help her spouse with the household finances. Her customers include coffee warehouses in nearby regions, neighbours and middlemen who are looking for high quality products to resell. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies such as urea, fertilizer, and other items that will benefit her coffee harvest.

Due to a lack of economic support from her parents, she could not finish her studies. \r\nAlba has a plot of land that belonged to her parents where she grows coffee. She decided to learn this work activity at a very young age. In her family, farming is a tradition. The profits from harvesting coffee when the crop is well attended and cared for are high. Also, it has been the only means of support for many generations. Her customers are the coffee shops in the surrounding areas, neighbors and intermediaries looking for a good product to resell. \r\n\r\nToday, she is requesting a loan to purchase farming supplies like urea, fertilizer and other items which will assist her coffee harvest. With the end of the season, she hopes to earn very good profits and to reinvest in her crops. \r\n\r\nHer plans for the future is to continue expanding her coffee crops by purchasing more land. By doing this, she can grow a better and greater quantity of coffee.

Las Cumplidoras are neighbors and friends from Olintepeque City, a 20-minute drive from Quetzaltenango in Western Guatemala. Thanks to the Friendship Bridge loans, these ladies have expanded their businesses and increased their income, allowing them to support their families in ways they formerly thought impossible. Eva Maria, who was reported on in a previous loan cycle, is making good progress in her business. The other ladies also are also making progress. In this new cycle, we want to introduce Claudia, an 18-year-old lady. Due to her family\u2019s economic situation, Claudia was only able to attend school through the 6th grade. She sells fruit in the market, about 20 minutes away from her home. She works a 12-hour day (6 am to 6 pm) 6 days per week. In her first Friendship Bridge loan cycle, Claudia is applying for US$384 in order to buy a variety of fruits, including watermelons, papaya, pineapples and mandarin oranges, which she can sell along with the pieces of fruit she currently sells. Claudia\u2019s father passed away 8 years ago. Therefore, all the income she generates from her fruit sales goes to support her mother and her four younger siblings, whose education she wants to help continue. They are now are in the 4th through the 9th grades. In this first loan cycle, Claudia will have the opportunity to share her experiences. During the monthly trainings, she will also learn from the other ladies about children\u2019s education, women\u2019s health and business, and money management among many other important

The community of Maganda village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Maganda\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Maganda, 25 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Hellen has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

She volunteered to be the promoter because she is loved by the community and wants to help the community to get safe water with chroline. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Anyika, Eliud, Beatrice and Judith.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Isack and the 70 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nIsack has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Isack volunteered to be the promoter because he likes working for the community and he wants to help the community by providing access to safe water, which he believes will help prevent water-borne diseases. There are also two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Sylivia and Alfred.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Isack\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1464435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isack ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylivia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfred ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T17:17:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":628644,"name":"Patrick's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is 26 years old, has 3 children, and he lives in Sieguti village in Muhudu, Kenya.

He has been involved in farming for four years. On his farm he has cows and poultry and grows crops, especially maize.

He enjoys the good returns he gets out of farming, while his biggest challenges are the diseases that affect the crops and livestock.\r\n\r\nJames chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because of their low interest rate. When asked what he learned from Juhudi's microfinance training session, he said that saving is very important and microfinance institutions give you an opportunity to do that.

This will give his family a better standard of

She lives with her two sons in the Hamadoni district of Tajikistan and has experienced both happiness and sorrow in her life.  A few years ago, Rajabi divorced from her husband and was left alone to raise and provide for her two children.  Before her divorce, she used to sell children's clothes on the street and also went to other districts and villages to sell her merchandise. \r\n\r\nRajabi's children are getting older -- they are now 14 and 10 years old.  Rajabi wants to spend more time with them because they are at an age where they need more attention and supervision.  Rajabi would like to start sewing traditional Tajik outfits for women from her home.  At the moment, she is finishing a course in cutting and sewing, and once she has purchased a sewing machine, she is planning to take her own orders and offer sewing services to the women of her district.  \r\n\r\nRajabi is taking a loan to buy a modern sewing

She lives in the company of her husband with whom she has a daughter: Juana, who she cares for in the house that she inherited 25 years ago. A few years ago she opened a grocery store on the outskirts of the city. This idea went very well so she started selling and gaining many customers. That's how she got the idea to expand her business and improve it by opening a restaurant, besides food she would be able to sell cold drinks since the heat of the jungle is strong. Now she has a complete space where the majority of profits are earned on weekends and holidays when visitors come from the interior of the country, as well as foreign tourists.

She thought up the idea of starting her own business when she started her family four years ago.  Her husband works in a mine and only comes home every 20 days.  This difficult situation gave her the incentive to start selling a range of chicken based dishes every weekend.  She uses roast chickens and sells the meals, which she advertises a few days before, from under her own large marquee.  \r\n\r\nShe says that the business is going well and she always earns enough money to help buy necessary things when her husband is not around, while also allowing her the time she needs to look after her little girls.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \u201cLas brisas\u201d and this is her first Kiva loan.  She is delighted to continue working with the other members of the communal bank because they are very supportive, welcoming and responsible.  \r\n\r\nEdith will use the 1500 Peruvian soles to buy chickens in bulk to continue with her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1463840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T07:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":156.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":174.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":169.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":186.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":193.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":195.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":208.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":215.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.24,"local_amount":156.11,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":158.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091849},{"amount":63.86,"local_amount":174.16,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-02T09:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":177.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778455},{"amount":428.9,"local_amount":1169.73,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1190.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598853}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T19:56:10Z","paid_date":"2014-04-15T13:00:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":627438,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is married with two children.

She has three children, who live at home in a wooden house.  Esther makes a living selling different supplies for maintaining vehicles, and has a garage.  Esther tells us that starting this business was a planned decision.  Her husband previously worked as an assistant at a local garage and he had always wanted to become independent and hoped to increase his long-term income.  The couple has had the business for 15 years and, over the years, they have developed a way to support the family economy. Esther manages the business, selling various supplies, such as oils and spare parts, for repairing vehicles, while her husband is a mechanic.  Esther is constantly looking to stock up the business with a greater variety of products, with different brands and prices, so as to offer a good selection to vehicle owners and drivers who are constantly visiting the shop.  This is Esther's second Kiva loan and she is grateful for the financial support that she is receiving in order to get ahead.  Esther promises to make her repayments on time.  On this occasion Esther is applying for 1000 Nuevo Soles in order to buy spare parts in bulk, and to buy lubricants and oils in certain brands that are popular with customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1464463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts and lubricants for vehicles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":107.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":115.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":131.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":136.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":140.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.26,"local_amount":107.37,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":111.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091850},{"amount":43.44,"local_amount":115.83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-02T09:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":120.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778456},{"amount":44.22,"local_amount":117.92,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":122.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598854},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":122.22,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":127.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147737},{"amount":48.23,"local_amount":128.61,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":133.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240828},{"amount":49.27,"local_amount":131.38,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-03T10:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":136.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258267},{"amount":51.19,"local_amount":136.5,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-01T11:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":142.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491502362},{"amount":52.56,"local_amount":140.17,"processed_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-25T12:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":145.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504306331}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T16:25:29Z","paid_date":"2015-07-25T12:10:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":627456,"name":"Walaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Walaa is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in the photo.\r\n\r\nWalaa is a 26-year-old married woman from Rafah city.

I have always had a dream to get a high qualification. I decided that AUCA is the best choice for me. In my opinion, this university offers very good conditions for study. It was not a problem for me to choose the most suitable university. But I found it a little bit problematic to select the faculty. After some contemplation I successfully made my choice, which is Economics. Comparatively recently I found out that I love working with numbers. Mathematics became my favorite subject. I am sure that AUCA will easily help to make me a highly qualified specialist. I would like to mention that AUCA gives many opportunities to its students and one of it is financial aid. I think it is the best way to communicate with students and attract such wonderful ideas and opportunities. I am applying for a Kiva loan, which will help me to cover my tuition

She sets up her stall in a busy location in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nShe started her business with her husband's assistance. Later on, she obtained a loan from Kiva's partner, the MFI Hekima. She's been running her business for four years.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy various products (two sacks of sugar, one can of cooking oil, matches, two boxes of candies, two boxes of biscuits, one crate of Fanta, one box of juice, one box of lotion, toilet soap, six \"pagnes\" (colorful African cloth), ten pairs of shoes, etc).\r\n\r\nThus, she hopes to send her children to school, expand her business, and buy a second lot of land.

She is a young entrepreneur, experienced, energetic, and a mother of four children, who are all students. Her husband is a broker. Kiso is a jewelry vendor. In addition, she occasionally sells 'pagnes' (the colorful cloth of western Africa). She sets up her merchandise at the public market and sometimes at her home. She started her business with her husband's assistance. Later on, she benefited from a loan from the microfinance institution Hekima. She has been in this business for twelve years. \r\n\r\nThis new loan is going to be used to purchase jeweled necklaces. Thus, she would like to provide schooling to her children, expand her business plans, and build a nice house. Challenges for developing her business include theft and outstanding debt.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, she thanks Hekima very much for promoting autonomy among unbanked women entrepreneurs, especially during this critical time of war in the country's east.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9900,"image":{"id":1465478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase jeweled necklaces to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

They are a Mazahua community who preserve their mother tongue and their traditional clothing is very colourful and attractive. To get to the community it is only possible to go by special transport or on foot since the bus only goes a couple of times a day at strange times. The group is made up of 5 women who are good friends and have known each other for several years. Leticia or 'Lety' is 35 years old and has been married to Alejandro for 16 years. Together they have 2 children who are still at school. \r\n\r\nFor the last 10 years Lety has earned a living baking bread. She says she decided to go into this business as her in-laws were also bakers. Lety, her husband and other family members make the bread in a very small room where they have an oven. The whole process is done by hand and they have no tools. Every day Lety and her relatives can be found making their bread. The bread making process is very laborious and while they are working the oven needs to be very hot so that it is ready for the bread to go in. To make the bread they need to weigh the flour in order to calculate the quantity of sugar. They only use flour and sugar mixed with water to make their bread rolls. Lety said: \" Our difficulties are the lack of tools to make our work easier, the price of flour is very expensive as well and the price of sugar is going up a lot.\"\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the loan which Lety, Silvia, Irene, Aracely and Cristina are asking for from Kiva and Vision Fund will help them a great deal since they will be able to buy flour and sugar for making the bread. The celebration of the Day of the Dead is approaching and this is when they sell the most and have already secured orders.\r\n\r\nThey are very happy and grateful because their loan will help them a lot and more so because their profits will be good. Lety's dream is to continue supporting her children in their schooling so that they can have a professional career."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":1462912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Guadalupe Cote, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":4925,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":64000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5919.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6049.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6182.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6318.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":6457.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6599.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6744.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6892.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7043.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":445.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":455.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":465.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":486.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":496.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":507.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":530.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":542.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":901.31,"local_amount":11712.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":11756.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644496},{"amount":941.41,"local_amount":12233.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-31T09:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":12279.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877957},{"amount":983.21,"local_amount":12776.7,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":12824.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766987},{"amount":1026.89,"local_amount":13344.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":13394.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247789},{"amount":1072.18,"local_amount":13932.93,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":13985.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072856}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T21:56:52Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":627555,"name":"Nyevu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Nyevu, whose previous loan was a big help in her business.

He lives in a peaceful community known for its national festivals.  The inhabitants come from the \"mazahua\" indigenous tribe and keep up their mother tongue and brightly-coloured traditional clothes.  Arnulfo has had a grocery store for six years.  It first belonged to his grandfather, who worked there for 50 years.  However, when he died, no one worked in the shop for three years.  Arnulfo had promised his grandfather that he would keep the shop just as his grandfather had always kept it.    Previously, Arnulfo's grandfather's shop was in a house made of tiles and wood, with adobe walls (a material made with earth.  Arnulfo's grandfather build the house, and it is one of the oldest in the community.  The shelves, doors, and window frames were all made of wood.  For Arnulfo, this house has a lot of character, and he wants to keep it forever as it was a present from his grandfather.  Arnulfo has been running the shop for five years and he is very happy with it.  He has always liked working in sales as his father was a businessman too.  On this occasion Arnulfo is applying for a loan in order to buy items such as milk, bread, eggs, refreshments, detergents, and more. He needs this loan to buy more merchandise and so that the business does not collapse.  Arnulfo's current challenge is dealing with competition.  Arnulfo lives in the centre of his community but there are also two very big shops.  Arnulfo always tries to be very attentive with his customers so that they become loyal.  Arnulfo has never thought about leaving the business because he promised his uncle that he wouldn't.  Arnulfo's father used to have a ranch with many animals and Arnulfo would like to have more animals, such as pigs, oxen, and fighting cocks.  However, unfortunately, he had pigs who became infected with a virus, and he was unable to continue with this work.  Arnulfo would like to have more animals in the future and he is sure that he will manage it with the saving he will earn from the grocery store, from selling gas, and from selling roosters."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1462180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, bread, eggs, soft drinks, sugar, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Barrio San Francisco, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arnulfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1463.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1497.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1532.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1568.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1604.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1642.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1680.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1719.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1760.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1801.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1843.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1886.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":348.34,"local_amount":4494.76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4543.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644498},{"amount":245.99,"local_amount":3174.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-31T09:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3208.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877959},{"amount":390.93,"local_amount":5044.2,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5099.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766989},{"amount":276.06,"local_amount":3562.02,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3600.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247791},{"amount":288.68,"local_amount":3725,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3765.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072857}],"funded_date":"2013-11-14T17:31:10Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":627590,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is 38 years old, married to Samson, and supports seven members of her family.

They live in a very quiet community where the people generally make a living by growing corn. They chose this name for their group because where they live there is a stone quarry from which they quarry stone to build their houses. Francisca, or Fran as they call her in a friendly way, is a group member; she is 36 years old and has been living with Mr. Antonio for 10 years. They have two children together who are going to elementary school. Fran works breeding sheep; she fattens them and then sells them. She has been doing this for three years. She says that she started this business because, when they offered her the loan, she decided to buy sheep and also because it is very convenient for her; she doesn't need to invest a lot of time in it, when she has the time she takes her sheep to the pasture to graze and takes her children with her as well to play with them while the sheep are eating. The only problem Mrs. Fran has is that sometimes her sheep get sick. Whenever she can and has the means to do it, she takes her sheep to a veterinarian to save them. This time she is requesting the loan to purchase four young sheep. She is very grateful for this opportunity because she will be able to buy her animals and sell them in a few months: \"With my profit I can help my husband with our living expenses and buy necessary things for the education of our children such as school material, shoes etc., as well as pay their school tuition.\" The other members of the group are Teresa, who will use the money to sell cosmetics; Alberta and Mr. Mario, who will invest the money in a convenience store; and Rosa, Laura, Francisca and Basilia who will use the loan to buy sheep.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6900,"image":{"id":1322880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy four sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Valerio, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":6900,"lender_count":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Alberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":11250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1725,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644497},{"amount":1725,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-31T09:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877958},{"amount":1725,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766988},{"amount":1725,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247790}],"funded_date":"2013-11-10T21:21:42Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Gasca","image":null}},{"id":627595,"name":"Kebbeh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kebbeh is 26 years old and lives in the West Point area.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He is 50 years old and has been in a common-law relationship with Sra. Susana for many years. They have a family that includes four children, all of whom are studying. Don Bruno has a taxi that he offers as public transportation. He started this business 10 years ago because he did not have a steady job. There were many occasions in which his income was unpredictable, so he decided to provide public transportation services so that he could live without any financial worries. Don Bruno sought support from a formal company so that they help with with the license plates for his taxis. The negotiations took four years before he finally received his concessions and license plates for his taxis. Don Bruno currently has one taxi that he uses every day for his work, but he also has additional vehicles that he makes available for rent to help other people have a job. This time Don Bruno is requesting a loan in order to pay off a credit for the services of his taxis. For Don Bruno it is very important to have his taxis in good condition because it will help him improve his services and compete with the other taxis, which is the biggest difficulty he faces.

He says he learned the trade from his parents. He does a variety of jobs because some of these businesses are seasonal, but this strategy provides continuous work. He works as an electrician in his neighborhood and in surrounding areas. He sells hammocks at the side of the highway so that motorists can see the merchandise he makes. \r\n\r\nHe has applied for a loan to buy a case of silk thread to weave hammocks and to pay personal expenses. He wants to have a variety of merchandise available to sell to customers during the upcoming holiday season, a good time for business. He hopes to grow his hammock business, which would create local jobs and allow him to develop personally.

She has had her business for around five years.\r\n\r\nFabiola is planning to invest her new loan in purchasing charcoal to sell in her community.

She and her 6-year old son live together in a house that she owns.  Nancy is a teacher by profession, but she started her own grocery business a few years ago after deciding that she couldn't meet her goals on a teacher's salary.  She opened the grocery in a space on the ground floor of her house.  She sells everyday products--sugar, rice, milk, etc.--along with cell-phone credits and drinks (called \"cremoladas\") that she makes herself.  This is a tropical region and demand for the maize- and maracuya-based drink is strong.  Nancy is applying for a loan that she will use to stock her business.  The loan will be her second Kiva loan and she says that she is grateful for the support because it has helped her to get ahead.  She is committed, she says, to repaying the loan in the agreed-upon time.

With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Uno de sus obst\u00e1culos fue cuando reci\u00e9n empez\u00f3  y se qued\u00f3 sin capital de trabajo debido a que dejaba fiando el producto a sus clientes, luego no pudo recuperar el dinero, pero esta experiencia le sirvi\u00f3 de mucho para no volver  a hacerlo.

","en":"Mar\u00eda is 40 years old, she lives in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, a very commercial city found in a hot and humid area of Ecuador. It is a city which has grown a lot over the last few years because it is the bridge between the coastal regions and the mountain. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has two children, a 13-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, they study in the public school near her home. Nine years ago, through need and the desire to get ahead she decided to set up her business. She buys live pigs and sells the meat in a stall located in a main street of the city. She tends to the business four days a week: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 7 am to 1 pm. One of the challenges she faced was when she had just set up and she was left with no working capital as she had left the product with her customers and was unable to recover the money later on. However, this experience was worthwhile in order to not repeat it. Now thank to her business' income, she has been improving her home little by little even fitting out rooms for rent.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda became aware of the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa through neighbors who recommended it for the services that the institution offers. She tells us that she is very grateful as she has had three loans and the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has helped her very more improve her quality of life because she was able to improve her sales and improve her home through these loans. The loan that she is now seeking is to buy more pigs as in this season, demand grows and she needs to meet her customers' needs to therein gain a good reputation in the city."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1464550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-11-06T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-05T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Orfelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":727.06,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":57.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":58.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":60.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":61.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":68.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.42,"local_amount":106.07,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":109.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995285},{"amount":118.54,"local_amount":114.91,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":118.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102370},{"amount":58.77,"local_amount":56.97,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":58.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212260},{"amount":61.97,"local_amount":60.07,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":61.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138260},{"amount":63.57,"local_amount":61.63,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":63.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832269},{"amount":64.91,"local_amount":62.92,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":64.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258421},{"amount":66.07,"local_amount":64.05,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":66.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540776},{"amount":1.55,"local_amount":1.5,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530546975},{"amount":67.31,"local_amount":65.25,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":67.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516128},{"amount":70.01,"local_amount":67.87,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":70.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649713},{"amount":67.88,"local_amount":65.82,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579564528}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T00:08:01Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:19:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":627624,"name":"Merab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merab is a 53-year-old married man.

To take care of her family\u2019s everyday needs, Ruzanna is engaged in cattle and pig breeding, in beekeeping, and in cultivation of potatoes and apples. Her husband sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of the family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nAs the autumn is progressing, Ruzanna\u2019s agricultural business needs some investments to continue developing in a sustainable way. A loan of USD 3000 will be a huge support to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling them to purchase forage (hay and concentrated forage) for the livestock. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it. However, thanks to their hard work in recent times, Ruzanna was able to run her farming business in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo Ruzanna has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Ruzanna and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them maintain their farming

Her breads are very famous because they are made in a traditional style which involves cooking them in special ovens. Her profit from this business is 150 AZN.

She lives with her husband (in the photo) and three sons. Her sons are currently labor migrants in Russia; they work there and send some money to their parents to take care of their needs. Maya is a teacher in the village local school. Her salary is so low that she cannot afford a living based on that alone. With the help of her husband, Maya is engaged in beekeeping; breeding a livestock of cows, pigs, and hens; and cultivating wheat, sunflower, grass, and strawberries. Maya's husband realizes the agricultural products are a very important source of income for them. Their honey has a very high demand in the local market. To sustain and develop their agribusiness, Maya needs a loan of 2,000 USD to purchase twenty beehives. As this is Maya\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who did not have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. Maya and her family highly rely on the good will of the lenders and will be very thankful to them for their support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1463188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
