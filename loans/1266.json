He is married with one child aged one. He would like to use his Kiva loan to buy fertilizers to use during rice production; he needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, Edik was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Edik and his daughter will highly appreciate the lenders support and will be thankful to them for their good will.

He buys all the accessories to offer his customers at an increased price.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Asitu herself never had the opportunity to receive an education.\r\n\r\nAsitu has been engaged in her business for the past three years. She learned the trade from her mother. Her primary business obstacle is that sometimes her customers buy on credit and do not pay on time. She enjoys her business because it makes her self-sufficient. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan in order to purchase sugar, flour, and popcorn for her business. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to build a house for her family and to take good care of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1463252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She says that her main problem for her business is the scarcity in fish when weather conditions are very poor.\n\nHannah requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone to purchase more fish to sell. \n\nShe says that the extra income from this loan will help her increase her business and have a permanent business location. \n\nIn the future, she would like to expand her business to a higher level. She is grateful for your support.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1462072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

hardworking woman who is 51 years old. She lives in a rural area of the J. Rasulov District. She has two children. Huvaydo is a single mother. Unfortunately, for personal reasons she divorced her husband and is raising her children alone. Huvaydo works in a nursery school as a child-minder. She likes her work a lot as she really loves children. However, Huvaydo receives a very low salary. This is why her son works in the Russian Federation. Her son sends her monthly remittances when possible.    \r\n\r\nFor a long time now, Huvaydo has wanted to build a house. Last year, she started construction but did not finish building it, as she did not have enough money on hand. Now Huvaydo plans to finish building her house, however she does not have enough money, which is why she turned to Arvand microcredit organization for a loan. It will soon turn cold and Huvaydo would like to finish building her house as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWith the received loan, Huvaydo plans to buy construction materials and hopes to finish her house before winter.

He lives with his parents. Vagharshak is the only breadwinner of the family. He runs a local retail shop selling women's clothes and handbags. The assortment of items sold in his shop is not that big and needs to be expanded and updated periodically in order for his small business to function in a sustainable way. Vagharshak currently needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase women's clothing, suitcases and handbags to resell in his shop. With the help of the loan, Vagharshak's small business will become more compatible. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during recent times, Vagharshak was able to run his business in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Vagharshak will be thankful to all the lenders for helping him to maintain and develop his small business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1461335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

He studied until the seventh grade in the canton school, walking with his brothers 3 kilometers to school. When his mother died, his father could no longer send him to school so he worked in the field with his father and his brothers.\r\n\r\nHe is married and his wife takes care of the house and the 5 children who are 17, 16, 15, 13, and 5 years old, respectively. His only son is currently studying in the morning and afternoon, taking a baking course. Jos\u00e9 works the land, planting 1.10 hectares of corn and 0.35 hectare of red beans. He worked with his father since he was 7 years old, and then independently since he was 13. He also works as an assistant buyer of cassava in the area where he works picking out the cassava and transporting it to the city market. In his free time he works with his family on his own crops. His crops are near his home, but he has to buy the supplies in the city traveling some 7 kilometers towards the city and later he returns carting the supplies on his back to the farming site.\r\n\r\nHe will invest the loan in the rental of 1.05 hectares of land to plant cassava or manioc, buying agricultural supplies, preparing the land, and buying supplies (herbicides and fertilizers). He and his family will do the manual labor of handling the crop agrochemicals.\r\n\r\nThe customer hopes that with this loan he will have more income for his family, as he sees this as a business opportunity with this crop, as it takes little work after implementation and with the residual moist land his crop develops and when the rainy season begins the roots thicken and they can sell within a year or so. He has seen some of the farmers from the area have good extra income after harvesting season.\r\n\r\nThe borrower plans that the loan will provide additional income for his family and the possibility of being able to expand his home, as his children are grown and need more space. Also, he would like to place his daughters in school again, as currently only his son is studying.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1464594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to rent 1.05 hectares of land for planting cassava or manioc, buying agricultural supplies to prepare the land and to buy supplies for cultivation (herbicides and fertilizers) so he and his family can manage the manual labor of handling the agrochemicals for farming.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future, he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He is married to a farmer and they have six children. He would like to use his Kiva loan to pay labor costs and buy fertilizers during his maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future, he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

They own cows and pigs, as well as plant corn and wheat on their land. Danijela uses the cow\u2019s milk for her family and also sells the milk and other dairy products in her neighborhood. She is a very hard worker who wants to have a better life for her family and is therefore requesting a loan to expand her stable and eventually increase the number of cows and pigs she owns.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Buying fertilizer will allow her to increase her production. With the anticipated profits from her farming efforts, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She lives in a minority community in the southern part of Kosovo. Her husband works as a guard for a private company.\r\n\r\nBased on tradition, Slavica is involved in agriculture, earning money by working on her and her neighbor's land. She is a very hard worker and plants vegetables, corn, and wheat to harvest for her family's dietary needs, to sell for income, and to earn a fee harvesting and working her neighbor\u2019s crops. \r\n\r\nSlavica enjoys her work and is satisfied with what she does to help her family.

She is living in the southern part of Kosovo; the city she lives in is known for handicrafts and trading. For the last 10 years, while her husband works hard in construction in order to earn a living, she has been making and selling handicrafts to assist with supporting the family financially. \r\n\r\nShe operates her business from home and sells locally to her customers with good success. At this time, she is requesting a loan in order to purchase more materials for her work for generating more income and allowing her to continue her business.

He would like to use this Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He is single and lives with his mother, who works as a seamstress.  They live in the city of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, situated in the coastal region.  It is a very productive city, and its people are very dedicated to commerce, since it is the city that connects the mountains to the Ecuadoran coast and is well visited.\r\n\r\nSamuel finished high school thanks to his parents' support, and one of his dreams is to study medicine.  However, due to a lack of funds, he decided to postpone his studies.\r\n\r\nThis brave and entrepreneurial man has made his living doing construction work in order to cover his expenses and help his mother with household expenses.  Nevertheless, he felt that he should work harder in order to achieve his dream.  That was how he came to visit the offices of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, because a client gave him very good references and he found out that the institution helps young entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nSamuel needs this loan to be able to buy 40 quintals of rice and launch his small convenience store.  He learned this business from his mother, who in her younger days used to sell convenience store items, so Samuel already has customers whom he will visit in the afternoons providing them with delivery service.  Some mornings, he will continue to work as a construction worker.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy because with his earnings from the business, he will be able to save in order to continue his studies and be

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He would like to invest in the purchase of raw materials such as plaster, ceramic, plywood and paint.\r\n\r\nAlejandro has been selling through NOVICA since 2002. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I create retablos \u2013 colorful dioramas unique to the Ayacucho region of Peru. Each tiny figure is shaped and painted by hand, and displayed in a delightful tableau.

To increase production, he would like to invest in the purchase of a new kiln as well as in clay, pigments and paintbrushes.\r\n\r\nWalter has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Our ancestors crafted beautiful and complex pieces with only their hands as tools, without the kind of technology we have nowadays. Through their work they expressed all that they saw and wondered about, their thoughts and beliefs. I feel that Peruvian ceramic art is a way to communicate with our ancestors and to keep them alive. Believe it or not, some archeologists have been fooled by my work! That's because of the aging process I use with my pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for collaborating with us by way of this microcredit.

She began her business because she wanted to create a source of income for herself. She works at her business from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm, seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of capital to expand her business.\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase more cream, earrings, bracelets, and chains to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and increase her business. In the future, Fatmata plans to expand her business more.

With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future, she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan is very important for Kamo, and he hopes for lenders' support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1463697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

In the future, she hopes to acquire another piece of land and leave it to her children so that they can build homes. In addition, she hopes to be able to tackle their financial and other problems favorably as farming is their only means of income to pay for the needs that arise daily.  Also, she wishes to provide her youngest son with the opportunity to enroll at the university and graduate\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1465083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase farming inputs to maintain  and care for her coffee crops.

Farrukh lives with his family in his parents\u2019 house in the Yavan region since he does not have a house on his own. He plans to launch a profitable business so that in the future he would be able to buy an apartment and live independently with his own family. He has already built a store using his savings and would like to open a grocery store there. He has already equipped the store with everything necessary, and all that is needed to start selling is to stock up on groceries. To achieve this goal, Farrukh has applied for a loan. He is requesting a loan in the amount of 3000 USD in order to buy a wide variety of groceries. He really needs this loan. Thanks to his loan he will not only launch a business brining him income, but also will be able to buy an apartment for his family. He eagerly wishes to have his own home.

To obtain the capital, Irum is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will provide the loan funds to her husband, for use in the business. He will use the funds to purchase a variety of cloth to sell, so that he can respond quickly to customer needs.

He finished secondary school earlier this year, and is currently enrolled at a Tajikistani university specializing in economics where he's been a finance major for the past few months. He thoroughly enjoys being a student, and is getting along rather well with his studies; he's been an ace at math since h\u0435 was a young schoolboy, so studying finance has been a breeze for him.  Apart from his studies, he frequents the campus library, and plays sports in his free time.  Afzalsho is taking classes on the campus in person, and paying tuition out of pocket.  He is seeking a loan to be able to pay for his studies, and is counting on your
