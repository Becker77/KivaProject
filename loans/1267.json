Additionally, she is happy to sell products coinciding with holiday dates that merit the purchase of these products by residents of the town where she lives. \r\n\r\nApart from her business, she has a soda fountain machine, with which she sells drinks made from passionfruit and corn. She wants to have money to continue stocking her business with wholesale merchandise in order to obtain extra earnings. \r\n\r\nHer long-term objectives include starting the construction of a third story for her home in order to convert it, in the future, to a house for renting out living quarters and generating regular income for the benefit of her family\u2019s finances. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the financial support that she receives for getting ahead.

He lives with his partner Mariuxi, 21 years old, who is pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child. Their house is located in the rural community of Virgen del Cisne. This community is well known for the cultivation of manioc and banana. It is a very productive area because it is favored by a warm and humid climate, and it is just a couple of minutes from the city of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, the commercial hub between the mountains and the coastal regions of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nDaniel works as an electrician, but when he realized that this income did not help him to provide for his family, he decided to start selling seafood. He has now been selling fish and shrimp in the neighboring communities for 3 years. Daniel travels there with the car of his father, who taught him this activity. Daniel now spends at least two whole days a week selling seafood, mainly when it is market day in the city.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of time, Daniel has gained experience and many regular customers, so now he considers travelling to further places in the mountain region to offer his products. For this he needs a loan which he will use to buy a motorbike, so that he will be able to sell his goods from his own vehicle. Therefore he approached Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa - neighbors in his community have benefited from this institution and recommended the services they provide.\r\n\r\nHe is happy about the help Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa can give him, and with the money he will buy his motorbike and also seafood to sell. He thanks each investor in Kiva for believing in him and in his undertaking even though they do not know him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1465130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorbike and expand his sales activities to other areas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-11-08T11:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-07T11:10:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristian Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1142.73,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":81.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":86.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":88.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":90.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":94.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":96.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":97.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":102.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":104.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":106.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168.52,"local_amount":167.45,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995287},{"amount":91.11,"local_amount":90.53,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":91.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413732},{"amount":183.71,"local_amount":182.55,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":183.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212263},{"amount":95.66,"local_amount":95.06,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":95.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138262},{"amount":611,"local_amount":607.14,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":611,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832272}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T22:22:40Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Vaethjunker","image":null}},{"id":629121,"name":"Cristian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cristian es un joven estudiante de medicina, \u00e9l solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para poder pagar la matricula de sus estudios, esta es su historia:Mi nombre es Cristian tengo 22 a\u00f1os de edad, tengo dos hermanos, soy soltero y no tengo hijos; mis padres se dedican a quehaceres dom\u00e9stico.\nSoy estudiante medicina en UCATECI, me he decidido estudiar esta carrera porque me apasiona la ciencia y adem\u00e1s me gusta ayudar a las personas.

Una vez realice su maestr\u00eda y regrese a Colombia, Yamid anhela trabajar como docente investigador contribuyendo en mejorar la oferta de productos de alto valor agregado.\n\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia:\n\nDesde que estaba en mi \u00faltimo a\u00f1o de universidad ten\u00eda claro que estudiar una maestr\u00eda en ingenier\u00eda en el exterior era una de las principales metas dentro de mi proyecto de vida. Siempre he tenido un destacado desempe\u00f1o acad\u00e9mico, pero actualmente no cuento con capacidad econ\u00f3mica para costear los ex\u00e1menes TOEFL, GRE y los dem\u00e1s requisitos para la aplicaci\u00f3n a un posgrado.\n\nA pesar de que cuento con el apoyo de mi familia para cumplir este sue\u00f1o, mis padres no pueden llegar a cubrir gastos tan elevados como estos, debido a su limitada situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica. Aunque en este momento estoy trabajando como asistente de investigaci\u00f3n en un grupo de investigaci\u00f3n en Procesos Qu\u00edmicos y Bioqu\u00edmicos Sostenibles, mi capacidad de ahorro es limitada y reunir el dinero que necesito para realizar el procedimiento de aplicaci\u00f3n me tomar\u00eda bastante tiempo, lo cual atrasar\u00eda mi sue\u00f1o por lo menos durante un a\u00f1o. En este punto el apoyo de KIVA ser\u00eda fundamental para poder acelerar mi proceso de admisi\u00f3n en el exterior, aprovechando esos recursos para obtener mi posgrado y por lo tanto, para acelerar mi regreso para el aporte al desarrollo del pa\u00eds.\n\nMi gran motivaci\u00f3n en obtener una admisi\u00f3n en una maestr\u00eda en una universidad l\u00edder en ingenier\u00eda qu\u00edmica es regresar a Colombia y contribuir en mejorar la oferta de productos de alto valor agregado. Colombia es uno de los grandes generadores de commodities en el mundo, produce y vende grandes cantidades de recursos como carb\u00f3n, petr\u00f3leo, n\u00edquel, entre otros. Mi objetivo fundamental es poder trabajar en la investigaci\u00f3n ingenieril que haga de materias primas, como las anteriores productos, acabados para la industria electr\u00f3nica, que generen m\u00e1s r\u00e9ditos a la peque\u00f1a y mediana industria local favoreciendo as\u00ed un crecimiento m\u00e1s equitativo.

He is the oldest of three children.  His parents have a drug store and with their savings, they paid for Yamid to study Chemical Engineering at the University of Atlantico, where he got the second highest classification out of the 26 graduates.\r\n\r\nYamid\u2019s dream is to go to Europe to do a Masters in Chemical Engineering.  To be able to do this, he needs Kiva\u2019s help, as it is the only way that he can cover the costs of his language exams, entry tests and university fees.  Once he has completed his Masters and returned to Colombia, he would like to work as a lecturer and researcher, helping to improve the range of high value-added products in the market.\r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nSince my final year at university, it has been clear in my mind that one of my main aims is to go abroad and do a Masters in Engineering.  I have always stood out academically, but right now I haven\u2019t got the funds to do my TOEFL English exam, GRE General Test or meet other requirements to get a place on a postgraduate course.\r\n\r\nAlthough my parents support my goals, they cannot cover such high costs because of their limited financial position.  Although I am working at the moment as a research assistant for a sustainable Chemical and Biochemical Processes research group, I can only save a small amount of money.  To get the money I need to apply for the course would take me a long time, putting back my dream for at least a year.  Kiva can play an essential role here in allowing me to speed up my application process.  With this support I can complete the Masters and be able to return sooner to contribute to the development of this country.\r\n\r\nMy main motivation for getting a place on a Masters at one of the leading universities in Chemical Engineering is so that I can return to Colombia and contribute to the production of high value-added products.  Colombia is one of the largest producers of commodities in the world, producing and selling great quantities of resources like coal, oil and nickel, among others.  My main aim is to be able to work in engineering research so we can use these raw materials to manufacture products for the electronics industry.

He is requesting a loan, which he will use to support labor costs and buy fertilizers during maize production. He needs fertilizer in order to increase his production. With the profits from his farming he hopes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

I think AUCA is the best university not only in Kyrgyzstan, but also in the whole Central Asia. AUCA has different departments: Anthropology, Business Administration, ICP, etc., but I wanted to study in the Sociology department. AUCA has high qualified teachers, who can convey their thoughts to students, it is very important. Another reason I like the university for is the spirit, which is very friendly and cozy. I already understand and feel my future job and I am ready for it. As a sociologist I will have skills in various fields. I also want to take part in different social events in improving the social status of our country. In future I would like to help people in need. \r\nAnother reason many students apply to AUCA is that it gives financial aid to all of them.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

I graduated from the Aga Khan School of Osh this year and entered the American University of Central Asia, Department of Psychology. \r\n\r\nI have studied all the subjects in the  English language during the past seven years at the Aga Khan School. Another reason is that AUCA is famous for unconventional methods of education, and there is no corruption, which is very important for me. \r\n\r\nAUCA is a university that gives a person great opportunities in the future. But the tuition fees are unaffordable for my family, because only one member of my family is employed. \r\n\r\nIt would be very difficult for me to focus on studying if I know that my family has to think on where to find money for my studies. Apart from that, I have two more sisters, and my older sister is studying at the faculty of Medicine of the State University in Osh. \r\n\r\nMy mother pays for her, too, so I need a KIVA loan to cover at least part of my tuition fees. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1464284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

She is married to Guillermo and they have a 12-year-old son. She lives in a wooden house that she built with her husband. She and her husband own land near their community on which they have grown cacao, turmeric, and annatto. In the beginning, she was lucky to have the support of her parents and her in-laws to purchase the land, which allowed her and her husband to use their income to support their family.\r\n\r\nShe likes her job because she can do daily tasks to maintain the crops correctly, like remove the weeds that grow constantly and use organic fertilizers to obtain better harvests. Many times, she hires local workers to help with these tasks and to harvest, since it is very complicated to transport the products in heavy sacks to the highways to take them to the storage locations.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support that she receives to move forward.

Last year I was lucky to get a scholarship for an exchange year in America. \r\n\r\nHigh school might sometimes be boring, so in order to keep a balance between academics and entertainment, I have been looking for extracurricular activities after classes. I was involved in volunteering and students council. There was an organization where all school leaders participated. It concentrated on public health, environment protection, and local development. I enjoyed organizing all kinds of workshops for school students about health and teenage issues over three years. We also had summer camps. The most exciting project was raising money for local park recreation. \r\n\r\nI was also involved in Student Council as a Minister of Culture and was responsible for every cultural event that took place at school and I got a lot of skills. All the above mentioned will give me a good opportunity to be an active part of social life at the American University of Central Asia. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately my parents can\u2019t afford full tuition at AUCA. My family is pretty big; it consists of six people. So I need a KIVA loan, because it will help me to think about education, to study well and not to think about finance.

He is from one of the towns in Chinandega, an area where there is mostly trade, tourism, and some of the largest industrial facilities in the country.\r\n\r\nCesar is a microentrepreneur running two businesses. One is selling basic household goods: a grocery store where he sells basic goods in small quantities, like rice, sugar, beans, oil, bread, candy, frozen foods, detergents, toilet paper, and other items. He also offers his customers adult and children's clothing, shoes, cosmetics, and fragrances. He started his business with capital from his own savings, money he saved up while working for a farming company. He also invested the money from his severance pay, since he decided to work for himself when he realized his neighborhood needed a grocery store. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to invest in his business by increasing his grocery store's inventory, as well as to acquire new products to meet his customers' demand. By having more products in stock Cesar wants to increase his sales and, by offering new products, people will come to shop in his business, so his profit will increase. \r\n\r\nOne of his dreams is being able to improve his home. He would like to install flooring, since he currently has dirt floors, and build bedrooms. He also wants to increase his business because he is his family's source of financial income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1464600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy household products as well as clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-11-08T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-07T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Augusto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.74,"local_amount":3005.61,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3193.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199702},{"amount":36.81,"local_amount":866.01,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":920.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449669076},{"amount":38.28,"local_amount":900.73,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":957.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459139713},{"amount":77.31,"local_amount":1819.1,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1932.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955472},{"amount":35.49,"local_amount":835.02,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":887.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490870900},{"amount":53.27,"local_amount":1253.31,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1331.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298167},{"amount":56.1,"local_amount":1320.22,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517581030}],"funded_date":"2013-12-24T22:44:51Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T14:00:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":629714,"name":"Fares","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fares is a 22-year-old single man.

She has been farming for four years, where she focuses on poultry and crop farming. Her source of income comes from the sale of eggs and crops. \r\n\r\nIn farming, she appreciates the fact that she will produce more output, and that really motivates her to work harder to produce more. Poultry diseases really affect her chickens and thus destabilize the growth of her business. \r\n\r\nRuth says she chose Juhudi Kilimo because they maintain good customer service with their clients. When asked what she learnt from Juhudi's required microfinance training, she said she had learned that the ability to rise from nothing to something depends on one's willingness and determination.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help her buy more poultry.

This is his story:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I have a great love for jewelry; this is my vocation. In the 1980s, my father learned to create designs with jade. With the passing years, he came to craft very good jewelry. When I was 12, I began helping in the workshop after school and, little by little, I learned the art. I hope to be able to sell my own designs so that my father's dream of having a large workshop can come true. I dream that my wife and I can go to college one day and work hard, so that we can give our children everything they need.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful for this opportunity, because it's a huge help to me and a way for us to get ahead. Often, we have to stop production when we run out of materials. This microcredit will let me buy a bit of silver and jade and develop new designs.

She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nIsha requires a loan in order to buy more clothing material to expand her business.

","en":"Olga is a 28 year old woman from the countryside, married with two chidlren who are 10 and 11 years old. Two years ago she begain cultivating potatoes on a rented lot under a community harvest system. She learned how to grow potatoes from her family. She sells her harvests in her town's local market, and by doing so earns enough income to support her husband with their home expenses. Olga tells us that with a lot of hard work and effort she has been able to overcome many difficulties that have arisen, especially the high costs of agricultutral ingredients and diminished prices at which she can sell her goods (which have caused the family some problems). Nevertheless, these difficulties have not stopped her from continuing her work, as her main goal is to get ahead so her children can have a better life. They are her motivation. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Olga is asking for a loan to invest in the purchase of wholesale agricultural ingredients (fertilizer, pesticide, and fungicide among others), which she will use to continue to care for her crops. With a more productive field, she will be able to sell better products at a higher price, thereby increasing her margins. She will be able to provide a better education for her children, improving not only her own quality of life but the wellbeing of those that she loves.

She works at the business 12 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is that moving door to door to sell her clothing material is very difficult.\r\n\r\nAlice requires a loan in order to buy a variety of clothing material to expand her business.

She takes the product there herself so she is knowledgeable about the city and business.\r\n\r\nShe now has two cows which she is thinking of feeding and fattening in order to produce milk which she would use to make cheese. She hopes to  carry out this new project as she would sell the cheese in the city, taking advantage of the trips she makes selling her harvests. \r\n\r\nThis is Modesta`s first loan with Kiva and she is pleased as she has the money she needs to improve her business and in the end her quality of life. Modesta will invest the loan buying organic fertilizer for her crops.

Nevertheless, she's known for being strong, active, and hardworking.\r\n\r\nAdriana's always looking for new alternatives so she can continue making progress.  This is why she's requesting the support of the loan to buy stock wholesale (soda, beer, snack food, and other things).  This will allow her to have available products to satisfy demand, which increases with the coming Christmas season.  She'll have better sales and improve her income.\r\n\r\nAdriana dreams of positioning her business and buying a store in the future so she doesn't have to keep paying rent, which is very costly and affects the family finances.  Doing this, she'll be able to give her children greater well-being and a better education as well as economic stability and a favorable quality of

Natela\u2019s son is a cook in a restaurant and Natela works as a dishwasher. Both of the family members get a monthly salary and they don\u2019t have their own business. Natela works throughout each day to generate income, but her earnings are too small to save and improve the family's standard of living. The family lives below the poverty line and receives a small amount of social assistance from the local government. \r\n\r\nNatela would like to start up a clothing sales business in her community in order to earn an additional income. She has applied for this loan in order to purchase a supply of clothing at wholesale prices to start her new business.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She is a farmer. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.  \r\n\r\nBeatrice is requesting a Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer to produce maize. She needs fertilizer to increase her production. With profits from her farm, Beatrice wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors to improve her capacity and yield. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1464947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer to produce maize","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2013-11-09T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-08T15:50:06Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-21T09:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":760366.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479279881}],"funded_date":"2013-11-13T22:27:58Z","paid_date":"2014-05-21T09:35:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null}]}
