She is a farmer. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.  \r\n\r\nBeatrice is requesting a Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer to produce maize. She needs fertilizer to increase her production. With profits from her farm, Beatrice wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors to improve her capacity and yield.

His father will assist him in this business since he makes furniture as well and has proper experience in that field. \r\n\r\nWith the received amount, Nika will purchase all the needed equipment and make furniture for sale: sofas, chairs and other items.

She started out selling empanadas and other fried foods, and then gradually moved into selling clothing and accessories. Then four years ago she saw the opportunity of opening a store in her own home as the community in which she lives didn't have a corner store. She sells daily necessities and is gradually introducing other items requested by her customers. Adriana is expanding her store based on this information. She works alone and loves her job as she likes to have an income of her own with which to help her husband with household expenses and provide her son with a good education.\r\n\r\nAdriana is now seeking a loan to help her buy more stock at wholesale prices (baked goods, cookies, soft drinks, cleaning products, milk products etc.) then she will have a greater variety of merchandise to offer her customers and satisfy their increasing demands. She will earn more money and have the opportunity to progress towards fulfilling her dream of owning premises independent of her home. She also wishes to provide jobs, as well as improve her family's and other families' standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1465766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

I was surprised to see such beautiful art pieces, and this aroused my interest in learning more. Several times during such visits, I picked up pieces of wood from the workshop and, when I reached home, I tried my hand at carving, following the process I had observed.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"The assistance I am receiving from you through this microcredit helps me so much. I thank you for helping me to grow my business.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Winfred's hand-carved wood sculptures on the NOVICA site:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8014\">http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8014<\/a>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1465140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to invest in the purchase of wood, his raw material, to increase production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Accra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.55 -0.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2013-11-09T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-08T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":16.95,"local_amount":16.95,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T10:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":16.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829235},{"amount":17,"local_amount":17,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449718880},{"amount":6.45,"local_amount":6.45,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459197652},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":29.75,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":29.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468016995},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T17:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240321},{"amount":29.85,"local_amount":29.85,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T17:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":29.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490936621}],"funded_date":"2013-11-09T19:23:50Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T17:38:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":629159,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is 40 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nEmily works hard to provide for her family.

In their free time, they enjoy spending time with their small children, and preparing traditional dishes such as \"Indio Viejo\" (a corn-based stew).  These women had to work from a young age due to a lack of financial resources.

She sells her products on the street from a 20 kilogram (44 pound) basket that she carries on her head.  She performs this work with pleasure, because this is how she supports her children.  Her goal with this loan is to invest in working capital, stocking her basket with snacks so that she will be able to obtain more earnings in the near future.  \r\n\r\nThe communal bank \"Grupo la Fe\" thanks the Kiva lenders for the help that they are giving to low-income people in poor countries like Nicaragua so that in the near future they can increase their incomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1465877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock her business with snacks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-11-09T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-08T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenza De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Johana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilma Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deudania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paubla Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoconda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":38500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6416.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6416.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6416.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6416.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6416.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6416.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":326.81,"local_amount":8117.51,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8171.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545952},{"amount":246.25,"local_amount":6116.49,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6157.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199707},{"amount":246.14,"local_amount":6113.72,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6154.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449669082},{"amount":247.33,"local_amount":6143.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6184.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459139719},{"amount":244.91,"local_amount":6083.24,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6123.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955478},{"amount":238.56,"local_amount":5925.71,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5965.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176243}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T22:30:28Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T12:56:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":629161,"name":"Ricardo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ricardo is 51 years old and married with three children.

She works at least 4 hours a day doing this since she needs time to care for her children. \r\n\r\nRight now she has 20 pigs and expenses for their feed.

They are responsible mothers and fathers with fifteen children under their care.  They are from Sauce, a place located in the northern part of the country.  Sauce is known for being a region that produces milk, cheese, and curds.  These people are known for being hardworking and responsible, with a desire for personal improvement.  Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t study for a university degree due to the poverty that they live with in rural zones.  Because of this, from day to day they fight to give their children a better future. That means that every day they have to put themselves at great risk to cross the river, because it is the only way to get around in the rural areas.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and her desire to get ahead, the coordinator is Priscila. She works as a mobile bread vendor, also selling it from her home.  Everyday she carries about 20 kilograms to sell--items such as crescent rolls, sweet pastries, pineapple cakes, cakes, empanadas, and basic bread.  She works in her business some eight hours daily.  The goal of her loan is to invest in working capital and to stock her business in the buying and selling of bread, so that in the not-so-distant future she can earn a better income.  The Milagro de Dios communal bank expresses their thanks that Kiva lenders give to people with scarce resources and in poor countries such as Nicaragua so that they can have a respectable job."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1465879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to invest in working capital and to stock items to sell such as crescent rolls, pastries, pineapple cakes, cakes, empanadas, and basic bread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-11-09T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-08T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alba Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pricila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Salvador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":58000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":585.68,"local_amount":14610.57,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":14644.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199708},{"amount":292.73,"local_amount":7302.41,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":7319.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449669083},{"amount":292.62,"local_amount":7299.73,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":7316.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459139720},{"amount":292.47,"local_amount":7295.97,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7313.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955479},{"amount":280.25,"local_amount":6991.32,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7007.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176244},{"amount":291.42,"local_amount":7269.75,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7286.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490870903},{"amount":289.83,"local_amount":7230.25,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":7247.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298170}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T22:16:37Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:15:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":629225,"name":"Anna Rizza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anna Rizza is 24 years old, married, and has two children.

Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can imagine the ideal person of Kyrgyzstan. It is a citizen who has a good education, sets long term goals of life. That\u2019s how I want to be. I was dreaming about studying Business Administration (BA) at AUCA. The idea and interest of this specialty came to me when I was participating in the \u201cTech Age Girls\u201d project organized by IREX. As a finalist of this project, I went to Bishkek for a two-week conference and learned a lot of useful information. This project totally changed my life and goals. During the conference, I have met with famous women leaders who achieved a lot in their life, such as deputy Shirin Aitmatova, US Ambassador to Kyrgysztan, Pamela L. Spratlen, and others. \r\n\r\nThe idea of studying BA came to me during the course \u201cbusiness etiquette\u201d. In this course I learned how business corporations work and how to behave in a business organization. In the second week of conference, I participated in a mini-internship at one of the IT companies in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nI want to learn more about production, how business companies use marketing to know the value of the product. In the future, I want to be a manager and a business woman in Kyrgyzstan. My ideal woman leader is Gulnara Kalikova. She is a successful business woman and I inspire her leadership skills.\r\n\r\nDuring and after my studies at AUCA I want to continue helping to people by actively participating in civil society initiatives. With gained knowledge and skills from BA department I want to contribute to the development of my country.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not able to afford full tuition at AUCA. I hope to get a KIVA loan to ensure that I will not have to struggle with my finances while I pursue my degree.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1465350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

I am from Almaty, Kazakhstan. I graduated Kazakh-Turkish high school this year, and enrolled in AUCA, department of Software Engineering. I consider AUCA as one of the best Universities in Central Asia, and it was long ago when one of my friends recommended me to prepare for it.\r\n\r\nI also consider the extracurricular activities of AUCA to be very useful and interesting for students. I have worked with AIESEC as a volunteer last year. This experience was necessary both for internship abroad, and I was happy to be selected as an exchange participant. After this selection, we had a conference in Issykkul. It inspired me and I joined AIESEC as a member. I was selected as a Vice-President of incoming exchange program of global internship program in AIESEC Bishkek. I was also a member of public and relationships communication team and incoming exchange program BOOM, and worked in outgoing exchange team. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I took part in organizing the Development Leadership Day, Global Village, etc. One of our responsibilities was teaching children, ages 10-16, English and other languages. All the above mentioned experiences will help me be an active participant of social events of AUCA.\r\n    \r\nAlthough there is another problem \u2013 finance restrictions of my family. Kiva gives financial support to students, which is great opportunity. I would like to apply for financial aid from Kiva, and hope that my candidacy will be considered as one of the best and valuable students to join AUCA. I will try all my best to meet all AUCA requirements in all its aspect.\u201d

She also opened classes at American Corner where she was teaching children drawing and making presentations on great painters of the world.\r\n\r\nAll the above mentioned experiences will give her an opportunity to take an active part of social life at AUCA, and greatly make contributions to it. \r\nBut her family cannot fully pay the tuition fees. So, Lira needs Kiva loan so that she could study without thinking about finance.

Below is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year I finished my high school and I did have ideas in which university I wanted to study, but the main question was who I wanted to be in the future. During the studies in my secondary school, I never thought that I would have a chance to study in the New Generation Academy, and I got more opportunity after studying in NGA, which is also within AUCA. Studying at the Academy taught me to be brave, ambitious and never give up even when I do not succeed in something. \r\n\r\nDuring the preparation year, I studied in all-round English, Kyrgyz and Russian languages; I also studied math, history and computer. Professors prepared us for our future education at AUCA. They also helped to determine our choices of which department to choose. I also gained huge experience in analytical thinking and communication skills. Preparatory courses at AUCA gave me all the necessary knowledge to become a deserving student at AUCA.\r\n\r\nSo, I chose the Psychology Department to study and I have been asking myself many times why exactly this department. First, I enjoy working with people and helping them in solving their problems. But in the beginning, I did not have much information and knowledge on this subject. Fortunately, I took part in the presentation of the psychology department. I'll never forget this atmosphere and the moment when the professors began telling us about something new we never heard about in our life. One of the professors said: \u201cPsychology studies the mental state of a person\u2019s inner world. The psychologist does not cure, but helps people to find harmony, both with you and with the people around you\u201d.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned made me think about the decision that I made finally. I am sure I will manage to be one of the best students in the Psychology Department at AUCA.\r\n\r\nThere are some financial difficulties in my family though and therefore I am applying for a KIVA loan. A KIVA loan will help me to fully dedicate myself to education and not to think about the money that would cover my tuition.\u201d

I have also participated in the contest 'Stolypin reforms' on behalf of the school, which was organized by the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University. I won second place and was awarded an encyclopedia. In the same year I represented our school in the district Olympiad of English language and won 3rd place. At another event, conducted by the International University of Kyrgyzstan, our team took second place. The competition was on developing a business plan. I was awarded a certificate for making presentations at the 'Science nourish young' festival, dedicated to the 300th Anniversary of the university. \r\n\r\nI am happy to enroll in AUCA, but unfortunately my family is not able to cover the tuition fees fully.

On balance with all pros and cons, I decided for myself that I want to study at the American University of Central Asia. There are a couple of reasons which hit me upon the idea to study there, such as: quality of education, strong teaching staff, uncommon system to study compared with other local universities, an opportunity to get two diplomas, a possibility to create your own studying schedule and choose subjects in accordance with your interest and preferences. \r\n\r\nTo achieve my dream, I created an action plan. As a first step, I entered AUCA preparatory courses. Just in a half-year, I improved my TOEFL results from 430 to 519. My maths score\/knowledge also became much better. This experience gave me an opportunity to see how the process of studies flows in AUCA. \r\n\r\nAnother reason which attracts more students is financial aid. I would like to apply for Kiva loan, too, as it will help me to cover my tuition fees at AUCA.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1465481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has been doing it for long time, has a ready market for her products, a good market site, and a good mastering of the business. The community will benefit from her regular supply of her products, have plenty to eat, and her dresses which are sold at moderate prices will provide the community with clothing and shoes for protection.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, Nkwlokoh Helen will cater for her family's needs, ensure her child\u2019s education, and pay her bills and rents. Part of the profit will go to increase her capital. She prefers GHAPE loans because of low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals and also the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed, also social needs of members are catered for at GHAPE.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":957464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy cocoyams, clothes and shoes for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

He works as an employee at a farm in the region where he lives. There he milks the cows and cares for the pasturage. He learned this work when he was a boy, thanks to the teachings of his father, who did farm work all his life. In addition, and to supplement his income, he alternates his job with caring for his own dairy cattle, since he has three cows located on the little pasture of his family home. They produce approximately 50 liters of liquid a day, which he sells to neighbors and friends in the area. His effort, his entrepreneurial spirit, and his enthusiasm motivate him to continue seeking alternatives that will help him to advance. It is for this reason that he is applying for the loan, with which he wants to buy two dairy cows. With them, he will be able to increase his production and thus improve his revenue from sales. This will allow him to continue working to accomplish his dreams of progressing, acquiring his own farm with ample pastures to continue his business in a totally independent manner without having to pay more rent. In addition, he wants to have many cows so that his business is productive and profitable, and this will allow him to help with the family economy, improving the conditions and standards of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":1465892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Mirabel has faced so many challenges in life, among which are inadequate finance to start up a business of her own and cater for her family needs, sickness, the death of her son and her father, and her husband's accident.\r\nWith this new loan requested Mirabel will expand her farming business by buying more of her business articles, such as bread, plantains, pure water (tangui), and sweet drinks, and will also add SIM cards retail to her business. She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has been doing it for about three years and has regular customers who buy from her. With this business activity, the community will benefit because Mirabel sells her products at moderate prices, and the distance to buy from the market will be reduced. \r\nConcerning the profit made from this loan, Mirabel will expand her farming business, ensure her children's education, provide medication when needs arise and save some for a bigger investment. She prefers GHAPE loan because of low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals and also the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are

They live in the parish of Turi in Cuenca, which is known for the viewpoint it offers of the city of Cuenca. There are many places to see there and it is surrounded by beautiful countryside. Its inhabitants work in agriculture, animal husbandry and various businesses in the city. \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Jessica. This is her third loan with the El Control loan group. She likes this kind of loan because of the unity and solidarity of all of the group members, and because little by little, their economic activities grow.\r\n\r\nJessica is a single mother to two beautiful children aged four and two. Her eldest child has just started school. They live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nJessica makes a living in various activities. She sells seasonal fruits in the market from Mondays to Saturdays, with no fixed hours. She has had this business for six years.

The major reason for this is that her husband does not have a profitable job at this time. She and her family are living hand-to-mouth.\r\n\r\nHer husband provides sheltering services to earn money to feed the whole family. When planks have broken and lost their smoothness, he replaces them with new ones. Now her husband is unable to continue his business without new planks. Therefore, Uzma requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy new, smooth wooden boards and bamboo to continue his business again. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will bring positive changes in her life and that her husband will earn maximum profit with the help of this loan. Uzma is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner because it empowers her husband to buy new sheltering materials for his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1465988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy wooden boards and bamboo for providing sheltering services.

She is married and has 3 children who are all currently in school. For the past 11 years, Loyce has been working hard to manage her clothes business, which sells different types of clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Loyce has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda.

independently. Only her youngest child is still studying at school. Bunna works as a civil servant, earning a monthly salary of USD80.00 per month. She also takes time to help her husband manage their farm in Kampong Chhnang province. \r\n\r\nThe challenge for Bunna is that she doesn\u2019t have her own motorcycle for commuting to her workplace, so she has to pay taxi fare for a ride.

In 2006, after the loss of her husband, she was forced to do whatever it takes to help her children live in good conditions. So, she started selling clothes from her home. With the unsatisfactory income that she earns, Hanaa is doing her best to support her children and provide them with needed education. She seeks to improve her business by purchasing a large quantity of clothes with the requested loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l. Her main objective is to increase her sales so that she will be able to gain a superior income and enhance the family\u2019s lifestyle. In the future, she looks forward to borrowing more Kiva loans and opening a proper clothing store where she will sell women's accessories as

Her husband sells the honey in the local market, where the honey is a product in high demand. To continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Gohar needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase new beehives. The loan will help her expand the agribusiness and meet the family\u2019s needs more effectively.

is a 41-year-old married woman who lives in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. She does not work; she stays at home and looks after her family members because her children are still very young and her elderly parents need good care.\r\n\r\nSidra's husband is very hardworking and loves his family very much. He is involved in his own business in order to have a regular income for the family. He manufactures and sells furniture, such as single beds, chairs, and tables. He started this business many years ago. He has many regular customers and is also taking orders from other cities. This business yields a good income, but his family's needs are increasing day by day and he needs more money to afford household expenses. \r\n\r\nSidra wants to buy more raw materials for her husband in order to expand the furniture-making business. This is why she came to BRAC Pakistan to obtain a loan.
