She is a native of Leon, which is in the western part of the country. Martha is described as a hard-working and responsible person who wants to better herself. She says that she likes to spend quality time with her young son when she is not working. \r\n\r\nSadly, Martha did not have enough money to go to school, and she had to go to work at a young age to help with the family expenses. She continues to work hard day after day to give her son a better future. Thanks to a lot of effort and her strong desire to get ahead, Martha has her own business, which is a small grocery store. She sells small quantities of daily use items such as rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, detergent, juice, soft drinks, matches, vegetables and tiste [a cornmeal and cacao-based drink]. Martha spends twelve hours each day working at her business and offering her products. She says she enjoys this work very much. \r\n\r\nMartha is requesting this loan to invest in working capital and to stock her grocery store with daily use items. She hopes to improve her income in the near future. Martha is grateful to Kiva lenders for the help they give to people with limited resources in developing countries like Nicaragua so that they can improve their incomes.

So by applying for this loan Arman asks for financial help to purchase a new stock of tools and materials. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan is very important for this young and enthusiastic man to be able to continue his business and gather more income for his

She already took used microfinancing through Hope Ukraine and with their help she was able to increase her income one and a half times (to 3,000 hryvnia). \r\n\r\nThis winter the shopping center manager, where Svetlana's store is located, decided to turn off the heating to save money. On one hand, Svetlana's rent did not increase (as she will not have to pay for heating), on the other hand it will be very cold and not comfortable for the sales people, nor for the customers. Though, if Svetlana was selling at an open market space, it would be worse. Therefore, Svetlana hopes that the future change will not have much impact on her business. \r\n\r\nSvetlana would like to expand her business. She wants to increase the assortment of goods in order to attract more customers. Svetlana requests a loan in the amount of 30,000 hryvnia to purchase goods: Jeans, sweaters, jackets and skirts.

green house farming. Since her previous loan, her children bought a house nearby and build two greenhouses there. This contributed to increasing the income. Alexandra would like optimize her business processes. Currently she grows seedlings in one of the largest greenhouses. Doing this, she loses time for sowing. Alexandra would like to build a separate greenhouse for seedlings. This will help reduce the sowing time, and will mean receiving the harvest earlier and sell them for a better price. \r\n\r\nAlexandra requests a loan in the amount of 30,000 hryvnia to build greenhouses for seedlings, and also to purchase seeds, plastic film and fertilizer. The loan will help her increase the income and thus improve the welfare of the family. \r\n\r\nLast year, Alexandra's husband suffered a stroke. He could almost not walk, but now he is improving. However he cannot work in the greenhouse. As it is hard for Alexandra to manage the business without her husband's help, her children help her.

life, and in order to get success she has had to work a lot. When she got married, it was difficult for her and her husband to find work in the village and the family had financial difficulties. They lived together with their parents and decided to work with a traditional business, which their parents worked with all their lives: Growing vegetables. They began to make every effort to develop this business. \r\n\r\nThis entrepreneur is very hardworking and accurate, the house and the garden is always in order. However, in order to get the best results, she needs more investment. Therefore, on the advice of her friends, she asked for help from Hope Ukraine. Thanks to the previous loan, Natalya was able to install heating in two out of four of the greenhouses, which increased the income. Therefore, Natalya would like to install heating in the remaining two greenhouses this year, and install a new, powerful heater, which will heat all the greenhouses. This is Natalya's dream and she works diligently to realize her dream! \r\n\r\nNatalya requests a loan in the amount of 40,000 hryvnia for the heater and already this winter, the cold will not be intimidating. Natalya and her husband will be able to sow early seedlings and then the income will increase considerably.

She makes enough to provide for her family.\r\n\r\nTo make her store fully stocked, she requested a loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan, which she will use to buy rice, sugar, and flour from the market at lower rates. In this way she will be able to meet the increasing demand consistently.

With a career as a chef, he expects to earn $20 a day, a substantial increase from before. \r\n\r\nRonald's parents were never able to complete their primary education. For his family, finances have always been tight. With three other siblings, Ronald is unsure how he will be able to finance his education on his own without the assistance of a Vittana loan.

The chain is made on a hearth by hammering cut lengths of red-hot wrought iron rod into oval links, one link passing through the next to form a cable. He solders each joint to give it strength.\r\n\r\nNowadays his gas cylinder for soldering has been finished, and his soldering rods as well. He has spend all his savings upon necessities; this is the reason he is not in a condition to buy a new gas cylinder and soldering rods. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Shehnaz requested a loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband would be able to buy a new gas cylinder and soldering rods for making chains. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of seven children and it is very difficult to feed all of them daily.

She also sells bollos de mazorca, which are rolls of corn dough that are wrapped in husks, steamed and served with shredded cheese. Maritza received the restaurant from her mother, who asked her to look after it while she took some time off. Since that time, Maritza has not stopped.  \r\n\r\nMaritza\u2019s restaurant is located in her own home, and it is open every day from six in the morning until three in the afternoon. She makes her sales in cash and on credit, and she buys what she needs in cash at wholesale warehouses in the municipality of Puerto Colombia, which is on the edge of the Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nMaritza\u2019s goal for the future is to separate the restaurant from her home and remodel her house to make it more relaxing and comfortable for her family.\r\n\r\nMaritza currently has a contract to provide lunches, which has improved her income and brought her new customers. She says that she is applying for a Kiva loan because her ability to purchase supplies is less than what she needs.

Here is her story:\r\n\u201cThere are lots of universities in Kyrgyzstan. In my opinion AUCA is the best university in our country. It was founded in 1992 and since that time it has produced many talented and successful students. I am very much interested in this university because of the elective educational system. I believe that it is very important that you can choose the subjects which you need in your future profession and life. The second reason is that AUCA stands against corruption. AUCA values your diligence, desire to study and acquire knowledge; thereby this university provides professionals and experts that our country really needs. AUCA gives its students lots of opportunities. There are many different clubs, conferences, and events that help students to broaden their mind, to become more independent and help to build their personalities. Furthermore, AUCA has international cooperation with other colleges and universities, for example with Bard College, which means that AUCA can provide the possibility to earn a Masters Degree abroad. One of the opportunities that AUCA gives to its students is financial aid, which is very helpful. I would like to apply for a Kiva loan so that I could cover my tuition fees.\u201d

his family had a difficult time after leaving their homeland, the Republic of Georgia. It has already been 16 years since they came to Ukraine. Volodya has a wonderful partner in his wife, and they have five children. Volodya worked very hard to feed his family and save money for a good house, since he is after all, the head of the family. It took a while for them to be able to buy a house, and it was a joyful occasion. With the house came land, where Volodya now grows vegetables independently. First he planted tomatoes uncovered, but it didn't bring much profit. He then began to build large, permanent, arched greenhouses. The greenhouses are comfortable to work in, and harvest has significantly increased. Now it is time to think about heating, so Volodya is requesting a loan from Hope Ukraine to buy a complete boiler. Volodya has received loans several time for development of his business, and he is very grateful for the assistance given. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":1463910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase and install a greenhouse heating system ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-11-11T02:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-10T02:10:01Z","loan_amount":4900,"lender_count":148,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1523.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Volodya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1680.81,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":20011.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":769.19,"payment_id":517560675},{"amount":1695.69,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":20011.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":754.31,"payment_id":530043483}],"funded_date":"2013-11-23T22:01:14Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T13:14:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":630094,"name":"Aileen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aileen is 33 years old and married with three children.

Her two other children go to school and it is very difficult for her to provide them with higher education. Shazia wants to generate some savings so that she can provide higher education to her children, but it seems impossible in the absence of a profitable source of income. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been driving an auto rickshaw for many years and he is earning enough for their expenses. He has to maintain the auto rickshaw but he does not have a sufficient amount of money to fix the problem. Therefore, Shazia requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband will be able to repair the auto rickshaw. \r\n\r\nShazia hopes that she will be able to create enough savings while their young children grow, and that she will be successful in providing higher education to her children. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1466716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"and her husband fix the problem with the Auto Rickshaw.

He wasn't able to keep on studying because of his family's financial situation.  He's married and his wife spends her time taking care of the home.  Currently his five dependent children live in his house.  They're students who they help him with the farming chores in their free time.\r\n\r\nJulio makes a living in agriculture growing basic grains (corn and beans).  His parents taught him to do this job from a young age.  He earned a living in agriculture because it was his only alternative for work and income at that time.  In addition to farming, he also generates an income for his family in ranching, buying and selling cattle.  Julio has to walk for 30 minutes to get to where he works.  He also has the help of his children and his wife with the farming labor.\r\n\r\nThe loan Julio's requesting is to buy agricultural inputs and to harvest the corn and beans.  The loan will help him harvest the crops better and more efficiently in a timely fashion and without any complications or loss.\r\n\r\nJulio wants to have a better quality of life for himself and his family in the future.

Ukraine from the Republic of Georgia. As time passed, he met a wonderful woman, married, bought a house and began to farm. He has applied all his strength to trying to make his business more profitable each year. At first he grew vegetables unprotected outside, then built small greenhouses, and they redid them again so that he now has large hoop greenhouses. The organization Hope Ukraine helped Khoren greatly in building the greenhouses. \r\n\r\nKhoren has fantastic helpers: his wife and four children. This year one of his daughters was married, so Khoren wanted to put as much extra work in as he could in order to help the young couple start their life together. He started heating the greenhouses, but it didn't go well. He got low quality, toxicant tubing, which caused his seedlings to die. Still, Khoren did not give up, and is again asking Hope Ukraine for help, so that he can buy a new boiler and  tubing. He very much hopes that this time he will have a good harvest and earn extra income which he can use to help his children.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":1464022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a quality greenhouse heating system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-11-11T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-10T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":4900,"lender_count":159,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1523.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khoren","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1680.81,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":20011.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":769.19,"payment_id":517560676},{"amount":1695.69,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":20011.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":754.31,"payment_id":530043484}],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T06:38:31Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T13:14:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":630125,"name":"Estrella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estrella is running her general store in her community to earn a living.

cucumbers. In the courtyard, he has a beautiful house with impressive cleanliness and order. \r\n\r\nLast fall, thanks to a loan from Kiva, Sergei installed a heating system and greenhouses, and was very happy with them. In March, he planted cucumbers and spent night and day heating the greenhouses. He was expecting a successful harvest, but over time he noticed that the plants were not growing actively. He measured the temperature, and it turned out that the soil was not warm enough. Sergei was concerned because cucumbers are heat-loving plants, so he began to investigate the problem. He discovered that the heating pipes had leaks, and thus were half empty. Sergei was disappointed; the harvest began much later and he lost profit.\r\n\r\nNow Sergei is requesting a loan of 40,000 UAH in order to buy new, quality hoses, as well as coal for heating. Sergei is hoping that next year, everything will work correctly -- after all, he loves order!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4900,"image":{"id":1464046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy new hoses and coal for heating greenhouses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-11-11T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-10T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":4900,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1538.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergei ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3361.62,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40023.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1538.38,"payment_id":517560679}],"funded_date":"2014-01-08T16:38:39Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T12:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie M","image":null}},{"id":630138,"name":"Neng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neng, 40, is a resident from the Samrong district of Takeo Province.

Vodyanoye, in Ukraine.  For many years already, he has been growing vegetables such as radishes, tomatoes, zucchini and parsley on his plot of land.  His hardworking wife and daughter help him run the business.  Alexander is a good farmer and he loves his work.  Next to his house, he has created a beautiful courtyard with a paved driveway, a new vineyard, and a gazebo where it is nice to relax, in the shade, in the summer.\r\n\r\nEverything is in order on Alexander's property.  He has built seven greenhouses in which he manages to sow crops and get a harvest three times per year.  Alexander is very serious about his business.  Whenever he learns something new, he tries to apply it to the business.  This year, he wants to install a heating system inside his greenhouses, as he has seen how profitable it has been for many of his friends to install heating systems in their own greenhouses.\r\n\r\nAlexander is requesting a loan of 40,000 hryvnia.  He is ready to start a new season in well-heated greenhouses.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, Alexander is featured with his

For many years, she worked as a secretary at a state farm, and was loved and respected by her coworkers for her kind, sympathetic heart.\r\n\r\nLubov is now retired and can devote more time to her home business of growing tall tomatoes. In the past, Lubov worked in the garden with her husband, but he is now handicapped with spine problems and can only move with the aid of crutches. Lubov worries a lot about her husband and it was very difficult for her to continue with her business, but she now gets help from her son and they work together.\r\n\r\nThanks to previous Kiva loans, Lubov and her son built and equipped two greenhouses. There is enough space on her land for one more greenhouse. To avoid losing a year, Lubov decided to request a loan of 20,000 UAH and build the additional greenhouse.\r\n\r\nLubov loves her three children. The oldest are already independent, but the youngest needs support.

She also sells school supplies, ice cream, soda, and spicy snacks.  She works every day from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm.  She has many customers, including students that go there to meet together or do homework on the computer.  She has had this business for more than 3 years and has been expanding it little by little.  She started out with internet service and now also sells paper and many other school supplies.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy school supplies and also pay for internet service.  She has been with this communal bank for more than 2 years and likes it because she gets help with every loan.

Married and the mother of nine children, she lives with her husband and three of her children who work in farming and household activities.  Zoila completed only four years of elementary school despite her parents' efforts because she comes from a low-income family.\r\n\r\nZoila has worked with her husband in agriculture for five years, specifically growing coffee.  She learned this work from her parents when she was little; took her to work picking coffee on other people's farms to be able to survive.\r\n\r\nThey acquired part of the land where she currently has her crops with a lot of effort; she inherited the other part from her parents.  Her fields are located a kilometer from her house, so she walks there every day with her children and husband.\r\n\r\nEvery morning Zoila and her husband get out of bed optimistic.

been for the last 12 years. He works hard in his business and works four days a week. He also has a bar, which is his other source of income. He opens the bar when he is not working in the cattle trade business. \r\n\r\nJohn started his cattle business in 2001 because he thought it would reward him with big profits, which he would use to uplift the status of his family. He would like to buy more cows to make more profit and better cater to his family's needs. \r\n\r\nJohn\u2019s clients are mainly Rwandans, who buy the cattle and take them back to Rwanda. He hopes to expand the business and to use his profits to buy a big chunk of land for his family, which will benefit the family in the long run.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1466830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-11-11T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-10T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":333333.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":335598.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863666},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":167799.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752734},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166666.99,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":167799.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233712},{"amount":52.35,"local_amount":130885,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":131774.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490973605},{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":149784,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":150801.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504414693},{"amount":30.12,"local_amount":75309,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":75820.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692304},{"amount":57.61,"local_amount":144022,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":145000.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530922595},{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":833333,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":838996.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561809704}],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T22:30:20Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T15:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":630202,"name":"Takhmina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Takhmina is a student of the American University of Central Asia, in the department of European Studies.

The above listed things are very important in our life; they form our life. If we know how to manage our time and plan actions, we will succeed in many aspects of our life. These rules are used in the developed countries like the USA, European countries, etc. I also like European culture. The culture of the European countries plays a big role in world history, and I want our country to have good relationships with these countries. During my studies at AUCA I would like to get internships in some of Europe's countries. Fortunately the education schedule and system does allow students to take international internships. I would like to mention that this is not the only opportunity that AUCA gives to all of its students. One of them is a Kiva loan.

They live together in their own home made of wood.  Her main work is in agriculture and in growing products that are the most profitable in her area, including organic cocoa, a plant similar to the guava-tree, and others.\r\n\r\nShe began this work together with her husband, but it was a type of labor that she learned when she was very young, growing up together with her parents in the agricultural sector.  When she became independent from her parents, she did not have her own land.  Thanks to her savings, she was able to pull together enough money to buy her own plot. For her regular tasks and work, she has organic fertilizer and tools that are in good shape; she uses them for weeding, cutting the stems on her cocoa plantations, and for other tasks that are necessary for a good commercial-quality harvest.  When her products are ready, she harvests and later sells them to buyers; this allows her to recover the money that she had previously invested.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the financial support that she receives in order to move herself ahead.  She promises to pay her installments on time.  With this loan, she is requesting 1,000 soles to buy organic fertilizer.

district, Prey Veng province. Like the other villagers, Chana is in an agricultural culture, primarily growing rice to sell. The income generated from farming is barely enough to satisfy their daily needs, so Chana also runs a small tailoring shop in the village to earn additional income. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Chana\u2019s family doesn't have a safe latrine for use at home, so she wants to improve their sanitation and personal hygiene. In this particular way, she has requested a loan of 1,300 US dollars to build a household latrine.

For that reason, Gloria sees that she needs to request financing to purchase kitchen utensils, primary materials, to have a sign made so that her small business will be more visible, and to buy tables, and chairs so that her customers may be seated.\r\n\r\nGloria's dream is that some day, her small business will cease to be small and she can have adequate conditions for her customers to be more comfortable, helping her obtain better income and improve services over those currently offered. \r\n\r\nWith her improved earnings, she plans to create a recreation area for children and families, innovating her business and making a grand success of it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1467130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth"],"use":"buy kitchen utensils and equipment to attend to customers.

He is married to Elva and has two children with whom he lives in their own house made of wood. He is a very hard-working and has an abundance of love for his family. Thirteen years ago he started growing things like cocoa, coffee and achiote (a spice) on the land that his parents gave him to start his married life. \r\n\r\nFidel comments that he didn't have a lot of motivation at the beginning, but with the arrival of his children that changed. For them he would give his life, they give him so much joy.

Economics. Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201c[A] few years ago a friend of my sister told us about her orientation week at AUCA, classmates, professors, classes and everything that she experienced at AUCA. Her story admired me so much, and I was always thinking about this place. After a small research and talking to students about different universities of Bishkek, I [came to the] conclusion to enroll AUCA. Among offered departments I chose the Economics Department. Of course other universities in Kyrgyzstan also have departments of economics and offer different specializations. However, the Economics Department of AUCA is a unique place where I will gain knowledge in English and will be granted Bard degree that provides a great opportunity to be employed with transnational companies abroad. Besides, I study in diverse community with students from all over the world, gain knowledge from high-qualified local and foreign professors, and will become demanded professional in high competitive job market. I believe that as a result, I will gain knowledge and skills that will lead and open doors to my bright future and achieve my goals to help not only my family, but also a community where I have obtained basic knowledge at school. I would like to mention that this is not the only opportunity that AUCA gives to all its students. One of them is Kiva loan. So, I would like to apply for it, so that I will be able to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1466953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She lives in her parent's house in Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a city known for its indigenous Tsachila residents and for being a productive farming and livestock-raising area. There is much commerce here, as it is the port of exchange between Ecuador's coast and mountain regions. \r\n\r\nJessica built her business over time and out of necessity and lack of employment. She began selling girl's headbands and chocolate balls that she made. As the business grew, she gained experience selling other items. She now has a bazaar in a school where she works with her mother, who also has a small shop. They help each other, and she works from Monday to Saturday for at least 10 hours a day. Business was very good this year, and she has added a copier and school supplies.\r\n\r\nShe has applied to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan to buy notebooks, pens, pencils, paper, and more to stock more inventory for the bazaar. Jessica expects to increase her earnings with this investment and be able to offer her son a better standard of living and all that he needs so that one day he will have a career. Jessica thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva for the support to make her dreams a reality. One of her dreams is to have a house where she can set up her bazaar and stop renting.

Malohat is one of these people, who tries to improve life conditions and stimulate economic being of her family.  She is divorced and raised her daughter, who is now 25 years old, by herself.  Her daughter has one child.  Malohat had worked at a kindergarten for many years.  Today, she needs more income because her only daughter became a widow and returned to Malohat's home after her husband's death.  Malohat started her own business in reselling women's and children's clothing three months ago.  In order to develop her business, she completed the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained a certificate.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of 10000 somoni to purchase women's and children's clothing to increase her new business working capital.
