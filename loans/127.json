Muhammadjon is the father of three children, for whom he has to take care of and provides daily sustenance. He has dedicated himself to the agriculture industry since he was very young and has acquired experience. In this way, he is able to maintain his family. \r\n\r\nToday this gentleman needs to acquire a loan to buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for planting wheat, watermelon and onion. For this reason Muhammadjon has come to IMON International to obtain the  necessary loan so that he can continue caring for his humble family that needs his support. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 2 children who are 7 months and 5 years old. \r\n\r\nRachelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rachelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nRachelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She 's from central Santa Mar\u00eda. She makes clothing and also has a business buying and selling livestock. She's been supporting herself for the last 4 years. She works from home, making clothing but she also travels constantly to the fairs in Taraco, Juliaca and Azangaro where she sells livestock. Depending on the schedule of each district, she usually works at the fairs on Thursdays or sometimes Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays -- it's very tiring, especially transferring livestock. Eduarda enjoys the financial independence her job allows her as she can help with household expenses and feel useful in society. Her wish is to continue working hard in order to better her economic stability, and as such, be able to have a family of her own in the future. With the money from the loan, Eduarda would like to buy more material to make her clothing and more livestock so she can increase her income.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Beatriz Yuste, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":213651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy more material to make clothing, and increase the amount of livestock she has to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-15T13:57:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-29T20:54:37Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336150},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957379},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227629},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422864},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":179.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116087},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":179.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011047}],"funded_date":"2008-10-15T20:54:37Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Yuste","image":1669109}},{"id":73670,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 5 hijos que ya son independientes y la apoyan mucho.

She is married and the loving mother of three children, who are the reason for her daily fight for a better life. Shahodat sells women's traditional dresses and skull-caps in one of the famous local markets called \u201cPanjshanbe\u201d. <P>\r\n\r\nShahodat is a very hard-working woman. She always achieves all her goals and overcomes different challenges with natural optimism. She is requesting a loan of 1000 USD for the term of 12 months to re-stock her inventory. She is hoping to purchase more merchandise at affordable wholesale prices for further retail sale. The only dream of Shahodat is to ensure her children of a good education and to make them happy. We believe Shahodat\u2019s integrity and the consistent growth of her venture in the past years can guarantee further stable expansion of her venture and timely loan repayment. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Now the \"Chinese\" is driving himself and is very happy for this. \r\n<p>\r\nAt 4:00 AM he is already queuing up in line waiting for his turn, but many times, before his turn people ask for his services. On these days his earnings increase from 40 soles per day to 80 soles, which is why he always gets up very early. Victor plans to work very hard to improve the quality of life for his family, and have another business so that his wife does not have to sacrifice so much at the farm. Victor is going to his wife's village bank because she had to travel for the death of a family member. Now Victor is assuming his wife's responsibility of attending each of the payment meetings.

against any harm brought about by poverty, as they grow old. She joined ASHI, a KIVA field partner in the Philippines, to be able to access a loan. This opportunity will enable her to put up her own business, bandi making (coconut candy making), and be economically independent from her husband who is a farmer. Bandi is one of the famous delicacies of Antique province. Most of the customers buying this delicacy are tourists and they are buying bandi for a present when they go home to their own places. Profits she will be getting out of this business will be her means to augment her husband\u2019s sporadic income. Most of her earnings will be saved for her and her husband\u2019s needs in the future and some will be used to support her children\u2019s family, which is also poor. Though her children no longer live with her, she can\u2019t afford seeing them suffer because of poverty. Through loans she can request, she believes that the business she\u2019ll be financing will bring change to her family's lives.

She owns and operates a weaving business, primarily selling personal home products like plastic wares to local community members. She has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jovita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC.\r\n\r\nJovita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her ninth from GDMPC.

This will increase Getrude\u2019s sales revenue and enable her to pay her daily bills including her children\u2019s school bills.\r\n\r\nGetrude belongs to a group of nine members who hold each other accountable and insure one another in paying back the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":524700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase farm tools like hoes, manure and mulches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-17T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gereva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Slyvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaudensio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jolly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":316666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145.42,"local_amount":298699,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":300313.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767285},{"amount":162.91,"local_amount":334635,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":336443.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662303},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":316666.01,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":318377.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689075},{"amount":144.26,"local_amount":296315.99,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":297917.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903295},{"amount":151.08,"local_amount":310318,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":311995.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296859},{"amount":153.12,"local_amount":314516,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":316216,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467194},{"amount":14.04,"local_amount":28850,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":29005.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182606001}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T17:51:30Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":197426,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary sells planks at retail prices to her customers in Ibadan.

Even though they are financially independent, her children still live in her house located in the city of Pichanaki.  Her farmland produces all types of natural products that are indigenous to the area.  Roberta has been farming with great care for the past 15 years.  In addition, she manufactures bricks along with her husband.  They both enjoy the work and find it rewarding since it allow them to live comfortably.  What she enjoys most about farming is clearing her land because it allows her crops the best chance to develop properly.  However, transporting her harvest to market is difficult because the loads are heavy and the cost of moving the freight is expensive.  Her entrepreneurial spirit has proven to be an advantage because it has enabled her to continue working.  Roberta now yearns to open a grocery store in her home where she can sell retail and wholesale with hopes of becoming one of the largest distributors in the area.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Roberta is familiar with the work methodology of her Communal Bank and happy to continue her membership because her group is very close and demanding when it comes to completing their payments.  As a result, Roberta has become a responsible person.  With the loan she requested, Roberta will hire workers to rid her farmland of weeds.  She will also buy insecticides to guard against pests that can impact her crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":541988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase insecticides & hire workers to remove weeds from her land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":526.9,"local_amount":1437,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1496.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886440},{"amount":23.1,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":65.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327844}],"funded_date":"2010-05-21T17:32:22Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":205620,"name":"Ami Chantal Essenam","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme s\u2019est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans le commerce  de pagnes  depuis 2007, elle a associ\u00e9 \u00e0 cela la vente d\u2019eau en sachet  appel\u00e9e pure WATER.

There she sells pozole, tacos, enchiladas, tostadas etc. She opens the restaurant on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. During the week she sells vegetables from a stand she has in the downtown area.  She is married to Isidro, a butcher, and they have 3 children together. The eldest girl is married. The second youngest is 12 years old and she is in primary school and Jesus Guadalupe is 1 year old.  She wishes to invest in her business with the purchase of grocery items.

She and her husband work hard because they are having a house built for them. She says that they are saving to purchase windows and doors.

In 1993, in order to find a means of subsistence, they went off to Russia in search of a living and worked in a cafe. In 2006 they came back to Kyrgyzstan and opened a cafeteria in Osh city, using a start-up capital of 20,000 KGS. They worked a lot to make their caf\u00e9 one of the most popular places, and achieved success. \r\n\r\nBut in June of 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in Osh city, Gulsara lost her business. Her cafeteria was robbed and burned. But Gulsara, being a very optimistic person, didn\u2019t give in. In order to reconstruct her cafeteria, she decided to engage in reselling foodstuffs. She rented a selling place at the local market and took different kinds of frozen goods on credit from her business partners. This fact indicates a great confidence in Gulsara\u2019s personality and the prosperous future of her business.\r\n \r\nNow, Gulsara is applying for a loan of 135.000 KGS, which she needs to broaden her assortment of goods.

She works selling different types of things on credit, including blankets, beds, pots, sets of glassware, and gifts. Wilma has on average 50 to 70 customers in different zones, including in public offices. She speaks with her future customers and they make different requests which she purchases and then later she collects payments weekly or monthly, with an increase for time payment. The advantage of this activity is that Wilma has her customers select the products they want rather than as with other persons, first buying the products before offering them for sale.

He and his family of four children all still live on the farm. He works the fields with his sons, one who is pictured, and they all share in the profits. He also grows watermelons, maize and green peppers on his farm. He will be very happy to receive a loan and hopes he can invest in fertilizers and pesticides to nurture his crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":25974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Ovidio would like to invest in fertilizers and pesticides for his rice farm where he also grows watermelons, maize and green peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T20:26:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ovidio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T21:46:22Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":950,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T19:20:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24202},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2007-07-20T17:13:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33943},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2007-08-20T18:21:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44797},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T17:30:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71886},{"amount":646,"local_amount":646,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:17:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":646,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107738}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T21:46:22Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:17:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12222,"name":"Maria Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>My name is Maria C. and I sell farming products.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

this group loan. Moung C. is a 59 year old widow and mother of two children. One of her daughters helps to feed the family by working as a garment worker. Moung C. currently earns a living by growing both rice and vegetable crops in the village.

Any move, breath, or an awkward gesture can tumble the house. However, provided that needed care, patience and labor is given, the output is a lot more valuable than just a house made of cards. Saltanat T., 29, is the leader of this group. She is unemployed as she has to stay at home with the children. Her husband is a new entrepreneur. He buys sheep in a mountain region, brings them to town, and sells them at the cattle market. He used to do another job, but because of health problems had to get a leave without pay. On one hand he is happy as he has started his business earlier than he thought. If he were to have got this leave later, the opportunities would not be as abundant as this time. Saltanat has applied for this loan to help her husband buy five sheep, bring them to town, and resell them.   \r\n\r\nSaltanat\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nAinakan A., 49, is a wife of a private builder. Ainakan trades in fish and her monthly income is $240. She hopes to obtain this loan and buy tools for her husband and purchase fish for sale. \r\n\r\nKubanychbek S., 33, has two children. His wife trades in cell phone cards. Kubanychbek provides for his family by working as an operator at a gas station. He also works as a taxi driver and at weekends he trades in sheep at the cattle market. Kubanychbek needs a loan to buy sheep.\r\n\r\nBegayim A., 29, is a mother of two children. Her spouse is a general worker. Begayim is a cook in a kindergarten. She has applied for this loan to buy a car so that her husband could work as a taxi driver.\r\n\r\nKylychbek C., 31, has a son. His wife works as a school teacher. He earns his family\u2019s living by working as a builder. He needs a loan to buy tools for his work.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She lives San Felipe Jalapa de D\u00edaz in her parents\u2019 small house. She is a single mom of one daughter, Kimberly. Her mother is a housewife and her father works in farming, along with Yanet\u2019s three brothers. Because of the scarcity of resources in the community, her parents could not continue supporting her in her studies, so she never earned her degree. For this reason, she decided to look for a way to earn money, and started her business.\r\n\r\nCarmen, who has a restaurant in the community of Los Ideales, formed the group. Yanet and the other nine members joined her in forming the group, which is now beginning its first loan cycle. The group is named Los Ideales which, aside from being the name of the community, signifies for them, goals, objectives, and following dreams that one day, thanks to the efforts of each member and the help of loan institutions, will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nYanet needed this loan to invest in a business that she has run for a few months with her brother. She does not have an established location, but works from her home. She will invest the loan in the purchase of 100 young chicks, as she now has 50 that are ready for sale. She will also buy feed for the chicks and have a little left over to continue growing. \r\n\r\nAside from the raising and selling of chicks, Yanet has two other business activities, which demonstrates her entrepreneurial spirit. She makes earrings, bracelets, and necklaces from stones and colored beans. She sells these from house to house among her friends and acquaintances in the community. She stocks up on materials for the jewelry each month in the state of Oaxaca, and she re-invests her earnings back into one of her businesses.\r\n\r\nYanet also has a small grocery store located 15 minutes from her home in the community of Piedra de Amolar. Although this business is small, she tries to keep it stocked, as it is one of the few stores available for the residents of this town.\r\n\r\nYanet would like to have her own house in which to raise her daughter and give her a place to study, something she considers essential. She also wants to continue maintaining and enlarging her small businesses.\r\n\r\nThe Los Ideales group is made up of seven women and three men. Mar\u00eda del Carmen will invest in new furniture for her restaurant. Kicsia Irais will use her loan money to buy ingredients for the making of snacks. Jazm\u00edn will buy shoes to sell. Cecilia will buy young pigs to raise and resell to butcher shops. Otilio will buy young chicks to raise and resell. Reyna will buy cloth for her tailoring business. Nallely will use the loan to stock her general store. Mois\u00e9s will buy cloth, and thread for making aprons. Rogelio will stock his general store with rice, beans, sugar, cookies, and cleaning products.\r\n\r\nAll the members are grateful to know that organizations like Fundacion Realidad are there to help them grow and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":541463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Jewelry making supplies and stock for general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN LUCAS OJITLAN","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-05-19T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jasmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayelli Sugey ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Otilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moises ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kicsia Irais ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rogelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1312.5,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":16603.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715842},{"amount":875,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":11069.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899565},{"amount":875,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":11069.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639910},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5534.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854192}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T21:57:37Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":205652,"name":"Mariana Marlene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nMariana de 36 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona periurbana de Guayaquil, tiene un hijo que le ayuda en ocasiones.

To successfully fulfill the basic needs of her family in all the activities that they do, she opened a small store in her house two years ago.  She had to sacrifice the development of the store because of her constant health problems caused by a uterine fibroma. Not long after finding out about the fibroma, she had to undergo surgery in a local clinic in order to save her life.  Rosa is mother to 4 children and now only the youngest, who is 13 years old, is in her care.  For this reason she wants to continue to strive. At present she is in better physical and financial condition and she has been able to find work lending small amounts of money to her neighbors, which allows her to buy certain necessities to support her family.  Nonetheless, she longs to once again open her little store in order to lend her services and satisfy the needs of the general public.  For this reason she is requesting a loan of $350, which will be the first step in her effort to see her dream succeed.  We support a woman who can overcome any obstacle with bravery.

Currently he works at the Primary School in the district of Boane. He has worked with other credit institutionsin the past, such as Tchurma and Procredito. He stoped working with those companies because he realized that HLUVUKU's services were better, their interest rate was lower and it was located closer to his residence.  He found out about HLUVUKU ADSEMA through friends and co-workers. He was awarded a loan in the amount of 12,000.00 MT for housing purposes, which was repaid without any problems. He intends to use the loan amount of 15,000.00 MT to continue the construction project, more specifically to purchase cement and sand to build walls.

Concurrent with her professional obligations, she has been running a business selling incenses and clothing for fourteen years and enjoys great recognition.  Her countless customers are composed mostly of civil servants.  She receives orders both domestic and foreign.  She is in demand for marriages because her merchandise is highly prized by newlyweds.\r\n\r\nHere is the process of making this exquisite and sensational product:  you need 2 kg of magnonkis\u00e8ni (an exotic plant) seasoned with perfumes and <i>eaux de cologne<\/i> (30 bottles) for a month in order to have a nice scent.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about increasing her sales and about coping with customer demands, Fatoumata turned towards Soro Yiriwaso. She has been associated with this micro-finance institution for 36 months.  After four solidarity loans and an individual loan, all properly repaid, she is now on her second individual loan.  As the holidays approach, she intends to use the loan to buy 10 kg of incense seeds (magnonkis\u00e8ni), five outfits made of \u2019less-rich\u2019 damask, and some clothing made of \u2018wax\u2019 cloth. \r\n\r\nShe stocks up locally at the big market of S\u00e9gou and accepts cash or credit in her sales to customers, who are composed exclusively of women for the incense.

Her youngest child is only 5 months old and the oldest is just 9. She is married to John V. and the family lives in the village of Purok Paraiso, Brgy. Abuanan, Bago City, Negros Occidental. Renea aspires to help her husband increase their family income enough to sustain the needs of her children and provide for their future security.\r\n\r\nRenea is always looking for opportunities to provide her family with an additional source of income. First, she started a business selling a variety of native delicacies at the local school. As her small business prospered, she needed more capital to meet her customer's demands. This made her decide to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, which provided access to more capital for her business expansion. By her 3rd loan cycle, she already had some savings and was able to open a general store where she sells ready-to-wear clothes. \r\n\r\nThe new ventures were quite successful from the start and her husband encouraged her to put her skills into other possibilities. He suggested that they buy a sow so that they could start raising pigs in their backyard. This turned out to be a wise decision.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed PHP 15,000 to invest in her various business ventures, including hog-raising. She was able to repay her loan on time without any delays in the weekly installments. Now that she is borrowing her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she intends to borrow PHP 16,000 so that she can buy another sow and expand her general store,  which is adjacent to her house.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":393450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has four children: three sons of fourteen, five, and four years old, and daughter of fifteen years old. Her elder son and daughter go to school, and her two younger sons are at home. Her husband combines his job as mechanic at the company \u201cShumkar\u201d and cattle breeding. Aizat is a worker at the company \u201cShumkar\u201d and gets 6500 monthly. After their marriage, ten years ago, they started cattle breeding together from purchase of a cow. Together, they increased livestock numbers to thirteen and the cattle number to two. Monthly, cattle breeding brings 9000 soms. \r\n\r\nNow, Aizat and her husband are preparing their house for the winter period. In order to provide living conditions for their children, they need to make repairs at their house. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t have a sufficient amount of money. They are applying for loan in order to buy building materials and make all the necessary repairs at home in time.\r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nNurgul S., treasurer of the group, is 39 and married. She has two children. Her daughter is fifteen and goes to school. Her son is three years old and is at home. Her husband is in construction, and Nurgul is a poultry woman at the company \u201cShumkar.\u201d Like Aizat and her husband, Nurgul with her husband decided to make home repairs for the winter period.\r\n\r\nBolotbek B. is 44 and married. He has three daughters of two, five and nine years. The elder daughter goes to school, the second daughter goes to kindergarten, and the youngest is at home. His wife works at the company \u201cShumkar.\u201d  Five years ago, Bolotbek\u2019s relatives offered him the oppotunity to buy coal at low price in Karakeche and resell it at higher price in the Issykkul region. He started it with 20,000 soms, and it now brings 10,000 soms each month. He is planning to build a big house for his family. Unfortunately, he cannot yet afford it. Therefore, he decided to make just repairs at his house. However, he doesn\u2019t have enough funds. Thus, Bolotbek is applying for a loan in order to buy building materials and make necessary repairs himself.\r\n\r\nZharkyn Z. is 22 and single. She is a student but is expected to graduate this year from International Academy. At present, she is waitress at cafe \u201cZhibek Zholu\u201d. She lives with her parents. Her father makes profits on buying and selling coal. This autumn her last academic year will start. She wants to prepare herself and buy all necessary things for the studying process including clothing. She cannot buy it herself right, now but in the future she will have enough funds to repay all this money. Therefore she is applying for a loan. In the future, she is planning to graduate and work according to her specialization.\r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

To make a living, she has a store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste. She is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Delia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Delia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is married to Nayuyanye K. and is a father of six school-going children. He has been farming on his own piece of land for the last ten years.\r\n\r\nThis will be his second loan.  He learned about KADET from a colleague who was already a KADET client.

The store provides support for the house and his family, but doesn\u2019t bring in enough to support his home.  The business started with very little working capital, as an alternative source of income.  The loan will be used to buy basic grains, which is what sells the most right now.  His current goal is to establish a used-clothing store, which is turning out to be a profitable business.

The couple have three dependent children who they care for and educate in a rental house which is located in the upper basin of the Peruvian rainforest (in the community of Las Palmas).\r\n\r\nThe work that this selfless woman has been engaged in for three years now is farming.  Her main fruits are citrus fruits and pineapples.  However, it is the pineapple that provides Katrina with the most income.  She grows her pineapple over 9 hectares of farm land.  She is always caring for and harvesting her crop, together with her husband.  She tells us that the weeds that grow round about do not allow the fruit to grow.  What bothers her the most is having to care for her plantations whilst wearing plenty of clothes to avoid getting the pineapple spines in her body.  She adds \"With the intense heat in the rainforest, you can't work\".\r\n\r\nKarina is harvesting three hectares of pineapple and she is planning to travel to the capital to negotiate a better price for her crops.  In the future, she plans to become a nation-wide wholesaler.  In addition, she is planning to open a grocery store business in a small store near the town park, where her mom set up a similar business and made good profits.  This month she will take the first steps with the help of her community bank.\r\n\r\nKarina is a member of the \"Las Palmeras\" community bank and this is her second loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive a small loan from you in order to achieve her goals.  For her part, she pledges once more to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loan.  Karina enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members of the bank are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.  With your support, Karina will invest the money she has requested in setting up the grocery store that she is planning to open."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":802138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-29T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1516.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098503}],"funded_date":"2011-07-13T08:41:12Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":316307,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is  47 years old and married with 5 children between ages 13 and 29, two of whom are currently attending school.

mujeres que son muy trabajadoras y responsables, el nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque casi todas se dedican a las artesan\u00eda que son los bordados y tejidos, por eso son artesanas y lo de fresno por su comunidad.\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Juana es una persona mayor de edad conoce muy bien de donde naci\u00f3 el bordado y el tejido de la comunidad, ella tiene 69 a\u00f1os de edad ya es viuda ahora vive sola pero muy cercas de sus hijos y casi pasa todo el d\u00eda con sus nietos.\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Juana comenta que antes la lana era natural por lo que ahora ya no solo es sint\u00e9tica, antes ellos mismos elaboraban esta producto, primero lavaban la lana del borrego que sal\u00eda cuando les cortaban la lana, se hacia lino con la lana ya bien lavada y lo obten\u00edan con ayuda de un instrumento de madera, despu\u00e9s tej\u00edan todos estos hilos de lana hasta obtener una tela y finalmente pintaban la tela los colores mas comunes eran el negro, caf\u00e9 y gris. Las cosas han cambiado ahora ya nada de esto se hace porque las telas ya son de muy mala calidad.\nElla bordando lleva ya 30 a\u00f1os desde que sus hijos eran peque\u00f1os comenta que esto le ayudo de mucho para darles estudios a sus hijos tambi\u00e9n ayudaba con los gastos del hogar cuando su esposo se quedaba sin empleo, vend\u00eda todos los d\u00edas lunes en Ixtlahuaca sus bordados,\nAhora ya solo ofrece con sus conocidos de la comunidad esta sola y muchas veces pues no tiene para cubrir sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas como alimentaci\u00f3n, calzado y vestimenta por eso se dedica a esto, esta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar estambres de colores, tela y aujas.\nSu desaf\u00edo es que muchas veces sus trabajo ya no lo valoran como antes y no le quieren pagar lo que realmente es el precio, comenta que es muy pasado ya que se tardan varios d\u00edas elaborando este trabajo porque todo es echo a mano, ella hace chalecos, morrales, colchas, su\u00e9teres con figuras representativas de la comunidad, como p\u00e1jaros, gretas, estrellas, flores, etc.\nUna de las metas de do\u00f1a Juana es llegar a vender muchos bordados para poder compra ma\u00edz, porque si no comprar no tendr\u00e1 para hacer sus tortillas durante todo el a\u00f1o ya que es uno de sus alimentos primordiales de todos los d\u00edas.\nTodas las integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy agradecidas por el pr\u00e9stamo ya que podr\u00e1 compra todo el material que les hace falta y podr\u00e1n cumplir con sus pedidos ya atrasados.\nAngelina, Leonila, Lucia, Gregoria, Rufina, Rosio,  y Mar\u00eda Lucina invertir\u00e1n en los bordados, mientras que Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles y Juana Ir\u00edais invertir\u00e1n en cosm\u00e9ticos.\n\n","en":"The group \"Artesanas del Fresno\" is made up of women who are hardworking and responsible. They chose the group's name because almost all of them are artisans who make crafts like embroidery and knitting - so they called themselves Artesanas [artisans], and Fresno is the name of their community. \r\n\r\nMaria Juana is an older woman who is very familiar with the origins of embroidery and knitting in the community. She is 69, widowed and lives alone but very close to her children and she spends most of the day with her grandchildren. Maria Juana says that the wool used to all be natural, but now it's synthetic. They used to make it themselves, first washing the lambswool then making linen with the well-washed wool. They used a wooden instrument to obtain the wool. Afterwards they knitted all of their wool threads until they had fabric, and finally they dyed the fabric - the most common colors were black, brown and gray. Things have changed now and none of this is done the same way because the fabrics are of very bad quality.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing embroidery for 30 years, since her children were young. She says that it helped her to put them through school and also with their household costs when her husband was unemployed. She used to sell her embroidery every Monday in Ixtlahuaca, but now she only offers them to people she knows in her community. She is alone and often can't cover the costs of her basic necessities like food, clothing and shoes, which is why she works. This time she has asked for a loan to buy colored wool, fabric and needles. \r\n\r\nHer challenge is that her work is not as valued as it used to be and people don't want to pay a fair price. She says that it's very old-fashioned and it takes many days to finish a piece of work because everything is done by hand. She makes vests, bags, blankets, and sweaters with local figures like parrots, stars, flowers, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of Juana's goals is to sell more embroidery so she can buy corn, because if she doesn't, she won't have corn to make her tortillas all year, which is one of the foods she eats every day. \r\n\r\nAll of the members of the group are very thankful for the loan because they can buy the materials that they lack and meet their back orders. Angelina, Leonila, Lucia, Gregoria, Rufina, Rosio and Maria Lucina will invest in embroidery; Maria de los Angeles and Juana Iriais will invest in cosmetics. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":927661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric for embroidery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T05:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juna Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lucina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":862.46,"local_amount":12074.42,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":12093.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785158},{"amount":436.5,"local_amount":6110.96,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6120.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193720},{"amount":451.04,"local_amount":6314.62,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6324.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330081},{"amount":250,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3505.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044100}],"funded_date":"2011-12-02T05:14:50Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:39:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":369612,"name":"Eliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eliza works hard to support her family.

Before joining TYM fund, her family income was from pig raising and vegetable cultivation. It was difficult time for her family. Her loan from TYM was used to start a new business: sell pork. This proves to be a successful business providing her a stable income and combining with her husband`s salary, it  helps her family to overcome financial difficulties. In this round of loan she is requesting 10.000.000 to buy piglets to raise and investing more in her pork sale.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva

Most live with their immediate marital families. Their homes are in Sokoura-East, one of the neighborhoods of Dio\u00efla (one of the prefectures of Koulikoro, the second-largest administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The women got to know each other through business relationships built around selling clothing, which is their main activity. Intending to strengthen their businesses, the women decided to become part of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their fifth loan. All of the previous loans were successfully repaid. They are planning to buy 100 bolts of fabric from Bamako (the Malian capital) from wholesalers. The bolts of fabric will be cut into three sections and sold on credit in Dio\u00efla's market to customers including both men and women. They plan to make a profit of 50,000 Francs CFA from this loan and each one envisions using this money for health and education costs for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":262195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madoussou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dikore ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":101524.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440356},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":101524.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135734},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":101524.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033535},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":101524.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620903},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":101524.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019868},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":101524.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242626}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T17:11:39Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liana Bianchi","image":null}},{"id":90118,"name":"Jaleel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jaleel K.  lives in Bubal Afghanistan.

The death of her husband left her bereft, especially as she has to take care of her youngest, who has disabilities. Her business activities actually help her to slowly forget her grief and move on. Having a child who totally depends on her gives her a reason and motivates her to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nRemedios has a general store which she sustains through her loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon. This has been her source of income for the past 15 years and it provides her with a net profit of 8,000 Philippine pesos a month, enough to cover her small household's expenses and allow her to save enough to buy appliances, renovate her house and also invest in a frozen-foods business. She is very thankful for the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon because her five children were able to finish their academic education and because it continues to help her be independent and support her special child.\r\n\r\nShe just paid off her 13th loan cycle of Php 19,500 without any delays in the weekly installment. For her 14th cycle, she is borrowing Php 19,500 to continue the sustainability of her general store. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women.

Myriam Agossi was born on September 22, 1984 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She became situated in Dandji in Cotonou nearly eight years ago.  Married to ZANNOU Blaise, an embroiderer, she is the mother of two children who are both in school.  She lives with her children and husband.  The couple jointly ensures that family expenses are covered.\r\n\r\nMyriam Agossi stopped going to class in secondary school.  To meet her needs and those of her children, she started selling fresh eggs two years ago.

She is very organized in her personal and professional life, where she sells stationery supplies, clothing, cosmetics, jewelry, gift packs, as well as other items such as footwear and clothing on credit. Ever since she was young she saw entrepreneurship as a way to earn personal income because she has always been very independent, and for this reason she started with small store where she showed off a few items. Gradually the business kept adding more infrastructure and products like the ones mentioned above. Her system of identifying which products to sell is as follows: Madenis has a notebook where she notes everything her customers purchase every day and also records what she does not have but her customers request. In this way she has been able to increase her sales as well as the number of customers and obtain better profits. Madenis sells on credit and has about 25 hand-picked customers whose accounts rotate every 30 days, although she also takes cash. She reports a profit of 35 percent and capital of $2,280, with credit capacity at 94 percent. Her dream is to see her business grow and organize a big local business, but her biggest goal is to have her own home. It's for this reason she and her husband work hard every day to achieve this objective. Madenis belongs to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and this is her third loan through Kiva.

They have five children, but only live with four of them in a house that they own located in the San Juan area.  He works in farming and his main crops consist of potatoes, peas and beans.  He grows them on his own farmlands which he bought thanks to his 20 years of dedication to the business.  What Esequiel likes most is being able to sell his crops in his city\u2019s wholesale market, as he sees his efforts paying off.  Along with this job, Esequiel works in cattle farming where he cares for his animals, such as cows, bulls and lambs.  He can also make cheese with the milk that he obtains from them.
