Siwajibu managed also to put a new electricity machine, which currently provides electricity for every power user.

She set up a sewing studio in a small space in her home.  She works Monday through Saturday from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm and her oldest daughter helps her.  She learned this business from some friends and thanks to training courses provided by the mayor's office she was able to expand her knowledge and improve her technique, which has made her known in the area and won her contracts with good businesses for whom she makes uniforms.  Her charisma, drive, and dedication have allowed her to get ahead and previous loans have provided her with the support to strengthen her business little by little.  This is why she is asking for her sixth loan; she needs to renovate her workspace (paint and expansion) and perform maintenance on her sewing machines' motors.  This will improve her work conditions and give her more space to facilitate her end-of-year output, as her demand increases.  She will also be able to fill her orders in a timely manner with excellently executed, quality garments.  This will generate more income for her household and pave the way to acquiring new contracts.  Berta wants to keep working hard to move forward with her income-generating business as she dreams of having a much bigger sewing workshop that will allow her to grow and offer job opportunities, especially to single mothers.  In this way, she will improve the quality of life of not only her family, but that of all the people who take part in this difficult, demanding work.

Pakistan. His wife is a very hardworking and responsible housewife who always helps her husband in the running of the shop. \n\nSince 2001, Sohail has been running school stationary shop and books stall which is the only source of income for his family. Currently he needs to purchase more books and stationary equipment for next year to continue his shop, but due to financial constraints he finds it difficult.

\u201cRefuge Group\u201d takes place each month in a neighborhood of Quetzaltenango in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. The nine ladies in the group chose this name because they consider the Trust Bank a place to learn, to share, to participate, and to seek support. The ladies are optimistic, enthusiastic, and beautiful in their colorful and traditional outfits that are representative of the area. The women have an average of 2.7 years of education, and their families average four children. The ladies are involved in various economic activities such as the sale of clothing, the weaving of typical regional costumes, and animal husbandry. One of the members has a small store.\r\n\r\nGladys is a 40-year-old married member of the group with four children who range in age from 8 to 19. They are her treasures and the \u201clight of her eyes\u201d. Like some families in the community, her family is involved with weaving of typical skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d. Currently, Gladys has four employees and because of their assistance, she is able to meet the demand for each week. She has applied for a new loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to buy a variety of good quality yarn. Gladys is very happy to have this working capital because she will have more material to work with and therefore, more income.\r\n\r\nThe nine women, along with their families, appreciate the opportunity to secure a loan which ultimately benefits everyone in their families since many of the businesses are family businesses. They also look forward to their monthly educational trainings on topics like sales and promotion, savings and indebtedness, medicinal plants, and healthy meals. Armed with their loans and information from their educational trainings, these women look forward to the future where empowered women will eliminate poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4725,"image":{"id":1455869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy a variety of good quality yarn to make clothes.

The women appreciate the generosity of Kiva investors. The ladies are truly honored that people from all parts of the world believe that the women of \u201cUkux Kem\u201d can progress with the proper tools. Because of the success of the previous loan cycle, the group is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge funded by Kiva investors.\n\nThe Ukux Kem Trust Bank is aptly named, as the ladies weave and sell textiles like tablecloths, napkins and traditional shirts or \u201chuipiles\u201d, as well as the traditional skirts or \u201ccortes\u201d.  Juana is a 59-year-old mother of five children and is widowed. She joined Friendship Bridge around five years ago. Juana was greatly relieved when she first found out that she was eligible for a loan, which she is using in her textile manufacturing business. \n\nShe will use the funds to produce more textiles such as the beautiful, traditional skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d, tablecloths and napkins. As the high-selling part of the year is approaching in November and December, Juana has requested a new loan, which she will use to purchase quality thread and yarn in bulk. She employs one of her children, and the pair work hard to make enough income to support the family. Juana makes delivery of her products at least twice per month. Because of her efforts, she is pleased to make her monthly loan payments on time and support her family.\n\nJuana, along with the other members of the Trust Bank, are actively involved in the monthly educational training programs offered by Friendship Bridge. It is essential that the loans that the women receive be combined with these trainings that cover topics like business administration and indebtedness, women\u2019s and children\u2019s nutrition and health, as well as self-esteem.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":1459780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Two years ago she managed to set up small premises where she sells paper, exercise books, pencils, rubbers, etc.  She runs her business in her local school which guarantees her a ready market for her goods.  Through a great deal of hard work she has managed to build a small brick house which is her main asset.  She wants to continue improving her family's living conditions and so she is applying to FUSAI for this loan to have an electricity supply installed (as she does not have one at present). She will also use it to buy bricks, cement and sand, as she also wants to build a retaining wall.  She very much hopes that this help will be

To assist her husband in earning a living for the family, Ann is engaged in breeding cattle, piglets, and hens and in the cultivation of alfalfa. She sells the agricultural products in the local market. As  life is getting more expensive day by day, Anna wants to expand her agribusiness a little bit to be able to cover her family's needs more effectively. A loan of 3,000 USD will be a great support to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling her to purchase apricot layers, to pay for the harvesting services, to pay for the workforce, to purchase alfalfa seeds, to buy some fertilizers, and to purchase three steers. The loan will help her sustain her agribusiness. Anna and her family members highly rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will be very thankful to them for their help in collecting the needed loan.

Her business is doing very well, bringing in a monthly income of 30,000 som (KGS).  More importantly, Zubeida loves her work.  In order to expand her business, Zubeida turned to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS) to purchase two new sewing machines and some fabrics.

She lives with her husband, three school-age children (son who is 17 years old and two daughters who are 15 and 8 years old) and her mother-in-law. Arevik's husband renovates TVs and is the only breadwinner of the family. To assist her husband in earning a living, Arevik is engaged in breeding livestock of piglets and hens as well as and in the cultivation of tomato, alfalfa, apple and grapes. She realizes that the agricultural products in the local market is an important source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nTo continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way and to prepare it for the winter, Arevik needs to make some financial investments.

Therefore, Pedro will have his work equipment in better condition, and he will continue working with the desire to achieve his great dream of having his own house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1467298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to perform maintenance on his mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T05:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.27,"local_amount":133.17,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":134.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472941},{"amount":50.15,"local_amount":138.32,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":140.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450391397},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":143.7,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":145.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067836},{"amount":56.31,"local_amount":155.36,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":157.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880750},{"amount":56.31,"local_amount":155.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":157.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479104267},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":163,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":165.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490799324},{"amount":60.79,"local_amount":167.71,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":169.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504222358},{"amount":129.23,"local_amount":356.49,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":360.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517510256},{"amount":212.76,"local_amount":586.92,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T09:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":594.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530787706}],"funded_date":"2013-11-13T22:11:44Z","paid_date":"2014-09-20T09:30:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Hedel","image":971490}},{"id":630671,"name":"Ashot","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ashot is an agronomist from Kapan city of the Syunik region.

For Zokirdjon, agriculture, that is, growing potatoes, carrots, and wheat is not only a source of income, but his passion as well. He loves to work in the field from daybreak until dark. He appreciates every square foot of his land and tells himself that \u201cthe land is my meal ticket \u2014 thank you!\u201d.

For that reason, Nazia has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan. On getting a profit, first of all, she will repay the loan amount to Kiva, and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is much too congested.

Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cChoosing a university is an important and even the main step that can influence on your life and future. That is as important as a choice of profession. So to love your future job you must not make a mistake not only with the choice of profession but also with the choice of a proper university. I have dreamed about enrolling AUCA and I am happy that my dream came true. Of course the first reason is education. Nowadays education is the main facility for attainment of all your aims and becoming successful person in the future. If earlier the strongest person was one who had a weapon, now it is brain and acquired knowledge. I think that AUCA has all resources to give opportunity to get such high knowledge to students who try to get it. There is a wonderful library at AUCA. There is everything necessary for students. Another reason of my choice is a pleasant atmosphere and contingent. When you enter AUCA you immediately feel friendly spirit and desire of students to study. Among all the departments I chose business administration. Business will be required job whole over the world. Among all the above-mentioned opportunities AUCA provides financial aid to all its students, which is a Kiva loan. I would also like to take an opportunity and apply for Kiva loan. It will give me a great chance to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":197.5,"image":{"id":1467925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He is 44 years old, he is married and is raising three children.  Rahmatullo and his wife are trying to improve their living conditions, but they have only a small income.  His wife is working as a seamstress.  Rahmatullo wishes to increase his working capital and to attract more clients.  Rahmatullo is asking for a loan of 2,000 dollars (USD) to purchase additional cattle.

Therefore from the past eight years, along with his electrician work, he also drives a taxi at night. \r\n\r\nBut currently he is not able to generate any income from the taxi, as its engine is not working properly and needs to be repaired. \r\n\r\nNoreen has requested a loan from KIVA partner, BRAC Pakistan, to get a loan to repair the engine of her husband's taxi. \r\n\r\nWith the profit, her

Elizabeth works hard with her children on a daily basis to get on in life, dividing the work up between them.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is now asking for help to buy manure, fertilizers and other supplies which will help to protect her pineapple plants from insects and other problems which can damage the crop.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to have a bigger pineapple plantation but also to grow coffee so she can give variety to her customers and everyone who consumes her produce so that she can generate more income which will eventually strengthen her household finances and the assets for her children and grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1467477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies to protect her pineapple crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":0.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042264},{"amount":1.03,"local_amount":20.5,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":20.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562417632},{"amount":1448.94,"local_amount":28978.83,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":29362.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579541390}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T02:40:23Z","paid_date":"2014-12-22T10:25:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":630817,"name":"Razia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Razia is a poor but hardworking woman.

At an early age, her parents taught her to work the land where they grew coffee, corn, and beans. She is the mother of four children who attend a local school. Florentina has garnered much experience in the 10 years she has been growing coffee along with her husband, as coffee grows well in the area where they live because the soil is fertile and the climate is good for this crop. She and her husband own the land they cultivate, thanks to the purchase they made from one of their customers a while ago. The land is a 10-minute walk away, and sometimes they bring an animal because they collect the coffee grains by themselves.\r\n\r\nShe has applied to the COMIXMUL cooperative for a loan to better care for their coffee crop by clearing, fertilizing, and doing other tasks that will yield a better harvest. She plans to expand her crop and cultivate 1500 new coffee plants. By purchasing supplies, she will also be able to ensure that the plants are well tended and protected.

She is married and her husband works as a bricklayer. They have just one 5-year-old son who lives with them and is currently at kindergarten.\r\n\r\nMartha earns a living as a domestic help. She says that ever since she was little she used to do jobs around the house and her mother sent her to do domestic work. Apart from her job as a domestic help, she has a corn mill which brings in extra income for the family. She is the only one in the family who does this work and this does not have fixed hours. To get to work she takes a 15 min bus ride to go the 3 km from her house, and her working hours are from 7am to 3pm. \r\n\r\nThe loan Martha is asking for is to set up a small poultry farm, since she has seen that this is a business which gives a good income. Specifically, she will buy 100 chickens and concentrated chicken feed. With this small project of producing fattened chickens she will be able to make more income for her family. The idea of a chicken farm is something which she and her husband have had for some time and at last having their own chicken farm has become a reality thanks to the loan.\r\n\r\nIn the future Martha wants to have a bigger farm and a larger chicken production and better employment for herself and her husband and to live comfortably in a decent place with their son. She wants her son to continue with his education so that in the future he can become a professional and go to university. She and her husband will achieve this with a great deal of hard work and commitment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1467479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy 100 chickens and concentrated chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T19:00:09Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Mirian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903358}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T20:16:01Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":630842,"name":"Masika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Masika is a married woman with seven children, five of whom are in school.

She taught me not only the skills to communicate, read and write in English, but also to be honest, kind and responsible. I decided to enter AUCA and am very happy to become part of it now. AUCA is the best university and has a high reputation in our country. \r\n\r\nMy mathematics background will give me an opportunity to be one of the best students, as the lyceum where I studied is one of the leading schools, and it produces students who are skilled in maths. Therefore I entered the Economics department.\r\n\r\nAmongst other opportunities, AUCA provides financial aid to all its students, through Kiva loans. I would also like to take the opportunity and apply for Kiva loan. It will give me a great ability to cover my tuition

positive and responsible 29 year-old man.  He is married and does not yet have children.  He lives with his wife in a small village.  The house where they live is small and not quite suited for a good living in it.  Dilmurod's wife is a homemaker; she is a very hardworking and caring wife.  Dilmurod works as a carpenter.  He takes orders and works at home.  Dilmurod earns a goods income from this business, but the income is only enough for food expenses.  But he has a dream.  Dilmurod wants to build a big house for his family because he will soon have children and will need more space for his family.  He needs money for this.  What he earns is not enough to allow him to build a new house.  This is why Dilmurod came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy construction materials for building a house.  Dilmurod and his wife hope very much for a positive result and thank Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1457518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Once he secures a loan, Charles will be able to get a water pump from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it.\n\nWith a water pump Charles plans to greatly expand his production to meet local demand and even begin to transport his crops to larger markets in Lusaka where he can fetch a higher price. He hopes to invest his new profits in animals and to pay school fees for his children.

In order to have a steady income to live on, Safiyamoh is engaged in a small business. She and her friends prepare and sell pirozhkis (savory filled pies) at the local market. To do this, she has a small counter, where she sells pirozhkis. The family has additional income from her son and husband, who are working together in Russia and every month as possible they send money to the family. \r\n\r\nSafiyamoh wants to make good repairs in her home and to complete building a big, comfortable kitchen. But for that, she needs money. Therefore, she turned to Arvand and desires to receive a loan to buy building materials for repairing her home. She decided to get a loan because the earned income from the business is not enough to cover all the costs. \r\n\r\nNow, Safiyamoh hopes for a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1457245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safiyamoh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":137},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":141.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":146.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":151.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":157.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":162.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":168.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":174.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":180.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":186.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":193.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":199.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.11,"local_amount":137,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":138.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550215},{"amount":30.13,"local_amount":141.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":143.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774439},{"amount":31.19,"local_amount":146.76,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":148.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673577},{"amount":32.28,"local_amount":151.89,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":154.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144367},{"amount":33.4,"local_amount":157.21,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":159.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960187},{"amount":34.58,"local_amount":162.71,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":164.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180947},{"amount":234.31,"local_amount":1102.64,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1118.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875546}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T16:06:42Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":630879,"name":"Enriqueta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enriqueta is 60 years old.

She lives with her family in Bac Ninh. Minh has a son and a daughter who are in secondary school. Her husband is a farmer who raises chickens to earn a living. Minh has been a farmer for 12 years. She earns about 3,000,000 VND per month. Her family\u2019s total income is about 6,000,000 VND per month. Her challenges are lacking the capital to grow enough vegetables and not having enough money to pay for her children\u2019s education. Her dreams are to buy more equipment for her house and that her children will be successful in life. This loan is one of steps to help her fulfill her dreams. Minh is a hard-working and careful woman who is passionate about her job. She says that her job helps her to earn more money to pay for her living expenses while giving her more time to take care of her family. She has participated in SEDA's credit program since 2007. In the last loan cycle, she borrowed 10,528,000 VND and repaid the loan on time. In this cycle, she would like to borrow 11,424,000 VND to grow vegetables. Minh is always looking to expand her business, save profits for her children\u2019s education, and improve her family's future.

She lives with her husband and mother. With the help of her family members, she is engaged in breeding livestock of cows and pigs, and in cultivation of grass. Her husband realizes income from the agricultural products in the local market. This is the main source of the family's income.\r\n\r\nAs life is getting more expensive day by day, Ruzanna wants to expand her agribusiness to be able to make ends meet. A loan of USD 1000 will be a great support to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling her to purchase pigs. As this is Ruzanna\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. Ruzanna and her family highly rely on the good will of the lenders and will appreciate their support in collecting the needed amount for the loan to maintain and develop their agribusiness.
