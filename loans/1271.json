 It is difficult to get employment in the village and this is why he develops his own business.  He built large greenhouses and plants two harvests of cucumbers.  The provision for the family for the entire year depends on the invested labor.  Knowing this, Valeriy wants to purchase more land because it is known that the land feeds.  And now, unexpectedly, his parents decided to give their son their land plot because they can no longer work on it.  Valeriy became very happy that an opportunity to expand his business presented itself and will build two large greenhouses.  He did not have enough money for this and this is why he decided to obtain a business loan.  He had previously used loans from Kiva and knew where to request a loan.  He likes the convenient repayment schedule, where the main repayments can be made at the end of the loan, after gathering the harvest.  Valeriy's family will already be enjoying the new greenhouses at the end of this autumn because now their financial well being will significantly

He says that he will buy corn crop since it is cheaper and he can save it for later use. During the harvest, only the grass remains. That is why he also wants to buy a calf so that he can feed it the grass. So, the money put away for the calf will help him get more animals a little at a time.  His need will be met if he can buy the  corn at a cheaper price right now.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have a close-knit family, that his family doesn't go without, to prepare his kids for school, and also teach them a trade so that they can support themselves. He expresses that the loan will help him a lot because in his country, without a loan, there's not much one can do.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1467506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009608}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T20:58:34Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:27:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Marske","image":null}},{"id":630628,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 es un campesino de 51 a\u00f1os de edad que, durante su vida productiva se ha dedicado a la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda pero, por las dificultades que se presentaban con estas actividades, decidi\u00f3 cambiar su labor por la floricultura y hoy en d\u00eda posee cultivos con 22.000 matas de hortensias, cuenta con el apoyo de 6 empleados directos entre operarios y maquilladoras, algunos de ellos son miembros de su familia; las flores son cosechadas y vendidas a diferentes comercializadoras internacionales, de esta manera genera los recursos suficientes para llevar el sustento a su hogar, conformado por su esposa y sus dos hijos.

He is from \u200b\u200bSarband. Mirojidin grew up in a large and happy family. He lives with his wife, parents, brothers, and sisters. Mirojidin is the oldest child in the family, and he helps his father support his family. Mirojidin has about five years experience buying and selling cattle. In the beginning, he had a hard time taking care of the cows and bulls, but now he takes great care of the animals. Mirojidin decided to increase the number of livestock he has in his barnyard, thereby expanding his small business. He is asking for a loan to buy steers and calves to fatten and sell. We hope that Mirojidin receives funding from Kiva lenders so his work will flourish.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1466894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Kamenka Dnieper. He served in Afghanistan, then married and started in his favorite business growing tomatoes and cucumbers. He is experienced in this business, knows how to care for plants and to date has developed quite a large farm. He has five large greenhouses. To develop such a farm he had the help of previous business development loans.\r\n\r\nDespite the experience of Alexei's greenhouse business, this year it has failed. Alexei planted a second harvest of cucumbers and the plants were well developed, looked good, and had no signs of trouble. Suddenly, in September, the cold came and there was even frost on the ground, and because of all this the plants died. Alexei suffered a loss, but he did not despair because he knew that he could count on help in the form of a loan with favorable conditions. Alexei is asking for a loan for the amout of 30,000 Hryvnia to buy seeds, fertilizer, and film to make the planting again for the spring season. He believes that this is a temporary difficulty and next year will make every effort to grow a good

With these items she can give her business a better image and she will have the opportunity to stock up on all the products that sell well.  In addition, Sara will be able to satisfy demand, which increases at the end of the year.  This will allow Sara to earn higher profits, which will benefit the household economy.

Lilian is currently requesting a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative to buy fertilizer, liquid plant food, coffee formula, etc. to take care of their coffee crops because the family's finances depend on agriculture. It is essential for them to have a good harvest at the end of the season. \r\n\r\nHer future plans are to be able to improve her coffee crops, growing a better variety, and to be able to strengthen the heritage for her children. Her dreams are to be able to give her children a good future and a good education because that is the best legacy that she could hand down - that they are successful in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1467472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies in order to care for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.42,"local_amount":568.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":575.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812950},{"amount":471.58,"local_amount":9431.67,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-28T10:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":9556.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579541555}],"funded_date":"2013-11-13T19:32:20Z","paid_date":"2014-12-28T10:17:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":631613,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Teresa de 47 anos de idade, tem cinco filhos, dos quais tr\u00eas v\u00e3o \u00e0 Escola e os dois encontram-se fora do pais.

When she was 15 she became involved in the field of making clothes.  She took some training courses, and when she got married she set up her own shop.  She set it up in the rented house that she lives in with her husband and their two children.\r\n\r\nIn time, she specialized in high fashion dressmaking.  She works alone every day.  This way she generates enough resources to help her husband with the responsibility of the household finances.  Her drive, strength, and dedication have allowed her to strengthen her business.  She is now well-known in the area where she lives because of her track record and the excellent quality of her work.\r\n\r\nThe reason she is requesting the loan is to buy an overlock sewing machine.  The one that she has is several years old, and it constantly breaks down.  With the new machine she will be able to streamline her production process, and her working conditions will improve.  She will not lose time or supplies, and she will be able to get new customers.  For her this will mean getting better income to contribute to the household finances.\r\n\r\nLuz is excited about the idea of knowing that she has another opportunity to fulfill her dream of getting her own house and continuing with her workshop.  This will bring about the possibility of enjoying a better quality of life with her husband and their children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1467793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a woman who knows how to overcome adversity: with a lot of hard work and dedication, she has been able to get her family ahead.  About 15 years ago, she started working in on-contract sewing, work which she learned from a family member.  She has the help of one employee and another person who works with her on a day by day basis. She works every day from 7:00 am until 9:00 pm from the comfort of her home. Not paying rent for a shop helps her get more out of what she charges for her services.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is currently requesting will help her finish paying off the balance on the last two sewing machines that she bought. This will help her feel more at ease and enable her to keep working to finish her pending projects. These will bring in the income she needs to continue providing for her family. Elicenia wants to expand her business and provide more employment opportunities for young people. She hopes to improve not only her own family's quality of life, but also that of the other people that she touches in this difficult line of work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1467609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"pay the remaining balance on two recent sewing machines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-13T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-12T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elicenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":71391},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":73368},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75400},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":77488},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79633},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":81839},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":86434},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":88827},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91287},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93815},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":96413}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.48,"local_amount":71392,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":72450.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074820},{"amount":38.52,"local_amount":73372,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":74459.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010026},{"amount":80.26,"local_amount":152883,"processed_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":155149.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523650},{"amount":41.93,"local_amount":79874,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81058.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227345},{"amount":42.99,"local_amount":81892,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83106.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480244991},{"amount":45.22,"local_amount":86127,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":87403.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855747},{"amount":45.69,"local_amount":87034,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":88324.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282504},{"amount":47.12,"local_amount":89756,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91086.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520982863},{"amount":49.54,"local_amount":94364,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":95762.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531789599},{"amount":96.25,"local_amount":183306,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":186023.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542541139}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T07:20:37Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T14:15:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":630977,"name":"Riffat Parveen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riffat, a 37-year-old hard-working woman, lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her husband, one daughter and two sons.

She lives with her husband and son. She works in the government sector, and her husband works in a private copper-molybdenum factory. Both of them pit their efforts together to be able to earn a living. Their salaries alone, however, are not enough to cover the family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nApart from her main job, Lilik, with the help of her family members, is engaged in beekeeping and in cultivation of several fruits (peach, cherry, quince, pomogranate, fig, grapes, apple, and walnut). They realize the agricultural products in the local market, which is an important source of family's income. \r\n\r\nTo make her beekeeping business sustainable and more productive, Lilik needs to make some financial investments. She needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase several new beehives and buy wax for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nAs this is Lilik\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF.

He is conscientious that he works in a competitive area and he knows that the value he can offer his customers is to have a well-stocked store in order to meet their needs and requirements.

This will be very useful and help him with his business, which is very profitable.

The group consists of four ladies who live together in Sana'a, Yemen. The group took a loan of 230,000 YER. Safa is 30 years old. She is a married woman and has two children. She has been working in the embroidery business for five years. She started her business as a hobby at her home where she embroidered at her leisure.

I would like to run my own business, which is a swimming pool with hot tubs that is open throughout the year, and that is affordable to everyone. This is how people can care about their health. So, studying at AUCA is a great opportunity for me to realize all of my plans for the future, to put Kyrgyzstan is a global dimension so that more and more international companies are interested in investing in my country. AUCA is going to open the doors to the whole world for me and I am very excited to study here. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to all its students, and even gives financial assistant to all of them.

The ones I like the most are anatomy and physiology as I could learn the functions of the human body. \n\nI have decided to request a KIVA-FUNDAPEC loan as my parents are of modest income and cannot pay my education. If I am not approved for this loan I will have to abandon my studies as I can't fund them. Nor can my parents as what they earn is not sufficient for the household expenses and my education. This would alter my life radically as I wouldn't fulfill my dream of becoming a doctor.\n\nMy goal is to graduate with high marks and to serve all those who need it, to serve my country and my community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1468325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She and her husband are raising three children.  She has a specialized secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business a year ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Venera's hard work, her farming business now comprises one dairy cow and one calf.  She also owns 0.7 hectare (1.72 acre) of land on which she grows peppers and corn annually.  She makes a monthly income of 12,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Venera has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to buy some cows for breeding. \r\n\r\nShe plans to re-invest some of her profits back into her business by purchasing additional livestock. She is also planning to save enough money to continue to finance her children's education.

Janyl has a high school education, and to earn her family's sole source of income she farms and raises animals. She started 19 years ago with the purchase of animals for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work, Janyl now owns three dairy cows and 1.20 hectares of arable land on which she grows beans, peppers, and clover each year. Her monthly income is 9,000 som (KGS).

She and her husband are raising four children. She has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business 15 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Mairamgul's hard work, her farming business now comprises five dairy cows.  She also owns 0.3 hectare (0.74 acre) of land on which she grows potatoes, corn and alfalfa.  She makes a monthly income of 7,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Mairamgul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 120,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to buy some cows which she will fatten and then resell at a higher price at the market. \r\n\r\nShe plans to re-invest her profits from this loan back into her business by purchasing additional livestock. She is also planning to save enough money to build a new barn for her livestock.

Together they have 3 children who live with them in their house, which is made of noble materials. Santa owns a hectare and a half of farming land which she bought when she was very young. This is where she works to maintain her cultivated fields in good shape. This allows her to obtain a high quality product which she sells at a good price in her local markets. She started working as a farmer due to her parents initiative, they supported her since she was a child in the various agricultural tasks which are a part of this trade. \r\n\r\nSanta uses only organic fertilizer in order to obtain an optimal growth in her fields, which are very fertile. Nonetheless, this also encourages the growth of weeds which she must remove constantly with the help of workers who she pays ahead of time. When harvesting time comes around she hires support employees in order to pick up the ripe fruits and to air dry them.

The latter is the main source of their income. As the autumn is progressing and winter is very close, Julieta needs to make some investments in her agribusiness to prepare it for the winter. She needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase forage for the livestock (alfalfa, barley, and combined forage). The loan will help her run the agribusiness in a sustainable way. As this is Julieta\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history.

old, married and she and her husband are raising 3 children. Patma has high school education. Patma provides her family's main source of income by growing crops and breeding livestock, which she started doing 20 years ago with 10,000 Kyrgyz som. Thanks to her hard work, Patma currently has 1 milking cow, 1 horse and 0.26 hectares of land. She uses the land every day to grow potatoes, corn and to sow crops to both sell and use herself. Her monthly income is 5,000 som. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her farm, Patma contacted the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners to ask for a loan of 30,000 som, in order to buy fertilizer and pesticides to help her work on her cultivated land. She also wants to use the money to buy potato seeds. Patma plans to use the profits from the loan to buy more livestock and plans to save enough funds to refurbish her animals' living areas.

With the help of her family members, Khanum is engaged in cattle breeding, in breeding pigs and hens, and in cultivation of apricots. They realize the agricultural products in the local market, which is an important source of income. To continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Khanum needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase five steers and to buy some forage for the livestock, preparing it for the winter. As this is Khanum\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history.

She learned it well and liked it, and decided to set up a small workshop in her home to make costume jewelry (earrings, bracelets, rings and necklaces) and embroidered regional costumes.  What she enjoys most about her work is that she can be creative to come up with different styles of earrings, bracelets, rings and necklaces that her customers will like.  She works on the jewelry at home but in the afternoon goes to friends' and neighbors' houses to sell her products.  Sometimes she receives orders for custom designs.  Martha says she earns more from the regional costumes because by selling one she can make the same amount of money as she does with one month's sale of jewelry.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan through VisionFund to buy threads, fabrics, rhinestones and a punch press to continue with her craft work.

As autumn is progressing, Naira needs to prepare her agribusiness for the winter. She needs a loan of 1500 USD to buy forage for her cattle. She has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to her hard work during in recent times, Naira was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. Therefore, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

She decided on this business because food always sells and she likes to cook.\r\n\r\nMartha hopes this loan helps her buy masa, oil, beans, tortillas, cream, cheese, lettuce, chicken and beef, chili peppers, potatoes, onion, tomatoes, and garlic so she can continue selling. \r\n\r\nMartha would like to continue making progress with her business in the future so her children will keep on going to school.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Ana Guadalupe, who sells groceries; Clarissa, who sells snacks; and Nicol\u00e1s, who raises pigs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1461524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Progreso, Tierra Blanca, Ver.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-13T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-12T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clarissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3645.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644512},{"amount":185,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-04T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877973},{"amount":185,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449767003},{"amount":185,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247804},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1215.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072862}],"funded_date":"2013-11-15T20:10:58Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":631161,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia tiene 35 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada con Marcelino de 42 a\u00f1os y tiene 3 hijos.

He is proud to have provided for his children until they were adults, apart from his young daughter Sulma who is 11 years old and lives with him and his wife in their adobe house. As a farmer he is well known in the area for the work he does and because he has lived in the community for many years. He grew up with agriculture from a very young age alongside his parents, since it was the main source of income from his grandparents. He has more than 50 years' experience in this work and has always had the support of his wife with whom he has worked and dedicated his life to the wellbeing of his family.

He lives with his family in a house made out of wood. \n\nSince he was very young he learned the various activities that his parents carried out to support the family such as growing organic cocoa and other products typical to this area. With the passing of the years this motivated him to use what he had learned as a commercial enterprise. Thanks to his parents and as a reward for the years of disinterested work, he inherited a small plot of land, one hectare in size. On it he started to grow organic cocoa. Later he acquired more land to expand his workings.

Its main source of employment is retail.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe is one of the members of this group. She is 49 years old, completed secondary school, and is married to Enrique. She says she has run a small grocery store from her home for over fifteen years, and that she started her business because she wanted to make some extra money without neglecting her family. Since there were no grocery stores in her neighborhood, she thought it would be a good investment.\r\n\r\nWhat Guadalupe likes the most about her business is that she is always in contact with people and always manages to make sales. Her business is open daily from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm and she would like to get a loan from Kiva and VisionFund because it would help her invest in purchasing rice, beans, oil, flour, soft drinks, cookies, soap, cold cuts, and canned goods.\r\n\r\nShe expects her business to prosper from this investment and that it will be visibly more well-stocked in order to attract more customers, increase her earnings, and improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Nelida and Anabel, who both sell cosmetics;

Sonia has a full primary education thanks to her parents' support, but she was unable to continue studying as her parents had few financial resources and didn't have enough means to continue supporting her. \r\n\r\nFrom a very young age Sonia has been making her living in agriculture as this profession is a tradition in her family and is the source of income for her family. Her father took her to the fields where he worked and he showed how her to harvest the coffee. Later on he taught her how to grow bulk grains (rice, corn and beans). Together with her husband, they make their living in agriculture, growing coffee, sowing corn and beans. They have their own land which is near their home which is why from day to day they work tirelessly and yet with a huge amount of enthusiasm to tend and weed their crops with the strong belief that they will obtain an excellent harvest as this is the area in which they generate the most income.\r\n\r\nThis is why at the moment Sonia finds herself in need of money to buy agricultural supplies to technically support her coffee crops such as the purchase of fertilizers, fungicides and so on which will help them to keep the crops healthy and safe from plagues among others. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams of increasing her crops; sowing and cultivating a larger amount of coffee plants and in this way obtaining a greater income that will help her get ahead with her family and give her children a better opportunity in life: educating them so that in the future they become people that are prepared and with a vision who look after the inheritance which she and her husband want to leave them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1468378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies to tend to her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-13T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-12T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Antonieta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2.56,"local_amount":52.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710616},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":0.29,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":0.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449616575},{"amount":3.57,"local_amount":72.71,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":72.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082680},{"amount":278.86,"local_amount":5675,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5697.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895350},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":1012.2,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490813055},{"amount":154.18,"local_amount":3137.61,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3149.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517523825},{"amount":81.08,"local_amount":1649.99,"processed_date":"2014-09-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1656.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530535754},{"amount":855,"local_amount":17400,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":17467.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542499211}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T22:25:21Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:24:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":631367,"name":"Bakbergen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bakbergen is a first-year student at  AUCA (American University of Central Asia), department of Business Administration. Here is his story.\r\n\r\n\"Last year I was a student at International Ataturk Ala-Too University. I applied to three universities last year and was been accepted by all of them, but because of the financial limitations of my family,  I decided to study at Ataturk Ala-Too University.  This year I decided to reapply to AUCA, as I did last year (although I could not attend AUCA last year). This year I have been accepted by AUCA. \r\n\r\nAUCA gives students a chance to apply for exchange programs or the MBA program. Students of AUCA are highly qualified and it is an honor for me to become part of it now. The quality of education is very high, so the teachers are highly qualified, accordingly. Students of AUCA are from different parts of the world and form one culture at AUCA. There is a fantastic atmosphere at AUCA. AUCA is recognized for its outstanding educational system and many programs that are ranked highly across the nation. This is a university that always expands and every time becomes more advanced for its students. Knowing that the staff cares about its students, as exemplified through their persistent and constant up-grading of the school, highly influenced my decision to apply to this university. \r\n\r\nAUCA will become my home for the next four years, and the diverse cultures and comforting atmosphere of the university are things I would be proud to associate myself with. While going on tours throughout high schools, AUCA has been the one that drew me in the most. This university offers me many different opportunities and resources that other schools could not. Another opportunity that AUCA gives to every student is a Kiva loan. It is what can make dreams come true. I am applying for the loan as I have financial difficulties and am not able to cover my tuition fees fully.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1468682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Her husband could not find steady employment at home so he left the country and is now a migrant worker in the Russian Federation. Shiringul started a business 14 years ago because she needed the money to provide for her children. She has a shop in the market where she buys and sells fabrics. She is successful because she knows how to take an individual approach for each of her customers. Because she is the main source of income for her family she isn't able to save any money for home repairs. She has asked for a loan of 4000 somoni in order to buy building materials such as paint, wood, and such.

Con el fin de asegurar su vivienda ha decidido enrejar el corredor  para lo cual necesita comprar hierro y pago de mano obra para hacer el enrejado.

Mirian is enterprising and very responsible.  She has made a living selling beauty products from catalogues for five years, and this supports her household.  In order to make her house more secure, Mirian has decided to build a fence around the passage outside and, for this, needs to buy iron and pay labourers to build the fence.  Mirian is applying to FUSAI for the money that she needs, as she does not have enough cash available.  However, with the loan, which she can pay back monthly, she can build this fence.\r\n\r\n\r\n

Nurlan has secondary education. As a main source of income for his family, Nurlan works with livestock breeding, after having started 10 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nurlan's persistent work, his farm currently has seven dairy cows, 56 sheep, two horses and also a plot of land of 2.0 hectares. Here he grows beans, potatoes and perennial grasses. The monthly income is 20,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nNurlan is a member of the group \"Kelechek-Kalba\". This group also has two other members. Nurlan is the second member of this group. With an aim to further develop his business, Nurlan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 90,000 som (KGS) to purchase bull-calves to increase the number of livestock. Nurlan plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals, and plans to save money for building a new house.

husband. Bayan has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Bayan works with livestock breeding, after having started 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 8,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bayan's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow, one calf and 20 sheep, and also a plot of land of 2.50 hectares. Here she grows beans, potatoes and perennial grasses. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nBayan is a member of the group \"Kelechek-Kalba\". There are two other people in this group, and as a result there are three of them. Bayan is the leader of this group. With an aim to further develop her business, Bayan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep to increase the number of livestock. Bayan plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals, and plans to save money for repairing her house.

Instead, Angelina worked in the field and looked after animals, such as hens, pigs, and cows.  Angelina is now married and, with her husband, works in agriculture. She is a mother to six children - two are in school and two work in farming with their parents.  The other two travelled to the US four years ago and send home a little money whenever they can.  Angelina's father now also now depends on his daughter.\r\n\r\nAngelina makes a living looking after pigs, and now has 25 years experience doing this work.  She learned it from her parents, who were very poor.  They did this work for a very long time and it, with farming, was their income.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy four small pigs, each of which will cost $50.

She works every day for approximately ten hours.  She believes that it is going well for her because of her dedication and her good performance.\r\n\r\nRosa is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the help provided, she will make improvements to her house.  She wishes to improve the walls, put in the floor, and refurbish the roof on her house.  This way she will continue working and putting forth great effort in order to achieve her big dream of becoming a professional.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1468457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She has been a farmer for many years, specializing in dairy farming. She also has a small piece of land where she grows vegetables and cereals like maize, beans and peas for their food needs,  and she gets milk from her five cows. This income is used to cater for the family needs  and pay the children's school fees. \r\n\r\nLucy, like other women in the county, has faced a lot of challenge when in comes to accessing fuel for cooking and lighting. She has to walk a long distance every weekend  to collect firewood  enough for the week and buy kerosene for lighting. After an encounter with a VEP marketing team at a farmers field day, Lucy learnt that she had a better source of fuel that was cleaner, cheaper and more convenient. She learnt that she could enjoy biogas fuel for cooking and lighting from the animals dung. To facilitate construction of the biodigester, VEP could advance her an affordable credit to be repaid in 24 months.\r\n\r\nWith the biogas Lucy will enjoy cooking in a cleaner kitchen without smoke. Her pots will not get dirty with soot, and she will not tire herself out with collecting firewood anymore. She will also replace her kerosene lantern with the biogas lamp that is brighter and save money spent on purchasing kerosene. This money can be saved for future needs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1126.13,"image":{"id":1468776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal
