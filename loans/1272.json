Salvadora lives in the La Palma region, in a hamlet 10 km from the town of El Sauce, where the local population mostly works in livestock farming and agriculture. \r\n\r\nAs well as farming with her husband, Mar\u00eda Salvadora also works as a vendor, selling new clothing for both women and men. She began this business 34 years ago with capital given to her by her husband, in order to generate her own income. It was with these earnings that she helped her son to train as a lawyer, and he is now independent.\r\n\r\nShe is a remarkable woman, as despite her age she works hard day after day to take home the daily bread. She gets up at four o'clock in the morning to carry out her household chores, and she leaves very early to go to the town of Achuapa or El Sauce, where she traverses the streets offering her products for sale.\r\n\r\nWith the Christmas season coming up, including many celebrations that are often held in December such as promotions, weddings and quince a\u00f1os [fifteenth birthday parties], people want new clothes. At the moment Mar\u00eda Salvadora has many orders, but she does not have much capital available. For this reason she is seeking a credit from CEPRODEL, with funds from Kiva, which she will use to buy underwear, women's pants, skirts and blouses, and men's shirts and pants.\r\n\r\nShe hopes and trusts in God that people with good hearts will support her loan, and she will be able to make her investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1468450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He lives with his wife at a sector in Jordan called Southern Ghour. \r\n\r\nAmer has been selling hot drinks for a year and a half.

Now with the new advice she obtained, Mary's poultry business is improving. She works from 8:00am to 5:00pm each working day and is able to make a good profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mary's tenth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used her previous loans to improve her tailoring business by paying her landlord in advance to expand the premises. Mary also managed to buy two new tailoring machines and was able to pay her business rent without difficulties. Mary has successfully paid back all her previous loans. She used her profits to cover school fees and household expenses and reinvested back in her business. Mary will use this loan to buy more tailoring materials and pay rent for her place of business. Her dream is to open another branch at home so she can receive more orders. \r\n\r\nMary will share this loan with her loan group, Kilombero, which consists of two members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

Anarjan has a higher education and works as a chief specialist at the economic development fund. To provide additional income for her family, Anarjan is involved in animal husbandry, having started 18 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Anarjan's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 2 calves, 2 bulls, 15 sheep and also a 0.50 hectare land plot, where she grows clover, potatoes and corn. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). Anarjan is part of the \"Tash-Tobo\" group that includes two more persons.

Thanks to Venera's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 3 horses, 10 sheep and also a 0.50 hectare land plot, where she grows beans, potatoes and clover. The monthly income amounts to 8,000 som (KGS). Venera is part of the \"Tash-Tobo\" group that includes two more persons. Venera is the second member of the group. In order to further develop her business, Venera requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy 1 cow and 10 sheep to increase livestock headcount.

She has a secondary education and raises animals as the primary source of her family's income, a business she started 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now contains two milk cows, one bull, 40 sheep, one horse and two calves as well as 3.5 hectares of arable land, on which she grows beans, potatoes and hay, with a total monthly income of 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nBegaiym belongs to the group \"Kelechek-Kalba\", along with two other people. With the intention of further developing her farm, she has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 90,000 KGS to purchase heifers to increase her head count. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further augmentation of her quantity of cattle, and plans to save toward building a house for her middle son.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1468202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy heifers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kalba village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":152.93,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Begaiym","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1161,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":60794.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":89,"payment_id":579488635},{"amount":181.04,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10132.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.29,"payment_id":624798762},{"amount":380.03,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20264.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":36.64,"payment_id":649513443}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T22:24:01Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":631486,"name":"Aysha's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aysha is a 40-year-old married woman.

She has the equivalent of a high school education, and raises livestock for a living, first starting 20 years ago with 10,000 som worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, her farm currently has 2 dairy cows, 1 heifer, 30 sheep, 3 horses, and 2 calves, while her monthly income is 6,000 som.  Rapiysa, along with 2 other people, is forming a group called Kyzyl-Gul with her as the leader.

For this new loan, she wants the Kiva loan to buy fertilizers during maize production; she needs to buy more fertilizer in order to increase their production. With profits from her farming he wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

After returning home after work, her neighbours came to her asking for certain leftover foodstuffs which she brought back with her. Finally, this is when the idea came to her to set up a stall in front of her house and to sell the same produce. This way, she would be able to win over all the customers in the local area.

She has secondary education and does animal husbandry as a main source of income for her family, which she started five years ago with the purchase of livestock for 12,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Jypariza now has in her livestock one milk cow, fifteen sheep and also a plot of land in the size of 0.96 hectares where she grows beans and potatoes.

She and her husband have a lot of experience in this job because they have learned to work together as one for the business.\r\n\r\nShe walks three kilometers every day to take care of her crops.  Her family is the main motivation for her income and her area is coffee.  Her parents taught her to farm and gave her the land that she and her husband now farm.  The two of them alone do the various tasks.\r\n\r\nThis is why Ricarda currently needs a loan to buy one liter of Alto SL and two bags each of foliar soil amendments, urea, 18-46-0 soil amendments, Nutricaf\u00e9, coffee formula, and 12-24-12 soil amendments.  With these products she'll be able to take care of her coffee plants for the season.\r\n\r\nRicarda dreams of expanding her coffee crop and giving her children better living conditions in the future.  She had a lot of limitations during her childhood and doesn't want them to be in the same situation.  She also wants them to have a college education so they'll be professionals and have a better future.  She trusts her children will help her financially in her old age.\r\n\r\nRicarda believes she'll realize these goals by improving her land to get excellent harvests and, consequently, generate the additional income that her household needs so much.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1468498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T13:30:08Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricarda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10215,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579541394}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T23:45:35Z","paid_date":"2014-12-22T10:25:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":631269,"name":"Maria Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Luisa,soltera originaria del municipio de chinandega ubicado en el occidente del pa\u00eds, donde predomina el comercio, turismo, sus hermosas playas entre otras mas bellezas, se caracteriza por ser una mujer responsable, trabajadora que no le teme al trabajo, se dedica a la compra venta de mercader\u00eda en general como: ropa interior, cosm\u00e9ticos, zapatos, chineria, prendas de oro, y otros por encargos, ella realiza sus compras en otros municipios, los cuales son al contado, ella distribuye su mercader\u00eda a comerciantes de distintos municipios del pa\u00eds principalmente de occidente, los cuales tiene clientes fijos y eventuales, este negocio ya son varios a\u00f1os de tenerlo, el cual lo inicia como un medio de subsistencia para salir adelante, uno de sus sue\u00f1os es poder incrementar mas su negocio y as\u00ed lograr salir adelante, al igual que poder comprar su propia casa. el objetivo de este cr\u00e9dito es para capital de trabajo, en la compra de mercader\u00eda como: zapatos, diferentes estilo de ropa, cosm\u00e9ticos, entre otros por lo que su demanda creci\u00f3 mas y por la proximidad de las fechas navide\u00f1as.-","en":"Maria Luisa is single and from the municipality of Chinandega in the west of the country.

She is 25 years old, single and has no children. She finished high school, reaching a basic level of education. She still lives with her parents and siblings.\r\n\r\nSonia works in agriculture, which is a tradition in her family. She specializes in growing coffee and building greenhouses and has been doing so for more than ten years. Her clients are neighbors and friends, middle men, etc. Her coffee plantations are located five km [around three miles] from where she lives, so she, her siblings and her parents take a bus and work together growing coffee.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her plantations in the future in order to produce more and receive a higher income to get ahead with her family. However, her biggest dream is to continue studying and make it to the university, so she can have a professional carrier. This way, she could apply her knowledge doing what she does best and would be able to bring the best practices and the newest techniques and strategies to continue growing.\r\n\r\nFor this, she needs a loan to buy agricultural supplies in order to take care of her coffee plantations. She will buy compost, fertilizers, foliar spray, urea and other supplies she needs. With the profits she will make, she will take the first step towards the fulfillment of her biggest dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1468510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her coffee plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T14:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T14:10:09Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1225,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":25026.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579541395}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T09:53:52Z","paid_date":"2014-12-22T10:25:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":631512,"name":"Caroline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Caroline is a  Kiva borrower.

He lives with his 53-year-old mother, who is housekeeper. He has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Seiran was unable to study for a professional career. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing different kinds of vegetables and walnut trees. Harvested vegetables are used in the family and walnuts are sold to local retailers. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Seiran decided to start own business and sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempt was unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 3,000 GEL [Georgia lari] to start trading fruits and vegetables. Seiran will purchase stock of fruits and vegetables and resell at a higher price to generate income. He is very motivated to be involved in his own business and help his mother to cover everyday

He lives with his brother and parents. His mother is provided with a retirement pension of 150 GEL per month. Despite having a high education Mirian is unemployed. In the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. The family has two cows and two calves and produces cheese to sell. The income is not enough for the family and Mirian decided to start a trading business with the loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Mirian's credit requests were rejected several times, as he was unable to satisfy their requirements. He received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and the Credo Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of 2400 GEL to begin to trade fruits and vegetables, he will purchase fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices and then resell at higher price to generate income.

After they learned about solar power that could be used for lighting and charging mobile phones, they decided to use it. This will save them money as they no longer have to buy candles and kerosene or pay to charge their mobile phones. This technology will also improve their lives by saving time and their health.\r\n \r\nTeresia, the group Secretary (on the left-side squatting), has suffered the effects of using kerosene. The smoke she has inhaled for years from the traditional open lantern has affected her lungs and eyes. Her eyes have turned red with irritation and she is constantly coughing from the smoke effect. Six years ago she also lost her neighbour through a fire accident in her home.  This experience has helped her appreciate the benefits of solar power and she acts as a promoter of this technology in the community.\r\n\r\nThe group applied for a loan to purchase solar home packages that would enable them to light at least 4 rooms, charge a mobile phone and use a small radio. They will no longer need to buy kerosene. The amount saved will be used as savings as well as to repay the loan. Together the group members will also spread the good gospel of using solar and transform their dark village into a bright one.

","en":"Carolina is a 23-years old woman who lives in the city of Nazca with her partner and her young son. She is hardworking, enthusiastic, and she is putting all her effort in to get ahead. Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources and because she has to work, Carolina can't pursue a professional career.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, Carolina works selling beauty products. She works every day for about 10 hours walking the streets to sell her products. Carolina is comfortable doing her work and she thinks that it is going well for her as a result of her dedication and effort.\r\n\r\nCarolina is very grateful for Kiva lenders. Thanks to the assistance provided, she will carry out the process to improve the bathroom in her home. This will allow her and her family to have more comfort. Carolina will keep working and striving to achieve her big dream to have safe and adequate housing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1468554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to improve the bathroom in her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T17:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T17:50:08Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":135.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":144.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":148.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":157.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":158.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":164.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":168.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":174.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":178.71},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":184.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":190.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":195.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.24,"local_amount":135.83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":137.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695399},{"amount":52.21,"local_amount":144.04,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":146.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450391418},{"amount":53.84,"local_amount":148.52,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459067856},{"amount":57.25,"local_amount":157.93,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":160.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880769},{"amount":57.29,"local_amount":158.04,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-19T09:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":160.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479104285},{"amount":59.54,"local_amount":164.24,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":166.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490799340},{"amount":124.08,"local_amount":342.29,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":347.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504222369},{"amount":64.78,"local_amount":178.71,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T09:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":181.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530787714},{"amount":206.77,"local_amount":570.4,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":579.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542484479}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T15:45:00Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:04:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Marske","image":null}},{"id":631590,"name":"Kwekwe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kwekwe is a hardworking and enterprising woman.

Murad works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize.  In addition he owns a vineyard and produce wine.  He always has high quality products, which is sold to local retailers for a good price.   As the family has only seasonal income, Murad decided to start a family business and to seek credit from some local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor income. \r\n\r\nThe startup program, that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.  His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1,000 GEL for purchasing building materials to build a greenhouse.  He has already started building, but needs some materials to cover the greenhouse.

old, married and raising three children together with her husband. Arzikan has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide additional income for her family, Arzikan is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 15 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Arzikan's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 20 sheep and also a 2.25 hectare land plot, where she grows beans and potatoes. The monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS). Arzikan is part of the \"Han-Burgo\" group that includes two more persons. All together there are three of them in the group.  Arzikan is the leader of the group. In order to further develop her business, Arzikan requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls to increase livestock headcount. Arzikan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to repair her

husband. Alyi has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Alyi is involved in animal husbandry, having started 30 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Alyi's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 1 horse, 1 calf and also a 1.75 hectare land plot, where she grows beans, potatoes and perennial herbs. The monthly income amounts to 11,000 som (KGS). Alyi is part of the \"Han-Burgo\" group that includes two more persons. Alyi is the second member of the group. In order to further develop her business, Alyi requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep to increase livestock headcount. Alyi plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a new house for her youngest

Marine's husband,Teimuraz, works as a cook at a restaurant in a neighboring town earning a small monthly salary. \r\n\r\nAs the family's existing funds are modest and hardly enough to cover expenses, Marine and Teimuraz decided to start their own family business. With the received credit, they plan to hire a commercial space and purchase needed inventory for starting a food cafe. Teimuraz will leave his job and work in their cafe as a cook; he makes delicious dishes and is very skilled.\r\n\r\nMarine and Teimuraz hope that their project will be profitable as the cafe location is great and crowded with people. The couple believes that they will earn a good income for their family's well being and their son will be able to return home.\r\n\r\nThey await your kindness.

Her husband is a security guard and his income is insufficient to meet the household expenses. For one year, Farida has been running a beauty salon, and she wants to purchase some more cosmetic products and chairs for her beauty salon. For that reason, Farida has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan. Once she earns a profit, she will first repay the loan amount to Kiva and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is too much congested. She hopes that her business grows more and she is very much thankful to both Brac and

One of her children is in high school and the other two are at a lower level.  Her husband has worked in agriculture for many years, which has allowed them to earn the income to support their children.  He also works in masonry which supplements their income.  After school, their children help with household chores.\r\n\r\nThe family is made up of 5 people, 3 children and them, the parents.  On her end, Rosalina plants basic grains such as corn, beans and others.  She has been doing this for a long time, about 12 years, and in all of that time, she has been able to learn and gain experience, and now she knows all of the activities required for planting well.  She has been able to learn all of this thanks to her parents, and the help she has given her husband every planting season.  In order to get to the place where she works, she must walk half an hour.  In many occasions, her children also help her with the agricultural work.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be used to pay the labor necessary to pick the basic grains from this harvest in which she has 10,500 square meters of corn and beans.  Due to the change in season, she is worried because if she does not harvest the crops quickly, their family may suffer financial losses.  The loan will also help settle a debt, because 2 days before seeking this loan, her husbands father passes away.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to see her children get ahead.  She also wants to own the land that her house is on and be able to live without any problems, and for her family to have adequate conditions for a better future.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1469216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for the labor needed to harvest her crops, of which she has 10,500 square meters of corn and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T21:10:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":174.55,"local_amount":174.55,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":174.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622390},{"amount":191.16,"local_amount":191.16,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":191.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088771},{"amount":34.29,"local_amount":34.29,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":34.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903359}],"funded_date":"2013-11-16T00:19:18Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Roberto Henry"}},{"id":631859,"name":"Maria Esther","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda una mujer trabajadora de cuarenta y cuatro a\u00f1os de edad tiene tres hijas de 21, 19 y 15 a\u00f1os de edad, actualmente se encuentra separada de su esposo, viven en casa de sus padres ya que el esposo se quedo en su casa, la misma que est\u00e1 ubicada en una zona urbana de la ciudad de Latacunga, en la parroquia Eloy Alfaro, provincia Cotopaxi perteneciente a la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador este es un sector muy comercial de la ciudad por su buena ubicaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica.\nDebido a la mala situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica que atraves\u00f3 ella y sus hijas despu\u00e9s de la separaci\u00f3n de su esposo tuvo que trabajar y dedicarse a la crianza y venta de pollos, las ganancias las ha designado para la manutenci\u00f3n de su hija Ver\u00f3nica que es la menor de las tres debido a que sus dos hijas mayores ya est\u00e1n casadas y tienen su hogar formado\nSe dedica a la crianza de los pollos de 4 a 5 horas diarias, esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 de su madre, pero le resulta muy dif\u00edcil ya que no cuenta con una persona que le ayude; ya que por su trabajo de medio tiempo no le alcanza para poder atender su negocio, las ventas las realiza en forma ambulante y bajo pedido, solicita este cr\u00e9dito para la compra de m\u00e1s pollos y balanceado debido a que se acerca la \u00e9poca de navidad y en estas fechas la demanda es mayor a la de otros meses y esas ventas ayudar\u00e1n a incrementar las ganancias de Mar\u00eda.  \nMar\u00eda quiere extender un sincero agradecimiento y felicitaci\u00f3n a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en Ecuador y a Kiva por hacer posible el crecimiento en su vida laboral y personal, para brindarle a su hija una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Mar\u00eda, 44, is a hardworking woman.  Currently she's separated from her husband.  She has three daughters, ages 21, 19, and 15.  They live in her parents' house because her husband stayed in her house, which is located in an urban area in the city of Latacunga, in Eloy Alfaro Parish in the province of Cotopaxi, Republic of Ecuador.  This is a very commercial area of the city because of its good geographic location.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda had to work raising and selling chickens because of the bad economic situation she and her daughters went through after she separated from her husband.  She has used her earnings to support her daughter Ver\u00f3nica, the youngest of the three, because her two older daughters are already married and have their own families.\r\n\r\nShe works four or five hours a day raising chickens.  She learned this work from her mother, but it's hard for her because she doesn't have anyone to help her.  Because of her part-time job she doesn't have enough time to take care of her business.  She makes sales on foot and takes orders.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's requesting this loan to buy more chickens and balanced feed because Christmas is approaching and demand is greater than in other months.

With the received loan, Eka will start a confectionery shop. She is good at baking and wishes to sell her production to the local people.

married, and has four children. She has a high school education and raises livestock to support her family. She started farming 19 years ago when she bought cattle for 12,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work she now earns 19,000 som (KGS) per month, and her farm includes one milk cow, one horse, 50 sheep, and 1.25 hectares of land for planting potatoes and clover. She is a member of the group \"Khan-Burgo,\" which has two other members. In order to continue building up her farm, Nurjan asked the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves for breeding. With her income from the loan Nurjan plans to continue to invest in more livestock and to save money for her son's

story:\n\n\u201cEach of us, after ending school, should choose the university and the faculty where he or she wants to study. People are convinced that a person who goes to his work with pleasure and comes back home gladly every day, is the happiest one. Most of us are supposed to think about our future careers since childhood. But when we become older, we always change our viewpoints and preferences. Not all images, which we dreamed about, satisfy us. We become more realistic, and start envisaging a profession we want to choose. This is the choice of our path to the real life.\n\nThe world of departments of universities is prodigious. It consists of huge number of professions. Each of us is responsible for solving a great issue, for the new step in our life. in this moment of our lives, we doubt, take suggestions, hesitate, and listen to parents and friends opinion. This particular line of professions require people be able to make decisions quickly and manage people. Unfortunately, not always that we can define our abilities and make the right decisions at our young ages. I think no one, neither young nor old, can say quickly whatever decision they are up to.\n \nI thought many times and made a decision to enter the Liberal Arts department. What I like in this department is that it teaches leadership skills to us, historic thinking, religion, etc. Another reason to choose this department is that I would like to know little about juridical knowledge too. As a student of the department, it is necessary for me to graduate the university as a highly qualified person who is capable to think critically, and work in group by using my knowledge that I will already have.\n \nAnother opportunity that AUCA gives to every student is a Kiva loan. It is what can make dreams come true. I am applying for the loan as well, as I have financial difficulties and am not able to cover my tuition fees fully.\u201d \n

She realizes the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of family's income. As autumn is progressing, Lida's agribusiness needs some investments. A loan of USD 2,500 will be a great help to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling them to purchase some fertilizers and new layers for tree planting.

raising five children with her husband. Jyldyzkan has a secondary education. The family's primary source of income is animal husbandry, a business Jyldyzkan started eight years ago by purchasing 25,000 KGS worth of livestock. Thanks to Jyldyzkan's hard work, the farm currently boasts one dairy cow and five goats. Her monthly income is 6,000 KGS. Jyldyzkan is a member of the group \"Almaluu\". This group includes three other people. So there are four of them. Jyldyzkan is the leader of the group. In order to further develop her farm, Jyldyzkan asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 KGS to buy lambs for breeding. Jyldyzkan plans to invest income from the loan into increasing her livestock and plans to save money for the education of her children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1468669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy lambs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Almaluu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T22:30:04Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jyldyzkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":412.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053431},{"amount":383.13,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.37,"payment_id":561578082}],"funded_date":"2013-11-22T18:25:04Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T10:50:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":631708,"name":"Duong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Duong is a 26-year-old woman.

Con las ganancias que obtenga, Emma quiere ahorrar para lograr comprarse un terreno y luego hacerse su propia casita, que es con lo que tanto ha so\u00f1ado siempre.

Together, they have a 5 month old daughter, and they live in her mother-in-law's home in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas.  For the past few years, Cristian has worked in his father's carpentry business, where they make household furniture.  \r\n\r\nSince high school, Emma has wanted to help with household finances, which is why for the past 6 years, she has sold cosmetics from a catalog.  She has regular customers and everyday goes door to door down the long streets of her city to offer her products and collect payments.  She now has her her own home that she helps support with her earnings.  She is a client of the Fundacion Alternativa since last year.  The institution's service and flexibility grabbed her attention.  \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to invest in cosmetics because during this season, her sales increase because her customers purchase cosmetics, perfumes and various beauty sets to give as gifts during Christmas.  With her earnings, Emma wants to save to be able to purchase a plot of land and later build her own house, which has always been her dream. \r\n\r\nEmma is grateful for the support she has received from Fundacion Alternativa, who through Kiva, have been able to support her dreams and help her business grow.

She is married and has two children, none of whom is at school. For the past year, Martha has been working hard to manage her hotel business, which sells cooked food.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Martha has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy utensils for the hotel, and will help Martha to generate greater profits which will be used to buy clothes for her children. Martha hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a business of selling soft drinks. \r\n\r\nMartha is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Uganda. She has no children. For the past year, Getrude has been working hard to manage her poultry farm, which deals with chicken. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Getrude has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more feed for the chicken. It will help Getrude to generate greater profits and help her to provide necessitates for her family. Getrude hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nGetrude is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills
