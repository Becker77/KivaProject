With his children growing up and family expenses increasing, Farhod himself holds two jobs and spares no effort  to provide for his family. \n\nFarhod has been working at the Ecology Center for the past 15 years.  At the same time, he has been buying and selling fish for the past two years.  This year, his oldest son graduated from high school and enrolled at the \"Finance and Credit\" School of the Khujand State University.  His youngest son and daughter are still in school.  \n\nFarhod currently needs to pay his son's tuition fees at the University, which represent a large amount of money for the family.  Since he doesn't have the necessary funds, he has decided to apply for a loan.  Farhod really wants his son to get a higher education in the field of finance and to pursue his studies in this direction, as he has good analytic skills which should be developed.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1459082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Saikal has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide additional income for her family, Saikal is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 14 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Saikal's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 2 calves, 6 sheep and also 10 hectares of land, where she annually grows clover and wheat.

She started five years ago by buying 50,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work, she currently owns two milk cows and 25 sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her business, Salyimabubu asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 120,000 som (KGS) loan for the purchase of cows to expand her herd. Salyimabubu plans to invest profit earned from use of the loan into further expanding the number of livestock she owns, and she also plans to save money to finish building a house. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1467897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cows to expand her herd","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":405.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salyimabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1237.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1149.38,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":60186.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":88.12,"payment_id":561578067},{"amount":920.36,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":60186.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":317.14,"payment_id":752025293}],"funded_date":"2014-01-01T02:28:25Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:01:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":630251,"name":"Natiq","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natiq is a 33-year-old married person.

It took her a very long time to recover from the death of her beloved husband.  But she had to raise and put her children back on their feet, so she decided to take responsibility for the business and material circumstances and she took the situation in her own hands.  Matlubakhon has a secondary education and she is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business 35 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, she now owns two dairy cows and 5 sheep, and she cultivates 0.54 hectare (1.33 acre) of land on which she grows potatoes, cotton and vegetables. She makes a monthly income of 7,000 som (KGS).\n\nIn order to further develop her farming business, Matlubakhon has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to buy some cows which she will fatten and then resell at a higher price at the market.\n\nShe plans to re-invest the profits from this loan back into her business by purchasing additional livestock. She is also planning to save enough money for the construction of a new building in which she will keep her livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1468092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She has no children.  For the past 2 year, Federesi has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which deals in various products. \n\nTo help expand her business, Federesi has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more food items such as bread and milk for sale.  This will help Federesi to generate greater profits which will enable her to buy a plot of land.  Federesi hopes that in the future she will be able to build a permanent house.\n\nFederesi is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1469149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Rosa has worked as a housekeeper for the past 13 years, and she has been able to contribute to the household economy this way. In order to provide her family with more secure conditions, she is asking for this loan from Fusai to buy doors and windows for her home, since the ones she has are dilapidated and don't provide adequate security. She hopes to be able to get this support, since she doesn't have the money available to do it on her own.

She deals in cattle fattening and milking as her major source of income. She owns 80 cows, the majority of which are for milk production. Through income earned from milk, Fridah has managed to look after her family together with her husband by providing them all the basic necessities of life like housing, food, medication, and paying tuition for their 4 school-going children. \n\nIn addition to cattle, Fridah owns a retail shop in a trading center near her residence. She started this business because people would walk long distances to far away places to buy simple household items. She therefore decided to serve their needs and has since increased the capital base to provide most of the demanded items.\n\nFridah is applying for a loan of 3,000,000 UGX to buy more stock of items, especially soft drinks such as soda, because it\u2019s almost the holiday season when people will be holding parties. She therefore wants to be able to meet the demand. Stocking early will also help her to buy cheaply before prices rise.

She operates a Zoona mobile money transfer business at a shopping center located in Lusaka, Zambia.  Having been raised by her single mother, she now works very hard so that her daughter will have better opportunities and less hardship than she did during childhood.\n\nUpon graduating from college with a diploma in Marketing, Cecilia began working for Southern Cross Motors as a sales consultant.  This is her full-time employment.  However, she sees more opportunity for income in her mobile money transfer business that she runs to supplement her earnings and provide for her daughter and 72 year-old mother.  \n\nThis loan will allow Cecilia to grow her business by adding needed working capital to service additional customers in need of financial services at her shop.

His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan to help continue in the operation of his business. He will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand his product inventory.\r\n\r\nSamson dreams that his business will continue to grow and hopes to have a long life.

Becoming and developing as an independent country for Kyrgyzstan is not easy process, because we have to learn many things for the first time. Today, we have to solve everything by ourselves, whereas before everything was solved by the Soviet Union Government. In overcoming difficulties, many economic, social, and legal mistakes were made and still are being made. Twenty years of independence is not a small term for developing a country. I am almost a contemporary of our young country.\r\n\r\nSeeing failures in the implementation of goals of our country, I am really worried, but also sincerely happy for the success of our country. Many people go to other countries looking for earnings and a better life. Thanks to them, the main part of the population of our country is surviving and has come out of material and financial difficulties. Studying at AUCA, I am sure that only here I will get an excellent education and the best professional skills which will be useful in my future life. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to its students, one of which is Kiva loans. It is one of the best opportunities, because students are able to cover their tuition fees. I would like to apply for a Kiva loan, too. It will give me an opportunity to fully dedicate myself to my studies, rather than worrying about how to make money to cover my tuition.\u201d

He is married and has three children. Makhkamjon lives with his family in a small house in a rural village. He cares about his family and does everything he can to keep them well-fed. He works as a call agent for a company that produces soft drinks. He earns a good income there, but it\u2019s not enough to cover all of the family\u2019s needs. So Makhkamjon does animal husbandry on the side. He has a plot of land where he can look after his animals. Currently he has several head of cattle, but he would like to increase their number. His wife helps him to look after and raise the cattle. The livestock business is lucrative, so Makhkamjon wants to expand this business by acquiring more animals.  He has turned to Arvnad to request a loan to buy a cow. Makhkamjon thanks Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1460329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T16:20:10Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxkamjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":76.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":81.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":97.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":224.36,"local_amount":224.36,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":224.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673578},{"amount":78.24,"local_amount":78.24,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":78.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144368},{"amount":80.03,"local_amount":80.03,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":80.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960188},{"amount":81.86,"local_amount":81.86,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":81.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180948},{"amount":83.74,"local_amount":83.74,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875547},{"amount":85.65,"local_amount":85.65,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":85.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302774},{"amount":87.62,"local_amount":87.62,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":87.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585575},{"amount":89.62,"local_amount":89.62,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":89.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081157},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562035},{"amount":97.21,"local_amount":97.21,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":97.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694725}],"funded_date":"2014-01-13T19:32:03Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peter and Lynne Weil","image":null}},{"id":632039,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mom is 50 years old.

She is originally from Managua, which is located in the central region of her country.  This young mother is known for being responsible, hardworking, and for dedicating her life to helping offer a better future to her young son.  In her free time, she likes to enjoy the company of her son.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, she wasn't able to go to school and instead had to work starting at a very young age.  Currently, she has an even greater need to work because she is playing the roles of both mother and father to her little son.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and desire to get ahead, she is able to work selling atol (a traditional, cornstarch-based drink).  She runs her business from her house and also sells as a street vendor.  The purpose of this loan is to invest in working capital and stock her business with raw materials that she will use to make atol.  These include corn, cinnamon, sugar, disposable cups, bags, and milk.  She hopes that with this loan she will soon be able to obtain greater profits.\r\n\r\nYesenia is thankful to Kiva lenders who help those with scant resources and who are from poor countries such as Nicaragua because it helps support them as they obtain respectable ways to support themselves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1469407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"invest in working capital and buy raw materials for her business such as corn, cinnamon, sugar, disposable cups, bags, and milk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesenia Yahoska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.09,"local_amount":1252.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1252.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545965},{"amount":56.39,"local_amount":1409.72,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1410,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199740},{"amount":65.71,"local_amount":1642.83,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1643.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459139754},{"amount":427.81,"local_amount":10695.24,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10697.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490870935}],"funded_date":"2013-11-15T21:27:46Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T15:57:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":632038,"name":"Rona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rona is 37 years old and married.

He initially worked for some dairy companies but took the chance to go out on his own and earn money for himself. He now has 12 dairy cows, and he sells the milk daily to one of the country's largest dairy businesses. He is able to earn enough money to provide for his family, which comprises his wife and two children. His effort, tenacity, and dedication have allowed him to prosper and overcome the biggest challenges life presented, especially during times when supplies to take care of his livestock were very expensive.\r\n\r\nHe has applied for a loan to buy two milk cows to increase his herd. This will let him produce more milk to sell and increase his daily earnings. Luis wants to keep striving to achieve his goals and dreams, especially to have a minimum of 20 cows so that he use all the available space on the farm he rents. His business would then be more profitable, and he would be able to offer his family greater financial stability, greater well being, and a better standard of living.

He lives in the rural area of Lahore, Pakistan with his wife and daughter. He has been in the business of selling milk for many years. This is the only source of income for the family. He has a few buffalo for his milk-selling business. He delivers milk in the market and door-to-door. For delivery purposes, he uses his bicycle. He loads milk cans on his bicycle and delivers them early in the morning. His customers like the fresh and delicious milk he delivers. His monthly net income is too low to meet the household needs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he planned to purchase one more buffalo to increase his sales. However, he finds it difficult due to financial constraints. Anwar Masih has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. This will not only help him to increase sales, but it will also increase his net income and savings as well. He hopes to provide a quality education for his children. He is a very hardworking and responsible person. He is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1469659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk

He has been growing his herd of cattle through breeding. Now he has many buffaloes that produce milk.\r\n\r\nHe is famous in his hometown due to the quality and freshness of his milk. He preserves milk for household usage and sells milk in his hometown. His family has been growing for many years and this means a rapid increase in basic necessities. He has devoted one of his buffaloes to his family's needs, but this means that for his business, the milk runs short daily. He wants to buy another buffalo to fulfill the shortage of milk.\r\n\r\nDuring his review, the field officer that met with him took his problem seriously and approved his desired loan. M. Tufail will be very happy after receiving this loan because the new buffalo will cause his herd to grow and reduce the shortage of milk.\r\n\r\nHe thanks Kiva and field partner, BRAC Pakistan. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1469106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a buffalo in order to increase his milk sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M.

Her husband owns an un-stitched clothing business, which is the only source of income for the family. Presently he needs additional capital for the growth of her business. For that, Akhtar is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase variety of clothes to sell. This way he can respond quickly to customer needs. With the help of the profit amount he will put aside some savings to pay for the electricity and gas bill. Akhtar hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

She is married to Avelino and they have two children who are both studying. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nAlicia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nAlicia dreams to have another stall and hopes to have a better living.

It is made up of 10 women and 2 men, and with the help of loans, they are improving their businesses and improving their quality of life and that of their families. They all have different businesses with most of them working in the commercial sector. One of the members of the group is Mrs. Maria Magdalena. She is 46 years old, married and has three children. Two of them are older and one of them only has 12 years old. They go to school and the youngest still lives with her. Her husband is an electrician. Mrs. Maria Magdalena learned how to cut and sew in the city a few years ago, and with this knowledge she has been earning a living because her husband is not able to earn enough to cover all the household expenses. She works Monday through Friday in a sewing workshop where she receives a monthly salary, but other than working there, she also works for herself in the evenings and on the weekends, making all kinds of clothes, and she is able to earn good money. There are times when she needs to rise with the dawn in order to finish her orders because she likes to finish on time, as promised to her customers. The loan is to purchase fabrics, threads and other sewing materials so she can continue sewing. This is her first loan with the communal bank and she likes it because she receives her loan quickly. Her dream is to have her own workshop in the center of town. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4825,"image":{"id":1469485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"purchase fabric, thread and other sewing materials.

Monthly income consists of 13,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nAnarkan is the third member of the borrower group \"Bakyt.\" With the aim of further developing her homestead, Anarkan turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy calves for increasing her livestock count. \r\n\r\nAnarkan plans to invest income from the loan in further increasing the quantity of domestic animals, and plans to save money for building a new home for her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1468869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ketmentobo village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-15T19:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-14T19:40:11Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":110.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33000},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33000},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":684.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":684.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":705.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":684.75,"local_amount":33000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":33303.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178307},{"amount":635.99,"local_amount":33000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":33303.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":48.76,"payment_id":561578088},{"amount":643.46,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34312.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":62.04,"payment_id":649513451}],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T20:44:20Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":632119,"name":"Mahammed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mahammed is 55 years old and married.

They are from Sauce which is located in the northern part of the country and is known for its production of milk, cheese and cream.  These are hard-working, enterprising women with a strong desire for personal advancement. Unfortunately, they could not go to school and have been working since they were very young to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and desire to get ahead, Segunda is the bank coordinator. She earns her livelihood by selling curd from her house and also door-to-door. This woman's work routine is to get up very early to prepare for her sales, and then she spends about eight hours each day selling door-to-door. The purpose of the loan is to buy more ingredients for making curd, such as milk and rennet so that in the not-too-distant future she will have a better income. The communal bank Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe is grateful for the help that Kiva investors offer to people of limited resources and poor countries like Nicaragua so that they might have a dignified way to earn a living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1469511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Precisamente por motivos laborales y de estudios es que de lunes a viernes vive en la ciudad en casa de unos t\u00edos; pero su familia y su hijo de 4 a\u00f1os viven en Portachuelo que es una localidad distante a unos 70 Km. de la ciudad, a donde regresa todos los fines de semana para estar con ellos, sobretodo con su peque\u00f1o que es quien la inspira para lograr sus metas y trabaja por \u00e9l.\n\nA Mirian le gusta mucho lo que estudia y le va muy bien, pero ha encontrado ciertos problemas para pagar sus estudios pues al ser madre soltera y sus padres de escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos no cuenta con ingresos elevados. Al finalizar sus estudios piensa postularse a un cargo superior en el mismo banco y as\u00ed contar con las posibilidades econ\u00f3micas para tener a su hijo viviendo con ella todos los d\u00edas. \n\nMiriam, tiene sus esperanzas puestas en el financiamiento de sus estudios, afirmando que lo que la hace destacar de otros alumnos es que ella ya se encuentra trabajando en el \u00e1rea de la especializaci\u00f3n que requiere, por lo que ser\u00e1 un buen complemento para poner en pr\u00e1ctica todos los nuevos conocimientos adquiridos.

She is part way through the Expert in International Business and Exports programme in the European Business School, and she wants to apply to EDUCA-PRO for a loan so she can finalise the financing of her studies.\r\n\r\nMirian currently works as an assistant in Foreign Commerce in the Banco Uni\u00f3n. For work and study reasons she lives at her uncle's in the city from Monday to Friday but her family and her 4 year old son live in Portachuelo which is 70km from the city. Each weekend she returns home to be with her family and especially with her little son who is her inspiration to achieve her goals and she works for him.\r\n\r\nMirian really enjoys what she is studying and it is going well for her, but she has had a few problems paying for her studies because she is a single mother and her parents have limited means so she does not have much of an income. When she finishes her studies she hopes to apply for a more senior position in the same bank and so have the finances to make it possible to have her son living with her all the time.\r\n\r\nMirian firmly hopes she will get the finance for her studies and says that what makes her stand out from the other students is that she is already working in her preferred area of specialisation and this will be a good complement so she can put into practice all of her newly acquired knowledge. She thinks her life would have been much more promising if she had not had family obstacles such as the separation from her partner when she was expecting, or the stroke which her father suffered, and other problems of an economic nature which she has to fight to overcome every day. However, the mere act of submitting her paperwork to apply for a loan makes her happy and optimistic, since other people would be helping her to fulfil the dreams and goals which she has set out in life. She thanks God and the people who are supporting her to allow her to have professional development.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1456824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

","en":"Akmaljon is a positive and responsible forty-year-old man. He is married and has three children. He lives with his family in a small village. However, the house in which they live is too small and poorly built. Akmaljon's wife is a very hardworking woman and caring mother. Akmaljon  works buying and selling cars, and his wife has a small sewing shop in the local market. This is how they earn their living. The money they make is just enough to live. But they dream of building a large house for their family. But to do that, they need the money. The fact is, they do not earn enough to build a new home. Therefore, Akmaljon has asked Arvand for a loan to buy building materials to build a house. Akmaljon and his wife are hoping for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1466282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

","en":"Gufronkhon is a friendly and responsible 26 year old. He is married and has one child. He lives with his family in a small village. But the house in which they live is too small and not well built. Gufronkhon's wife is a housewife, a very hardworking and caring mother. Gufronkhon works as a cook in a local cafeteria. He hasn't worked there long and earns an average wage. This salary is only enough for Gufronkhon to pay for food. However, he has a dream. Gufronkhon wants to renovate his house so it will be pleasant to live in. But for this he needs money. The fact is he does not earn enough to repair his home. Therefore, Gufronkhon turned to Arvand for a loan to buy construction materials to repair his home. He hopes for a positive outcome, and thanks Arvand in advance for its support.

But at the moment Ahmadjon is in a hurry to plant the May crop. This planting happens at the end of fall and is harvested in May. Since in Tajikistan summer and autumn last a long time, and through December the warm weather lasts, Ahmadjon has a chance to realize a crop. But he does not have enough money to buy wheat seeds, fuel, mineral fertilizers and to pay a tractor driver to work the land.

Abrahan is currently attending the Universidad Juan Misael Saracho working towards his degree in computer engineering. He plans on graduating in April 2014, but he fears that he will need to defer his graduation without a loan from Vittana.\n\nWith this loan, Abrahan plans on purchasing his much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Abrahan feels he will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. In addition to his responsibilities at school, Abrahan currently works 30 hours a week as a computer technician to help cover his school and living expenses. With a career in computer engineering, he expects to earn $32 a day. \n\nUnfortunately, Abrahan's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, his parents never had the chance to move up. Abrahan's father works as a driver and his salary is the family's primary source of income. Growing up, finances have always been tight. With three other siblings, Abrahan is unsure how he will be able to finance his education without help.

The materials required to make the foundation are expensive, so it was not possible for him to run the business effectively. Lagina decided to join BJS and take a loan so they can buy supplies for the business. Now with the help of Lagina, her husband will buy bamboo the other materials and can earn more money. They are thankful for BJS and Kiva for helping to improve their

However, Gloria is now in charge of the business and her mother just supports her with some of the work.  So far, Gloria has had no major problems in this work.\r\n\r\nGloria will invest this loan in buying supplies for her \"pupusa\" stall.  She will buy pork, corn, tortillas with cream cheese filling, and seasoning, and will improve her promises in order to offer better service to her customers.  With this she can increase her income, attract more customers, and pay off her debt.\r\n\r\nGloria's dream is to be able to help her husbands with the costs of feeding and educating their children.

All of them go to school; they are in class XII (grade 12), class X (grade 10) class VII (grade 7) and class IV (grade 4). \r\n\r\nHer husband has a cultivation business. They have their own land, which is near their home. Due to lack of finances, Basanti and her husband couldn\u2019t use their land, so she decided to take a loan for potato cultivation. Potatoes are in demand in West Bengal and also throughout India, and her husband also has knowledge about this business. She hopes it can be a profitable for them.\r\n\r\nBasanti wants this loan to buy potato seeds and fertilizers and to cover labour cost.\r\n\r\nIn the future she hopes to purchase more land for her agricultural business, which will improve the financial condition of their family. She hopes her children receive a good education and do not suffer in the future and can live happily throughout their lives. She is very much thankful to BJS and Kiva for funding her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1469971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy potato seeds and fertilizers, and to cover labour costs for cultivating potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2013-11-16T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-15T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T14:44:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":632295,"name":"Jarina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jarina is a 40-year-old woman and the mother of three children.

To help expand his business, Milton has requested a loan of 2,500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more stock, and it will help Milton to generate greater profits and complete his house and improve his standard of living. Milton hopes that in the future he will be able to increase sales and profits. \r\n\r\nMilton is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).
