She is a farmer and homemaker, and mother to an 8-month-old son. Along with her housemate, she works arduously to get ahead. They get up early in the morning every day to work in the field and help their coffee crops since they are the source of income for their family. Her level of secondary education completed, she was able to graduate with her high school degree in Social Promotion. She was supported by her parents to whom she is thankful for the efforts they made so that she could study.\r\n\r\nSince she was 8 years old, she has grown coffee, which she learned to do from her parents. The land that she works along with her partner is her own thanks to the work she has performed for various years. This work has paid off so that they could work in their own way. The land, to which they walk, is located 2 kilometers from their home. The coffee is the means that provides the necessary income to be able to provide clothing, food, and medicine, although with many restrictions, among other things.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is currently requesting a loan to purchase fertilizers and agricultural supplies that will help her to maintain her crops healthy and protected, and also to set aside another portion to be able to remove weeds, among others.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to continue increasing her coffee crops through the purchase of more land to strengthen her children\u2019s inheritance. She also would like to be able to find a respectable job where she can also contribute to the household income. Her dream is to continue studying at the university and be able to graduate to provide a better well-being to her son and those to come in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1470188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase agricultural supplies to be able to help her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-16T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-15T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Besy Nohemy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":13166.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579541398}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T13:35:25Z","paid_date":"2014-12-22T10:25:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":632384,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace  is 38 years old and lives in the town of Fort Portal in the Fort Portal region of Uganda.

Sales have started to increase as the Christmas season is approaching.  There is a lot of demand for \"tamales\" but customers are mainly looking for pork dishes.  Beatriz is applying for a loan as she does not have enough capital and needs to buy pigs in cash, as they will be a little bit cheaper that way.  Beatriz also wants to take advantage and buy unripened tomatoes that she can leave in the house until they are ready.  That way she will not have to pay such high prices as she would at Christmas.  Beatriz receives a lot of support from her children and husband who slaughter the pigs.  Because of this, Beatriz does not have to pay for this service.  Beatriz's goal is to own a restaurant as people have told her she is an excellent cook.  She hopes that you will continue to support her with loans as they have been a great help for Beatriz and her

She is married with three children.  For 10 years, Abie has been operating a food stand business. She began her business because she wanted to create a daily living for her children.  She works at the business from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm, 7 days per week. She is very hard working and desires to improve her standard of living\r\n\r\nAbie requires a loan in order to purchase a variety of rice, flour and cooking seasoning to expand her business.

Administration. Here is his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best way to make a career is to work out a plan. I always dreamt about good career and to become a businessman or manager of a big company. But I realized that it is not easy to become successful businessman. It is necessary to have personal qualities, such as hard workmanship, courage, leadership, ability to work in a team, make decision in difficult situations, be responsible for ones acts. I am confident that the knowledge and skills gained in AUCA will be invaluable contribution to make my dream happen. I was studying at local school in Balykchy. Later I applied and was accepted to the Turkish lyceum in Karakol, where i have been studying for the past five years. I had a good opportunity to improve my language skills and deepen my knowledge of math and learn teamwork skills. I am interested and reading about various large famous companies, about how they were created, how they reached success, I admire those people who could open and develop own business in our unstable political situation in the country. Our country needs young professional creative and honest people, who will be able to improve everything: economics, business, agriculture and all other aspects. To my opinion this university can give me a high qualified knowledge. AUCA has good reputation that provides high quality education. AUCA gives another unique opportunity to its students, which is loan. The loan is given to all students applying for financial aid, which is given my Kiva. I am very happy that AUCA cooperates with such a great organization that gives us \u2013 students such opportunity.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1470505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Here is his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI decided to enroll [in] the American University of Central Asia, department of Economics and have several reasons for this. First, economics is the most important science for the countries, particularly for work of banks. Their prosperity and success lies in their activity in economy. So in my opinion the knowledge of economics is required. Economists are demanded almost everywhere. For example, in government sectors, banking and financial activity of companies and industries. I am interested in economics and I want to build my career in the field of economics. This department will give me ability to take basic knowledge of this science and will help me to be successful in future because of the high level of education of the education. So this program will give me a lot of possibilities. In general AUCA is a perfect place to start a successful career, and can be long to describe the benefits of this university. I am very proud to be part of this great team. \r\n\r\n\"Amongst all other great opportunities that AUCA provides its students, another opportunity is that [it] gives loans to them. I would like to apply for [a] Kiva loan, as my family is not able to cover my tuition fully, so it will help me to solve my financial

Thus, she is requesting a loan of 38,000 PHP [Philippines pesos] to buy diapers, babies' milk powder, coffee, sugar, noodles, toothpaste and raw ingredients used in cooking food for meals. She hopes that her business will continue to grow smoothly for her to become a successful entrepreneur

Some time ago she had the opportunity to attend a conference for a well known international nutritional product company. She saw the opportunity for a profitable business as people today pay more attention to their health to look and feel better. So she decided to sell these goods with the intention of generating income to help support her household.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she has gained knowledge and her clientele has grown which allowed her to open her own nutrition club. Which has had good results and has been well received in the municipality where she lives as it is the only one there. Also she can count on her family who use the products and also sells them. \r\n\r\nHer entrepreneurial spirit, drive and energy have motivated her to request a loan with which she will buy stock wholesale (shakes, malts, vitamins, dietary supplements, etc.) and supply her business with enough to satisfy the demand for products and necessities of her customers. This will bring about an increase in sales and the profit that that generates. Also she can be more competitive in the market, making her business more profitable. \r\n\r\nLuisa dreams of sustaining her business, and to continue to offer her services as a nutritional adviser which will permit her to receive more revenue to improve her quality of life and

He learned this job from his father and is grateful to him for it now because he's getting his family ahead.  For four years he has worked taking care of an irrigation channel.\r\n\r\nHis day begins at 4:30 a.m.  While his wife prepares his breakfast he helps her shuck the corn that she'll sell later in the day with tostadas, potatoes, and so forth.  Then he goes to work for 5:30 a.m., walking some 30 minutes to get there; he returns home at 6 p.m.\r\n\r\nHe's going to use the loan to repair his house because the metal roofing is no longer good and the adobe walls are washing away from the rain.

Josephine hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nJosephine is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Josephine who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1470681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

54 years old, married and has a son together with her husband. Jainagul has vocational training. As a main source of income for her family, Jainagul works with livestock breeding, after having started 31 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 400 som (KGS). Thanks to Jainagul's persistent work, her farm currently has four dairy cows, eight horses and 38 sheep. The monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Jainagul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep to increase the number of livestock. Jainagul plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals. She also plans to save money for her son's

He has worked very hard for many years to get his family ahead and give them everything they deserve. He has a grocery store; that is his main source of income. He began his business with too little capital to allow it to run well, and it didn't make much profit at first. Then, he made a plan to develop his business, so he borrowed an extra amount and opened a grocery. Many people prefer his store because he always has the basic staples at accessible prices, and he provides the best possible customer service. His dream is to see his store flourish. Due to the current bad situation in Yemen, he has less profit from his enterprise.

In order to be able to do this, she buys grains of incense that she mixes with different perfumes and keeps in glass pots for several months in order to get the finished product. Her new loan will allow her to buy raw incense and different perfumes with which to make various flavours of incense. The profits generated by her business will enable her to support her husband more with the general management of the household and to better help her children with their education

Together with his mother and brother, they live in Vanadzor city, which is in the Lori region. Davit has graduated from Vanadzor State Engineering University in the faculty of Economics. Since his childhood, Davit has liked to decorate and design anything in their house. In other words, he has been a very creative person since he was just a little boy. \r\n\r\nDuring his studentship he used to attend some jewelry making courses by different famous masters, and in two years he became very skilled. He learned all the secrets and various tricks of that field. Now he is a rather famous master with honor in his city. \r\n\r\nIn their flat, he has separated a small room and turned it into a small workshop where he creates unbelievably beautiful jewelry made of silver and gold; he makes pendants, necklaces and rings. He takes private orders from his already loyal customers or sells his jewelry at the city jewelry shops. He has nearly all the necessary equipment and tools for his work in order to make cute, high quality jewelry.\r\n\r\nDavit is asking for a loan of 500,000 AMD in order to buy a special heater and some raw materials for his work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1470686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to

Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\"The most important period in life for the person is the choice of future profession. Therefore, it is necessary to approach to this choice very carefully, considering all pluses and minuses, to understand whether you will be able to be engaged in the chosen business for the rest of the life. I have done my choice and decided to study in International and Business Law department. As I consider, a lawyer has to have a huge stock of merits, such as responsibility, logical thinking, persistence, confidence, good memory, initiative, emotional stability.\r\n\r\n\"It is inconceivable to imagine the worthy lawyer without the following human qualities such as fairness, honesty, justice, responsiveness, humanity, a feeling of honor, decency, respect, conscientiousness, high idea of a professional duty. It is by far not the complete list, but I believe that the main qualities were noted by me. \r\n\r\n\"Everything that I listed is close to me. For this reason I choose the profession of lawyer. Also, a legal education promotes development of the personality as it includes studying historical, public and social disciplines, which are very interesting to me.\r\n\r\n\"My profession will allow me to help people who need my help. Barriers and difficulties which will get in my way of study time and also after it attract me and give a peculiar motivation to development. I want to help people and constantly feel that I am necessary to them. \r\n\r\n\"AUCA will give me a quality education by means of which I will be able to achieve my goals. I very hope to study in AUCA, where I will learn from qualified teachers, experts of their business. I plan to increase the acquired knowledge and courageously to go by my own way [to a] bright future. Modern society needs good experts of law, which I hope to become. Amongst other opportunities, AUCA provides financial aid to all its students, through Kiva loans. I would also like to take the opportunity and apply for [a] Kiva loan. It will give me a great ability to cover my tuition fees.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1470776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The dairy-products and potatoes he cultivates, he sells through re-sellers, and the meat he sells to local butchers.\r\n\r\nArtavazd, together with farming, also does construction work, and in this way he tries to enlarge his family income.\r\nArtavazd asks for a loan of 1,000,000 Armenian Drams in order to buy a lot of fodder for his farm cattle, since he did not manage to collect any yet and

He has noticed a high demand for a dinner hall in his district. In response to the local market demand, he has requested credit to finance the costs of purchasing building materials and all the needed inventories for starting a dinner hall. He owns commercial space, and after renovation and furnishing, Mevludi will be able to host wedding parties, birthdays, etc. Local people will pay for using the hall and Mevludi will earn extra

Right now, her husband\u2019s business is not running smoothly due to insufficient equipment (wire, switches, plugs, etc.) and that is affecting their financial condition. So she decided to take a loan and try to purchase a lot of the equipment needed for her husband's business and help him to earn more profit with his business. This business will be profitable for them because during construction, electrical wiring is needed.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to give a proper education to her child and make their family strong financially.
