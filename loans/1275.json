Hamlet is the only breadwinner of the family, as his mother is retired and his wife takes care of household only. \r\n\r\nBy applying for this loan Hamlet asks for financial support to be able to purchase a sporting ground needed for his job. This will give him an opportunity to improve the quality of training he provides and make his training more time efficient. Hamlet has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. This hard working and enthusiastic man, Hamlet, will be very thankful for the loan as it is very important to him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1470912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

Elda sells fruit. In the mornings, she works as an assistant in a restaurant that is owned by her friend which generates an income. In the afternoons, she sells fruit in a nearby market. She began this activity by making purchases of fruit in small quantities with her own capital. Seeing the good reception given to this business, she decided to continue and dedicate herself to this activity alone. Prior to starting this activity, her income was little and she did not have enough to cover all household expenses, as she had separated from the father of her children. Given this difficulty, she decided to start this business. Seeing the good results, she plans to continue and increase her business as it has become well-known in the area. She hopes to buy a variety of fruits to have a better reception in the market and grow her business in this way. This will be her 7th loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support she has received to move forward. She agrees to pay her dues on time. With the amount requested of 1,200 nuevos soles, she will buy fruit wholesale to stock her business and offer more variety to customers.

Little by little she has acquired experience and her own clientele. She works every day but does not have a fixed schedule. In this manner she generates enough revenue to cover the household expenses as she is the head of the household. Her drive, enthusiasm and dynamism have motivated her to request a loan to help her invest in buying stock at wholesale (cosmetics, body creams, perfume, accessories, etc.) In this way she can take advantage of discounts and promotions reducing the cost of her product. She can increases her profit margin with each sale and she can meet the customer demand which is always high at the end of the year. This will increase the income she makes for her labor.In this way Mar\u00eda will continue to struggle overcoming the obstacles put in her way and face the main challenge she has.

She says that the main challenges to her business are insufficient capital to expand her business and the poor road network.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan to purchase more palm oil and gari to expand her business.

She lives in a municipality near the city of Barranquilla. Juana\u2019s business is making and selling fried foods and arepas asadas [grilled flatbreads made with maize flour and served with cheese or meat]. She started her business two years ago, when she recognized the potential to sell to people who were leaving for work without having eaten breakfast. \r\n\r\nAt first, Juana observed the experiences of a woman with a business in a nearby neighborhood. She then followed her example to make her dream way to earn money a reality.  \r\n\r\nJuana\u2019s main products are skewers of beef and chicken, arepas asadas and different fried foods, which she says become delicacies for the people who buy them. Every day, Juana gets up and prepares the dough, which she cuts, molds and fills with delicious meat, chicken and vegetables. She makes her sales out of her home in cash, Monday through Sunday, from four until ten in the morning.

She is excited to be taking her ninth loan with Kiva's partner, Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business where she sells motor oil and gasoline.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 9,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nJosephine dreams that her business will be flourishing and hopes to give her children a good life and education.

Kulbarchin has a high school education, and provides the primary source of income for her family by raising animals. She started 8 years ago with a 20,000 som (KGS) purchase of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work, she now owns a dairy cow. She earns a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business Kulbarchin came to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 110,000 som (KGS) loan to buy cows to increase her herd. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further expanding the number of animals she has, and saving for construction of a new house.

She is married with two children. In 2007, Adama established her drug-vending business. She began her business because she needs to create income to support the home. She works at the business twelve hours per day and seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is that moving door to door to sell her drugs is very difficult.\r\n\r\nAdama requires a loan in order to buy variety of medical drugs to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and have a permanent business location. In the future, Adama plans to own a big pharmacy.

All of her children are married and living apart from their parents. Sagipakan has a high school education, and provides the primary source of income for her family by raising livestock. She started 34 years ago with a 1,000 som (KGS) purchase of animals. Thanks to her tireless work Sagipakan now has two dairy cows, a horse, and ten sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business Sagipakan came to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 50,000 som (KGS) loan to buy two heifers to increase her head of livestock. She plans to invest the earnings from use of the loan into further expanding her herd, and she also plans to save for construction of an additional shelter for the animals.

Recently, Sora decided to start raising cattle, which, she thinks, is a profitable business that she can carry-on in parallel to her agricultural work.  Sora will collect feed for the cattle from her own plot of land.  Already, she has collected and saved 400 bales of dried corn stalks and 30 bales of dried grasses.  In other words, Sora has all of the tools that she needs to carry out her enterprise.  She will keep cattle in the bard, which was built as an addition to her house.  \r\n\r\nSora has saved 500 dollars, however, this is not enough money to purchase additional calves.  She is asking for a loan to purchase four calves that she will raise for the duration of 30-35 days, after which, she will sell them at a premium price at the market.

His recent 34 years of life, he had spent on the road.  Muhabatsho is a taxi driver.  He has a lot of experience in this line of work and a number of permanent clients.  This work provided Muhabatsho's family with their sole source of income.  Working as a taxi drive, he was able to raise his children to be independent adults.  However, Muhabatsho is not about to leave his job; he considers himself to be young enough to continue to bring in some income.  \r\n\r\nHis car had become his best friend.

Because of his family's economic circumstances, he was unable to get a higher education. Instead, he stayed in his hometown after graduation and started to work in order to take care of his large family.\n\nNozimjon has rented a booth where he currently sells SIM cards, phone panels, chargers as well as other phone replacement components.  However, he has never abandoned his dream of becoming a camera operator one day.  He now has the opportunity to make his dream come true.  He wants to buy a camcorder and start offering video services.  He plans to make videos at weddings, ceremonies, national holidays and various other events.\n\nIn Tajikistan, most celebrations and festivities are held on weekends.  Therefore, Nozimjon intends to work on Saturdays and Sundays.  On week days, he plans to edit his video recordings and continue to sell SIM cards.  Working as a cameraman and filming various events is not only Nozimjon's old dream, but it should also be a profitable activity.\n\nUnfortunately, Nozimjon doesn't have enough money to buy a camcorder.  A professional video camera is expensive and purchasing one costs a lot of money, which is the reason why he is taking a loan.  He will use his loan to buy a camcorder and make his dream come true."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":1469713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

For this, I must say thanks to my whole family for motivation and support. Graduates have a difficult choice. They must make the right decision about what they exactly want from life. This starts from choice of faculty, university and even a country where they want to study. I think everyone in our country and even in Central Asia dreams about studying at AUCA. My dream is to study at AUCA also. From early childhood, I was interested in law because of movies. I was inspired by things that I have seen. People who work in this area are like freedom fighters. In their behavior, they can be a little bit aggressive because in some moments you will need to be like that because in my life I have seen lots of injustice to humans. To become a highly qualified specialist, I chose AUCA, as there are highly qualified professors, who work with modern system. All the classes are taught in English. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to its student and one of them is Kiva loans. I would like to apply for a Kiva loan as my family is not able to cover my tuition fees fully. With the loan, I will be able to cover my tuition fully and dedicate myself to my studies to become a highly qualified specialist.\u201d

This is the region with coffee, tea, and dairy farming. It is also the region that has had a lot of problems with deforestation. Monica is one of the many women who use wood and dung fuels for cooking and kerosene for lighting. Their income levels do not enable them to install and sustain electricity. Their life is hardened by the fact that the forests are preserved and hence it is not easy to get wood. Monica suffers every weekend walking up and down the hills to go fetch water and collect enough wood to last her the week so that she can do other duties during the weekdays.\r\n\r\nShe learned about VEP and the biogas project at the community training and from some of their promotional materials. Determined to resolve the fuel issue, she approached VEP to help her construct a biodigester (a device that turns organic waste into methane fuel) at her home. She has received a biogas loan and started the lifechanging project that will empower her and her family with cleaner, cheaper, and more efficient fuel. This will also save her one day in her weekends to rest and be with her children. The biogas will also supply her with light so she will not need to buy kerosene anymore. This will be good for her children who need to study in the evening and can now enjoy more study hours. We believe this will improve their grades. With the monthly income from tea and sale of milk from her three cows, Monica will be able to repay the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1126.13,"image":{"id":1468787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

After production, she will sell her product at her food stall.

She will then make the products and sell them in the Bolivian borders. This allows her to generate enough resources to support her household, as she is divorced and has three children. \r\n\r\nWhen she is asked about what she likes in Pro Mujer, she says she likes the area of health and loan training, and the consultancy services.

un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de una vaca lechera lo cual le ser\u00e1 de gran ayuda para poder mejorar sus ingresos. Luis ha sacado a delante a su  esposa y sus hijos siendo \u00e9stos su mayor orgullo y por eso est\u00e1 muy agradecido con  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en Ecuador y a Kiva por hacer posible el crecimiento en su vida laboral y personal.","en":"Luis is 43 years old. He was born in Pujil\u00ed, which is in the province of Cotopaxi. This canton is known as the Musical Emporium of Ecuador. Here most of its residents like music a lot and make this art a way of life. \r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacle in his life has been not being able to finish his education, and he only finished primary school. His mother wasn't able to have the resources necessary to give and education to Luis and his siblings. Since he was very young, they have done farm work and cared for animals (cows, pigs, sheep, chicken, etc.) to pay for the household expenses. That is why Luis, with all of the experience he has now, works buying and selling sheep. With this, he has been able to be a great moral and financial support for his family. His wife is the one who helps him most of the time. He has never given up and despite all of the need he has gone through he has been a fighter. He works four or five hours a day two days a week. The rest of the time he does agricultural work, caring for his crops.\r\n \r\nFor Luis it is difficult to transport his animals to the different markets in the city, since the sector he lives in has hills and mountains so it is very difficult to get his animals out. Today he is asking for a loan to buy a dairy cow, which will be a big help to improve his income. Luis has been able to get his wife and children ahead. They are his biggest pride and that is why he is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making growth possible in his work and personal life.

As part of the Focal Point of Achacachi, it consists of eight members and is run by a board of directors where Se\u00f1ora Rosa is president.

Currently, she has a business knitting and selling blankets.  She says that she learned this work from a friend who taught her knitting techniques.  Later she decided to set up her own retail shop.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out now is to increase her capital (buy the wool) that she gets at the traditional fairs in the city of El Alto, and that she will later sell, after knitting, in the rural festivals. This type of work allows her to generate income to keep up her home as well as possible, because she is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answered that she likes the training in health and financial credit.\r\nOne of the group members can\u2019t be found in the picture, because she left to care for her cattle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1462915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-11-18T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-17T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Corina Roberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ximena\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zandoval","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3604.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3680.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3781.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3884.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3990.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4057.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":536.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":591.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":525.04,"local_amount":3604.74,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3627.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615419},{"amount":536.13,"local_amount":3680.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3704.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736364},{"amount":550.82,"local_amount":3781.72,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3805.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641875},{"amount":565.82,"local_amount":3884.76,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3909.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108808},{"amount":581.16,"local_amount":3990.04,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923859},{"amount":591.03,"local_amount":4057.82,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4083.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144707}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T18:11:27Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:32:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":633389,"name":"Semsiyye","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Semsiyye is 25 year of age and single.

It is made up of nine members and is lead by a board of directors on which Se\u00f1ora Adelia is the President.  The businesses carried out by the communal association's members are varied, among them are: selling cheese, hand-crafting blankets, and cheese production.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that they are taking out will benefit the small business owners, of which Adelia is a member.  She says this is her first time as a member of Pro Mujer, having joined at the invitation of a friend who also wanted to participate in the institution.  She currently has a textile business and sells \"awayo\" cloth (a traditional woven textile with many uses), beds, etc.  She says she learned this business from her mother, since she relied on the same line of business.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will now take out is to increase her capital by purchasing wool that she will get from the communities near her home and then later use in making the products that she will sell at the request of her customers.  This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her household as much as possible since she is married and has five children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked if she liked Pro Mujer, Adelia replied that she liked the savings and the education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":1462907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-11-18T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-17T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2837.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2993},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3075.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3159.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3245},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3334.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3442.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":411.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":422.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":433.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":445.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":499.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":411.37,"local_amount":2837.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2842.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615417},{"amount":422.54,"local_amount":2914.04,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2919.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736362},{"amount":433.98,"local_amount":2993,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:30:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2998.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641873},{"amount":445.88,"local_amount":3075.04,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3080.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108806},{"amount":458.06,"local_amount":3159.04,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3165.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923857},{"amount":953.96,"local_amount":6579.04,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6591.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144706},{"amount":499.21,"local_amount":3442.8,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3449.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838459}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T22:51:30Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":633398,"name":"One Hope Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone, is very pleased to present to you members of the \u201cOne Hope\u201d group.

Rossana, who is 29, lives in this town. She is married and has one child, aged nine, who goes to school. Consuelo's husband works in a factory in Manta. In addition to being a very good mother and wife, Rossana also studies civil engineering at a university in Manta. In order to cover the cost of her studies, she decided to set up a business selling shoes and sandals door to door in her town. She also sells to her fellow students at university. She leaves her products on credit and collects payment every two weeks. She has been running her business for four years, and it has enabled her to continue her studies. Rossana is asking for a new loan, since it is indispensable to her business and to her studies, seeing as she uses the income she derives from her business to pay for her education. She will use this loan to buy shoes and sandals. She has been a member of her community bank for five years and likes it because she used her first loan to start her business. Rossana's dreams are to complete her studies and become a successful professional. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1378480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes and sandals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-11-18T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-17T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rossana Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1175.21,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":117.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":117.52,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506567},{"amount":240,"local_amount":235.04,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":240,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730325},{"amount":239.99,"local_amount":235.04,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":239.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636406},{"amount":240,"local_amount":235.04,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":240,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102765},{"amount":360.01,"local_amount":352.57,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":360.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467917648}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T17:55:57Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T12:27:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":633417,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julieta is 60 years old and has a partner and children.
