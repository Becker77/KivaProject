business making tortillas in the Rosario barrio for 12 years.  She works seven days a week from 4am, when she sends out the corn to be ground before preparing the tortillas.

The main challenge is the lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nKadiatu is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy variety of clothing to sell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her standard of living. In the future, Kadiatu plans to own a big shop.

Thanks to the skills she learned in a sewing class sponsored by her local church group, she opened her own workshop, where she offers service to customers and makes her own line of leggings. She works alone from Monday to Friday from 7:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., depending on the amount of work she has. She is able to earn enough to support her household, as she is financially responsible for everything since her husband died. \r\n\r\nWith effort and determination, she has overcome sad moments. Every day she gets up motivated by the need to keep busy and feel useful while earning enough to survive. She has applied for a loan to buy wholesale supplies (fabric, thread, elastic, buttons, and more) to make sport sets and leggings to fill orders on time and to increase her sales and income.

She dreams that in a few years her business will be positioned as the largest and best known in the area where she lives, and that she will be able to continue supporting her family.\r\n\r\nOther members of the group include:\r\nVictoriano whose business of 13 years is a grocery. \r\nAnita whose business of 10 years is a grocery.\r\nReyna whose business of 13 years is the making and selling of tortillas.  \r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras \u2013  October 2013"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1470993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase churros, soft drinks, bread, coffee, sugar, corn, beans, etc. for their business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2013-11-18T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-17T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoriano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3078.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429614565},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3078.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841013},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3078.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449730884},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3078.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459210213},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:00:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3078.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468035237},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T19:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3078.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479253427}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T15:50:00Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T19:58:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alan Carter","image":1372555}},{"id":633040,"name":"Los Cisnes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa, quien aparece con una amplia sonrisa al fondo vestida de negro y en medio de la fotograf\u00eda, pertenece al Banco Comunal Los Cisnes, de Castro.

I have two siblings - my 20-year-old older sister, and a little 8-year-old brother. I live with my mother in my grandparent's and mother's home.\n\nI started the first trimester of my civil engineering degree at INTEC. I want to take this degree because I like it a lot and also because I think it's one of the most important degrees. In the future, I want to be able to help my family and people who really need it, but given the economic situation my mother's earnings have diminished. If I don't get some help to be able to pay for university, I will need to withdraw.\n\nWhat I need and desire is that someone is able to offer me a friendly hand, and that I can achieve my dream of finishing my degree without withdrawing. After I finish my degree, I will continue to specialize. In this way I will help my community with its needs, designing work methods and teaching my industry peers that, with effort, we can meet our goals.\n\nIf I do not get this loan, I will be forced to achieve my goal and finish my studies off-schedule. In this country, by studying, we can keep advancing and modernizing up to the level of developed countries.\n\nThank you very

He has a dream of growing his small poultry business to a medium sized farm in his village so as to increase his productivity and income level.\r\n\r\nRichard's major challenge is lack of sufficient capital to boost his business and, at the same time, to look after his family. This is why he is requesting a loan of three million shillings (3,000,000 UGX). His neighbours applaud Richard for being a very hardworking, determined and dedicated man with a bright

For four years she has been offering tailoring services and with the proceeds she has been able to pay school fees for her children.

She is engaged in the farming business to provide enough food for the family. Farming is the main source of income for her family. She has learned to do this business from her parents who are farmers in Kampong Cham province. Sokorn realizes that the income from farming alone will not allow her to have better living conditions, so she currently has a new business venture of selling bananas, from which she is able to earn additional income of KHR 8,000 per day. The challenge she is experiencing in her business is the lack of a vehicle to transport her bananas to sell in the markets. For this reason, she is asking for a loan of KHR 2,000,000 to buy a used motorcycle to support her business as well as to use in her household. She hopes this loan will be granted to enable her to continue working in her business and she expects to increase her household income to satisfy her living

Ella gracias a sus padres aprendi\u00f3 el trabajo de la agricultura aprendiendo a sembrar hortalizas (papa) desde hace 7 a\u00f1os pudiendo tambi\u00e9n reforzar sus conocimientos por medio de capacitaciones recibidas en un centro de estudio ubicado en la comunidad.

Sus cultivos de hortaliza est\u00e1n ubicados cerca de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n por lo que le es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil atender sus cultivos y poder asistirlos de manera permanente. \nAlba Luz ve como \u00fanico desaf\u00edo el incremento en los precios de los insumos que ella utiliza para asistir sus cultivos de hortalizas por lo que hoy en d\u00eda solicita financiamiento para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas que ayudaran a mantener sus cultivos protegidos de plagas y al final de la temporada poder obtener una buena cosecha.\nCon esta compra ella planea extender un poco m\u00e1s sus cultivos, ofrecer m\u00e1s a sus clientes y generar mayores ingresos para su familia ya que sus sue\u00f1os son los de poder darle a su hijo una buena educaci\u00f3n y una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Alba Luz is 25 years old.  She is enterprising, a fighter, single, and the mother of a son who is young and lives at home with her parents.  She attended a year of primary school, but she was not able to continue studying since her parents lacked resources and they were not able to continue supporting her.  Thanks to her parents, she learned to farm potatoes.  Seven years ago, she was also able to add to her knowledge with trainings received at a study center in her community.  She also works selling food on Sundays.  Everyday, she looks to improve her family's living conditions and secure a future for her son.  Her crops are located close to her home, so it is easier to care for them and attend them permanently.\r\n\r\nAlba Luz says her only challenge is the increase in the cost of the supplies that she uses to care for her crops.  This is why she is requesting a loan to purchase farm supplies that will help her protect her crops from plagues so that at the end of the season she will be able to obtain a good harvest.  With this purchase, she plans to expand her crops, offer more to her customers, and generate more income for her family.  Her dream is to be able to give her son a good education and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1471053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

","en":"Abdujabbor, age 49, is an experienced carpenter, who manufactures traditional wooden cradles.  In Tajikistan, the Gahvora, a traditional wooden bassinet, is always offered to a newborn child.  Tajik people say that a baby's cradle is his whole world.  The traditional rites surrounding the birth of a child are not even considered complete until the child is offered a Gahvora by his maternal grandparents.  Traditional cradles are readily available on Tajik markets and special attention is always given when purchasing one.  But manufacturing a cradle is not easy.  It is a skill that actually takes years to be mastered.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of wooden bassinets is a tradition in Abdujabbor's family.  Every generation participates.  Abdujabbor's entire family: his wife, his three children as well as his father are involved in this craft.  Having created cradles for decades, the family has its own manufacturing secrets.  It takes two to three young poplars to make one wooden bassinet.  When the wood work is completed, it is then decorated with all the colors of the rainbow.  The cradles manufactured by Abdujabbor and his family sell like hot cakes.  Local market vendors from the town of Qurgan Tube come directly to Abdujabbor's house and buy large quantities of cradles.\r\n\r\nAbdujabbor is currently requesting a loan to increase his production of cradles and thereby expand his activity.  He plans to use his loan to buy some wood, paint and a workbench.\r\n\r\nAbdujabbor currently works from home, but in the future he would like to open his own cradle shop.\r\n

","en":"Davlatbek is a cheerful and a responsible man of 41 years.  He is married and has a child.  He lives with his family in a small hamlet.  However, the house that he lives in is small and is not very comfortable.  Davlatbek's wife is a hardworking homemaker and a caring mother.  Himself, Davlatbek works as a repairman in the town's workshop.  He has been working in this shop for a long time and is well paid.  His income is enough to cover his family's living expenses, however, he has a dream of building a large house for his family.  \r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal he needs the necessary financial means since the amount that he currently makes is not enough to build a new home.  For this reason, Davlatbek turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase building materials required to build a new house.  He is hoping for the positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1467628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase building materials to build a new home for his family","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-11-19T04:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-18T04:00:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Davlatbek ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":274},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":283.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":293.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":303.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":314.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":325.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":336.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":348.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":360.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":373.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":386.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":399.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180.86,"local_amount":851.11,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":863.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673583},{"amount":64.56,"local_amount":303.79,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":308.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144373},{"amount":66.81,"local_amount":314.42,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":318.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960192},{"amount":69.15,"local_amount":325.43,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180952},{"amount":71.58,"local_amount":336.82,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":341.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875551},{"amount":74.08,"local_amount":348.6,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":353.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302778},{"amount":76.67,"local_amount":360.81,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":365.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585579},{"amount":79.35,"local_amount":373.43,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":378.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081161},{"amount":82.13,"local_amount":386.5,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":391.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562039},{"amount":84.81,"local_amount":399.09,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":404.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694729}],"funded_date":"2014-01-16T15:09:56Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victor Khangulov","image":1437106}},{"id":633970,"name":"Phorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phorn is 39 years old and married.

","en":"Muhabbat, age 53, is a kind and hardworking woman.  She is a \"mother heroine\" [an honorary title which used to be awarded in the Soviet Union for bearing and raising a large family] and the mother of four wonderful daughters and many grandchildren.  All her daughters are now married and living independently.  Muhabbat and her husband live with one grandson, whom they took under their care because they had no son of their own.  Muhabbat comes from a very strong family in which members always support one another.\r\n\r\nThe Tajik people have always been involved in the production of traditional chests.  A young bride's dowry is not complete without a richly decorated chest which, thanks to the craftsmanship of local artisans, fascinates the eye with its incredibly fine details.  Muhabbat and her family come from a long line of such artisans who, generation after generation, have been perpetuating their craft, thus keeping Tajik traditions alive.  While Muhabbat gathers the materials necessary for the production of chests, her husband works at his bench all day, making basic chests.  Later on, it is Muhabbat and her daughters who decorate and paint the chests.\r\n\r\nRecently, Muhabbat's family has also become involved in the production of contemporary chests, which tend to be a better fit for modern interiors.  However, the materials needed for the production of these chests have to be ordered from China and they happen to be more expensive than regular components.  This is the reason why Muhabbat needs money and why she has decided to take a loan with MDO Arvand.  Muhabbat really enjoys the services offered by Arvand.  She is happy and thankful for the support she is receiving!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1466923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials for the production of chests.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-11-19T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-18T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":741.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":764.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":788.43},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":812.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":837.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":863.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":890.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":5700,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5726.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673584}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T12:21:38Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":633802,"name":"Gs.

She is 36 years old, has two children in school and lives in a domestic partnership.  Her partner works as a bartender.  She has had her shop for seven years.  She had previously studied to be a secretary but had to leave before she finished her studies.  Her store is in a good location near a school and she keeps very busy helping her customers.  However, a while back she was robbed and lost some of her confidence and had trouble keeping her business going.  Now that she is working with Namaste she hopes to increase her sales and profits.  She wants to offer a larger variety of products, especially at Christmas time, and will spend her loan money buying more stock for the store, a shelf to present her products, and repairs to her photocopy machine.\n\nWhen she started with Namaste she was working eight hours a day or about 224 hours a month, and her monthly sales were estimated at Q14,000 (US $1,818) with a profit of Q2,420 (US $314).  By the end of the loan cycle she is hoping for a 20% increase in sales, which would lead her to a monthly income of Q16,800 ($2,181) with a profit of Q2,904 ($377). \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1473396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock and a display shelf for her store, and to repair her photocopy machine.

She is married and blessed with five children. She began her business because she wants to improve her family. In 2001, Mariatu established her general stock business. She works at the business nine hours a day, seven days a week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\nMariatu requires a loan in order to purchase more items like cigarettes, biscuits, drinks, and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Mariatu plans to own the biggest shop in the community.

She is a previous client of VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She has wisely managed her past loan which she has repaid back with success to improve her living conditions and keep her kids in school. However, paying the school fee at university for her son is quite the challenge for her.

Her business experience in the area of clothing dates back to thirteen years ago when, due to the necessity of getting her family ahead, the idea of making clothing dawned to her. Buying a simple machine, she gradually built a customer base, and in addition to this activity, she added another productive business that provided her with an income. That business was the selling of \"bollos,\" or steamed corn buns, mixed with cheese and wrapped in corn husks, for which she bought a grinder and began her production. She still has these two incomes and her customer base is made up of her neighbors who buy her clothing and neighborhood stores that sell her corn buns. Carmen works from Monday to Sunday without a break, and she alone performs all of the work. Currently, she is applying for a loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy corn, cheese, salt, and pitas in bulk; she will also buy fabric and thread. She is applying for this loan to make the best investment possible during the December season when her sales from both businesses hit a high point and she wants to be very prepared in order to earn a little more.

The businesses which the members of the communal association run are varied and among them are: making blankets, selling chickens, selling blankets, selling footwear, bookshop, selling general merchandise, laundry and selling appliances.\r\n\r\nThe loan they are taking out will benefit small businesswomen of which Maria is an example. She says she joined Pro Mujer three years ago after being invited by a friend who is a member of the institution. Currently she runs a sewing business and sells chickens. She learnt the business when she was working in a workshop and then with a loan from Pro Mujer she decided to set up her own independent work space.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is taking out is to increase capital to buy fabric which she will buy from the wholesale stores in the city of El Alto and will use to make goods to sell. This kind of work allows her to generate income to maintain her household as much as possible, since she lives with a partner and has seven children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says she likes the health area."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4675,"image":{"id":1462919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-11-19T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-18T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":4675,"lender_count":148,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katia Marenka\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodrigo Fabian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":32188,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":4675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3465.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3849.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3955.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4173},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4286.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4646.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":503.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":544.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":559.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":574.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":590.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":606.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":622.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":674.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":503.33,"local_amount":3465.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3477.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615420},{"amount":544.43,"local_amount":3748.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3761.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736365},{"amount":559.12,"local_amount":3849.6,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3863.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641876},{"amount":574.45,"local_amount":3955.16,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3969.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108809},{"amount":590.1,"local_amount":4062.96,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4077.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923860},{"amount":606.09,"local_amount":4173,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4187.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144708},{"amount":622.56,"local_amount":4286.4,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4301.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838460},{"amount":674.92,"local_amount":4646.9,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4663.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264517}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T21:28:30Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T13:15:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":629985,"name":"Constructoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha es una de las tres integrantes que forma este grupo solidario, tiene la edad 32 a\u00f1os, acompa\u00f1ada, con cinco hijos bajo su responsabilidad, su negocio es la venta de comida en un puesto que tiene ubicado en el km 14 desde hace 3 a\u00f1os y medio.

She set up her business 31 years ago as an alternative means of  generating an income to support her family which consisted of her husband and 4 now grown-up children.  Her determination and hard work enabled her to contribute to her family's livelihood, since what her husband earned was not enough.  She sells her goods among her neighbours and friends and people to whom they have recommended her, and this has helped her increase her clientele.  She has been granted 21 loans by the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with whose support she has been able to make progress along with her business.  The funds have helped her to increase her working capital.  Her ambition for the future is to have a shop window and display case so that she can organise her business more, whilst her greatest challenge is to establish a portfolio of accounts to recover amounts owed more effectively and avoid losing money when selling on credit to customers who lack the ability to pay. She is currently applying for a Kiva loan which she will use to make bulk purchases of footwear, women's, men's and children's clothing and household goods (because Christmas and the New Year are coming) and she needs to have enough stock to be able to respond to the growing demand for goods at this time of year and the special prices of the supply side of the

This loan will benefit the entire co-op, which offers many services beyond selling milk, including veterinary care and an animal pharmacy.\n\nRecent truck problems have slowed their activities, and it's prohibitively expensive to hire smaller cars twice a day to transport milk from the collection center to the industry. Dukundamatungo Dairy Co-op has requested this loan to buy a truck that can handle transporting the increased milk production to the industry and ultimately reduce the co-op's overhead costs. With profits from selling milk, they will reinvest in their businesses by buying coolers and restocking their animal pharmacy.\n\nAround 90% of the Rwandan population is involved in subsistence agriculture, but many individuals have a difficult time generating money in this way without access to markets. Additionally, the income that comes from accessing markets is often the only way to pay for things like education and healthcare. Put simply, this truck allows the Dukundamatungo Dairy Co-op to turn their milk into cash, support their co-op, and better the lives of all 170

She lives in a nuclear family with her husband and children in the Angoul\u00eame II district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth-largest, administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nAssetou left school early to get married, following her parent's wishes.  She then started selling spices, seasonings and ingredients alongside her mother.  After several years of apprenticeship with her mother, she began selling fruit juice and ice.  She has 20 years of experience in this business and has very strong sales figures.  This is due to the high quality of her products, which she produces with care, and stocks in clean containers.  To make her juice, Assetou uses 3kgs of sugar, 1kg of ginger, 3 sachets of juice powder and 5 litres of water.\r\n\r\nAssetou has requested this loan from the field partner, Soro Yiriwaso, in order to purchase new equipment which will ensure the reliable running of her freezer.  This will be her first individual loan with Soro Yiriwaso, and she will use it to buy an electrical stabiliser and an electrical converter.  She buys all her equipment and ingredients locally.\r\n\r\nAssetou sells her goods for cash and credit to a mixed group of customers.  She expects to earn 50,000 francs CFA a month and will use her earnings to repay her loan and help her husband with their household expenses.

He is married, has one young child, and lives in a small rural town. He completed training to be a minivan driver, and began to work as a chauffeur. He rented a minivan and began to operate a taxi and delivery service. This has become a stable business that enables Said to earn a solid income. Said\u2019s wife is a housewife; she takes care of their baby. Said and his wife are doing all they can to provide for all of their child\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nSince Said does not own his own minivan, he has to spend money leasing a vehicle. He wants to buy his own vehicle; if he wants to expand his business, he can\u2019t afford to pay the expenses of leasing. To buy a minivan, Said needs a large sum of money. So he has turned to Arvand for a loan to buy a minivan. He thanks Arvand in advance for their support, which will result in an improved quality of life for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1467638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

After her husband died, she lived through a lot of hardship and was in great need of money, so she started her own business buying and selling milk.  She bought milk from local residents and sold it at market.  She had a small income and managed expenses with difficulty, and through it was raising her children.  She gradually developed the business and now raises cattle.  She used her income to build a barn and started to fix the house up here and there.  \r\n\r\nAnorkhon would like to finish the repairs but she doesn't have enough money to buy building materials like cement, lumber, etc., so she's seeking a loan of 3000 somoni.

Early on, he developed an interest for income-generating activities, namely the purchase, storage and sale of cereals.

The members of this communal bank have different businesses such as fast food sales, paper goods, arts and craft making and sales, and folk dancing.  Carolina has a paper goods store and also sells new and used clothing there.  She started six months ago, out of a need to be near and available to her children, so she got some savings together and was able to set up a small business.

Their oldest son is 6 years old and just finished kindergarten at the local school; their daughter is only one year old.  Together they raise coffee and she learned to work the land when she was a little girl, because her parents were farmers and taught her how to raise coffee.\r\n\r\nHer crops are located 3 km away and they walk there.  She also has two other plots of coffee and they are just now beginning to produce their first harvests.  Things that can cause her difficulties include the increase in price for supplies and the fact that the wholesaler does not pay a fair price for her coffee.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy farming supplies to aid her crops, since this has been her only source of income, which has been important to her family (parents, siblings) for many years.

Zarifa has a pedagogical education. She works in a middle school as a history teacher, but since she receives a small salary and this pay is not enough to support three children, she started her own business growing and selling potatoes and wheat. Her region is very good for growing potatoes, since the earth and climate are suitable for growing this vegetable. Zarifa is helped by her husband in running the business. <br \/><br \/>Zarifa has long been dreaming of repairing her old home, which was left by her husband's parents. She spent all her money on the fall planting. She does not have money to buy building materials to repair her home.

There are four rivers flowing through it, and it was declared World Cultural Heritage Site in December 1999. Its people are kind and courteous and work every day with different activities through which they have the opportunity to improve their economic situation. Every new day is a new opportunity to grow and improve. They keep alive the culture and traditions of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Rosa. This is her third loan together with her friends who are also members of this group. She likes this type of credit because she has the opportunity to strengthen her friendship with the rest of the members and to have a chat, since they are normally busy with work and cannot meet. Rosa is 39, married and has two children who are 12 and 7. Her first son goes to upper school, the youngest, to elementary school. Her husband is a mechanic. They live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nRosa is a stay-at-home mom. However, she contributes to the household\u2019s economy by selling cosmetics from different brands, every day and at any time if it is needed. She also weaves sweaters and purses and sells them to the same customers that buy cosmetics. She had talent for business and learned by doing.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy threads and cosmetic products that are on sale. Her goal is to have her own establishment.\r\n\r\nTwo members could not be there when the picture was taken, so their pictures were added afterwards."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4450,"image":{"id":1471206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics and threads.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-11-19T16:20:34Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-18T16:20:34Z","loan_amount":4450,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcisa De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tatiana Del Cisne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elicet Estefania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio Anibal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosa Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4443.37,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":370.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":370.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":370.83,"local_amount":370.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":370.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506573},{"amount":741.67,"local_amount":740.56,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":741.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730331},{"amount":741.66,"local_amount":740.56,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":741.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636412},{"amount":1050.37,"local_amount":1048.81,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138511},{"amount":1545.47,"local_amount":1543.16,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1545.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490833029}],"funded_date":"2013-11-22T19:14:30Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:09:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":633179,"name":"Mar\u00eda Bersabe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 70 a\u00f1os de edad,  es madre de 6 hijos todos mayores  de edad; ella no tubo la oportunidad de estudiar,  es acompa\u00f1ada  y su esposo se dedica a la agricultura, solo tres hijos est\u00e1n en casa, uno trabaja de alba\u00f1il y el otro en el tren de aseo del municipio y una hija que es enferma. \n\nMar\u00eda tiene el negocio de  la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de tamales, ya tiene 20 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a este oficio,  lo aprendi\u00f3 de la mam\u00e1 ya que ella siempre le inculco el negocio y esto de los tamales era una buena opci\u00f3n a seguir en el negocio, para que tuviera ganancias.

She did not have the opportunity to go to school. She lives with her husband and they work in agriculture. Only 3 of her children remain in her home. One son is a construction worker, the other son works on a waste collection truck, and her daughter is ill. \r\n\r\nMaria is in the business of making and selling tamales, a craft she has done for 20 years. She learned how to make tamales from her mother who always instilled that creating a business selling tamales was a good choice to remain in business and earn profits. She has no other source of income besides making chicken tamales. Her daughter-in-law helps her to make the tamales but only Maria goes out to sell them to their neighborhood. She wakes at three in the morning to cook the corn and do all of the preparations. When the tamales are all ready, she serves them as breakfast to her customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loan she has applied to from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy leaves to wrap the tamales and the ingredients for making them so she can prepare more and go out to sell more tamales. She is going to gain more clients because customers have been asking when she is going to make tamales so they can buy them and because she has experience.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help the household income as the only work done by her husband is in agriculture which is difficult. On occasion, he gets work in construction jobs which is when there is an income. She has to struggle to obtain money to purchase the medicine for her daughter who is sick.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue making tamales until she can no longer stand upright because for her it is fun for her to sell apart from the earning and income she obtains."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1471208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase ingredients to make and wrap tamales in order to go out and sell more.

She maintains the status of being a member in good standing and repays her obligations in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Lolita is asking for financial assistance of 14,900 PHP to buy additional inventory for her sari-sari store. Through this, she hopes to increase her income and expand her business. She has found assistance for her financial needs through Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative, and she is very thankful with all her heart.

He taught her everything about growing coffee and she took advantage of his expertise. After, with her own effort, she bought 2 'manzanas' of land (a manzana is about 7000 square meters). The land is located in the same area where her home is found and is cultivated with coffee, which today she is harvesting in its entirety.\r\n\r\nHer husband is her key supporter in life and on the fields, since they work together to obtain higher income to improve their economic situation and cover the needs that arise daily. \r\n\r\nMartiza Dolores aims to improve the production of her crops to ensure her children\u2019s future and to buy more property as an inheritance. Also, through her profits, she dreams of supporting her children in their studies since she didn\u2019t have the opportunity to attend high school or college.
