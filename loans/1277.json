She and her husband split because of a lack of understanding in the family. But despite this unhappiness, Zulfiya lives without ever giving up, overcoming all the obstacles in life for the sake of her lovely children. She works two jobs with all of her might to try to ensure that her children are not in need and can live like any other family. \r\n\r\nZulfiya has been working in the market selling groceries for seven years now. Zulfiya's business started with one shop, but over time luck began to smile upon her, and she has steadily improved her operation. Currently, her business is doing well. Additionally, on weekends Zulfiya works part-time as a cook in a cafe. She lovingly prepares national dishes. However, the family's main income comes from the business. Zulfiya wants to expand her business by increasing the variety of goods she sells. To develop her business, she wants to take out a loan and has applied for one from MDO Arvand.

Following her husband's death, and with children in her care, she was obliged to earn a living in order to see to her family's needs. It is for this reason that she began selling various items from her store, a skill she was taught by her late husband. With over 20 years' experience she is now an expert in her field. She learned about Soro Yiriwaso via one of the organisation's representatives, and entered its credit programme.

Irakli requested a loan from MFO Credo and the application was approved within the startup program framework that enables inexperienced borrowers to begin new businesses. Irakli owns a commercial space, and with the loan received, he will purchase essential equipment, such as a vacuum cleaner, hoses and power washers, for a car wash. He will provide services to local community members. He hopes the new business will generate income and significantly improve the living conditions of his family while giving him financial stability. With the new income he will also cover his tuition fees in order to receive a good education so he can continue to progress in life.

Her husband owns an un-stitched clothing business which is the only source of income for the family. Presently he needs additional capital for the growth of his business. For that Shumaila, as a member of a two-person lending group, is requesting a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell so that he can respond quickly to customer needs.

She has an advanced degree. She has more than 38 years of experience in farming and livestock, having started this business with only 5,000 KGS. She makes 12,000 KGS a month. Up to now, she has been able to develop both the animal husbandry and the food cultivation aspect of her farm. She has one dairy cow, ten sheep, two calves, and a plot of land measuring 3.52 hectares on which she grows peppers, beans and clover. Her husband helps on the farm. In order to further develop her farm, Barpygul approached the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 75,000 KGS to purchase cows. Barpygul plans use the profit from the loan investment to get more livestock, and in the future Barpygul would like to marry off her son.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1470779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"May village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-19T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-18T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barpygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6733},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6842},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7019},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7201},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7387},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7577},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7773},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7974},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8180},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8314}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":139.15,"local_amount":6733,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6773.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942705},{"amount":286.46,"local_amount":13861,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":13944.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553227},{"amount":146.21,"local_amount":7201,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":7244.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.61,"payment_id":459019678},{"amount":152.66,"local_amount":7387,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":7431.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053442},{"amount":156.6,"local_amount":7577,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":7622.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749577},{"amount":160.64,"local_amount":7773,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7819.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178317},{"amount":164.79,"local_amount":7974,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8022.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462929},{"amount":167.84,"local_amount":8180,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8229.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":529946943},{"amount":167.85,"local_amount":8314,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8364.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.97,"payment_id":542440298}],"funded_date":"2013-11-20T07:38:38Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":632960,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia vive en casa de unos falimiares en un acabado de ladrillo y piso de cemento en la zona de Las Lomas de la ciudad de La Paz.

The source of income for the family is small-sized money transfers from abroad where Manana\u2019s son works. In order to generate monthly income on her own, Manana decided to start up a grocery store near her house, but she found she didn\u2019t have enough money to do so. Unfortunately, Manana was unable to obtain a loan from existing financial institutions as they required business experience and stable income as a precondition to a loan. \r\n\r\nBut Manana has now received her loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides start-up and re-startup loans with easy terms for the vulnerable and poor who do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith a loan of 5,000 USD, Manana will purchase stock of basic groceries to start a store.

","en":"Nazira is 53 years old. She is a hardworking woman from a remote region. Nazira, like other local residents of her region, has been involved with raising livestock for more than 12 years. In her area, the main source of income is livestock. Nazira very much needed support when she began her business. Thanks to the support of her husband, she was able to develop her business. Now, she is an experienced business lady in the sphere of animal husbandry. <br \/><br \/>Nazira has a large garden, where she grows hay for the livestock. In this way, she gets more income, since she grows part of the livestock feed herself. The remaining part is purchased. Nazira feeds  the livestock for two or three months. At that time, she sells at the local market. <br \/><br \/>She uses the earned income for the care of her children. Nazira wants to increase her working capital. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 somoni to buy livestock and hay."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1470696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

This is a very profitable business, and he is doing it together with his wife.\r\n\r\nMohtaram is keeping a flock of sheep in his own yard.

He sells milk and yogurt to neighbors. He earns about 180 AZN a month, in part because milk, yogurt, and meat are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma, and always use yogurt. Milk products are seen as very healthy and are used daily. \r\n\r\nBecause his family has only one source of income, he is requesting a loan for 1200 AZN to buy three cattle and two milk cows.

She and her husband are raising three children.  As she was looking for a source of income to support her family, she started a small sewing business.  She makes dowries for young women of marriageable age and also sews traditional items which she sells to tourists.  She launched this business in 2009, with an initial amount of 50,000 som (KGS).  Her business is going very well, and most importantly, she loves her sewing job, from which she makes a monthly income of 5,500 som (KGS).  Gulgaaky's husband helps her with this business by ironing her finished products.\r\n\r\nGulgaaky is also involved is animal husbandry and agriculture and she owns a dairy cow, a calf, as well as 15 sheep.

From the time he was a boy, Luis has been involved in agricultural work since he helped his father with the tasks around the farm.  He learned everything about caring for animals, especially dairy cows.  Thanks to this experience, he started his own business of producing and selling milk in 1997.  Luis works alone and his main customers are his neighbors in the area where he lives.  Due to low milk prices, his business went bankrupt and he had to sell his cows.  Going through several financial crises has also affected his family.  <br \/><br \/>Nonetheless, his drive and tenacity led him to request the support of this loan, which will provide the money to buy a milk-producing cow.

Since she started in this business five years ago, she has acquired some regular customers who are always pleased with her work.\r\n\r\nBibirajab now wants to expand her activity and improve her family's living conditions, which is the reason why she is taking a loan of 3,000 USD.

He studied up to a bachelor's degree. He has worked very hard for many years to get his family ahead and give them everything they deserve. \r\n\r\nHe has a grocery store and it is his main source of income. He started his business three years ago. His business was initially started with limited capital and didn't run well enough to get much profit. His dream is to see his store flourish. \r\n\r\nDue to the current bad situation in Yemen, he has less profit from his enterprise.

She has been working as a dispatcher in a Ltd. company for the past five years.  She has three children.  She and her husband own their house.  In addition to her job, she also uses a sewing machine, at home, and she makes some money from sewing.\r\n\r\nTatyana has been dreaming about buying some bedroom furniture for her house, as the old sofa the couple uses in their bedroom is now very worn out.  She needs 5,000 Hryvnia for this purchase and, so far, she has not been able to save the whole amount necessary to buy bedroom furniture.  This is why she has decided to make her dream come true by applying for a loan from Kiva, and gradually pay back her loan amount.   \r\n\r\nIn the future, Tatyana would like to open her own sewing shop and focus more on that type of business, because she is quite good at it.

Thanks to Archagul's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 10 sheep.  The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Archagul requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a cow to increase livestock headcount.

They have rented a plot of land, where broom trees are grown. With the harvested product the family makes brooms and sells them at local markets. Teikar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her loan, Teikar will start trading clothes.

After the death of her husband, she continues to raise three children on her own. Imigulsun has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Imigulsun practices livestock breeding. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Imigulsun's hard work, she currently has on 2 milk cows on her farm. Her monthly income is 3,000 som (KGS).

Kartlos runs a pig farm and sells piglets seasonally. He works hard all day long to earn his living, but his existing income is not enough to cover food and everyday expenses. That is why Kartlos decided to start another business. He applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved under the startup loan program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva. This program enables the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $3,000 will help Kartlos to purchase a minibus. Kartlos will work on the minibus line as a driver and transport passengers from his district to the capital city. The new business initiative will significantly increase the family funds.

She lives in Nkubu area of eastern Kenya. She derives her income from the sale of  milk and crops. With farming, she loves the part where her produce is ready for harvesting which means that her hard work has been satisfied.\r\n\r\nMargaret is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kimimo, which she will use to purchase a chaff cutter which will help her livestock have enough feed and enable them to produce more and hence more income earned. She chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer low interest rates on their loans. During the training, she learned that as a small scale farmer, she should practice a culture of savings.  With the income earned from the loan, she will be able to pay school fees for her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1473264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a chuff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-11-20T16:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-19T16:00:28Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.75,"local_amount":2207,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2226.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529824},{"amount":55.36,"local_amount":4745.54,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4787.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449658277},{"amount":30.7,"local_amount":2631.39,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2654.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343619},{"amount":56.92,"local_amount":4878.99,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4922.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479165168},{"amount":29.41,"local_amount":2520.86,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2543.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859793},{"amount":32.32,"local_amount":2770.62,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2795.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287306},{"amount":31.31,"local_amount":2684.04,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2707.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570652},{"amount":61.99,"local_amount":5313.45,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5360.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054003},{"amount":26.24,"local_amount":2248.11,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2268.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547208}],"funded_date":"2013-11-20T17:48:52Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T14:46:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":634436,"name":"Levan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Levan is 34-year-old married man.

They are on their eighth group loan. Tenin, the first seated from the right to the left, expects to use her loan to buy a load of second hand clothing. She gets her second hand clothing at the grand market of Koutiala on Thursdays, the day of the trade fair. She sells these items at retail from her home and at the market to a diverse clientele. While the other members of the group expect to make a monthly profit of 106,000 f CFA each throughout the course of this loan cycle, Ms. Tenin expects to make 114,000 f CFA. Along with the reimbursement of their loans, they will use a part of their revenue to deal with personal expenses and to increase their business

Mairamkan has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Mairamkan is involved in animal husbandry, having started 10 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Mairamkan's hard work, today her business contains 6 dairy cows and 35 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Mairamkan requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows to increase livestock headcount. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's future

is 24 years old.  His name is Parviz.  He is a beginner businessman.  Parviz lives with his parents.  His parents have 2 hectares of land, where they are involved in agriculture.  A majority of the Farkhor district residents are involved in agriculture, plant vegetables, wheat, rice and cabbage.  Besides agriculture, animal husbandry is also popular in the district.  These types of businesses are in demand because the climate of Tajikistan allows for and is favorable to developing businesses in this area.  Parviz decided to get involved in animal husbandry.  He was able to build a cowshed so that his livestock would not get cold in the winter.  He bought hay and other livestock feed, and one cow.  Parviz was left with little money to buy more livestock and this is why he is requesting help.  Parviz will use this loan to buy bulls and calves.  He is not requesting a large amount because this business demands a lot of money and effort.  Parviz decided not to take a risk and started with a small amount.  He hopes that he will be supported and will receive help!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1471363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Since haberdashery and cloth fall under the same category of sewing, Amy dreams of opening a boutique to sell cloth at the same time, and to make this happen, she counts on the financial support of the IMCEC."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1472342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase haberdashery goods for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2013-11-20T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-19T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.08,"local_amount":12035.11,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":12672.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439865327},{"amount":27.93,"local_amount":12890.64,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":13573.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449754501},{"amount":57.12,"local_amount":26364.26,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":27760.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468060956},{"amount":213.87,"local_amount":98709.99,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":103938.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504416407}],"funded_date":"2013-11-24T00:30:11Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T18:42:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Martha Schmitz","image":489893}},{"id":633675,"name":"Jose Norvil","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 Norvil tiene 39  a\u00f1os de edad,  vive con su esposa e hijos, en el distrito de Cayalti, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica al cultivo de ca\u00f1a, arroz, comercio y ganader\u00eda, a dos horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n<p>\nEl brinda el servicio de transporte, trasladando a sus pasajeros a comunidades aleda\u00f1as a su distrito, tienen otra mototaxi que lo alquilan para que lo trabajen, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 3 000 nuevos soles para reparaci\u00f3n de una de sus motos y de esta manera seguir generando ingresos para su familia.\n\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 Norvil is 39 years old.

She trades in agricultural produce on a small scale and she works seven days a week. In addition to the produce business, she also buys and sells cattle at a profit, which has helped her to cater for the needs of the family. She started doing business with the hope of earning enough income which she would use to cater for the needs of her family. \r\n\r\nRose would like to use this loan (3,000,000 UGX) to buy more produce, in the form of maize and beans, to sell so that she can use the profits realized to educate her children.

Con su credikiva lograr\u00e1 una mayor variedad y comprar\u00e1 mucho m\u00e1s de lo que compra con su propio dinero, haciendo as\u00ed de su credikiva su mejor inversi\u00f3n. \n","en":"Amarillis is 46 years old and lives south of the town of Barranquilla. She has two children aged 18 and 14. She has earned her living selling a variety of goods for three years. As she is the head of the household, she is totally responsible for bringing up and educating her children and making them successful people.\r\n\r\nAmarillis buys the goods on account from merchants in the town who sell them to her at good prices. She sells them also on account every day from 9 in the morning to 9 at night. Her main customers are her neighbours and people referred to her by family members. Her sales increase daily, despite the problem she has of insufficient capital to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\nFor this reason Amariilis has approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for a loan, her first with the institution. She plans to use the money to buy personal hygiene products, cologne, candy, underwear, and other products that are profitable. She will be able to buy a greater variety than she would have using her own money, so her loan will be a very good investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1471227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy personal hygiene productsm cologne, candy and underwear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-11-20T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-19T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.41,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amarilis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":69784},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":71878},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":74034},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":76255},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78543},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80899},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83326},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85826},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":88400},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":91055}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.07,"local_amount":69784,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71642.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732253},{"amount":38.19,"local_amount":71878,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-26T09:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":73792.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415475},{"amount":39.33,"local_amount":74034,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":76005.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104608},{"amount":40.51,"local_amount":76255,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":78285.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919516},{"amount":41.72,"local_amount":78543,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":80634.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140316},{"amount":42.98,"local_amount":80899,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83053.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834199},{"amount":44.27,"local_amount":83326,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":85544.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542602},{"amount":42.1,"local_amount":79254,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":81364.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530025864},{"amount":86.42,"local_amount":186027,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":190980.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.41,"payment_id":611789377}],"funded_date":"2013-11-23T00:36:48Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:47:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":634323,"name":"Turaje Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Anastasie fait partie du groupe  Turaje et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

Kadiatu will use her share of the loan (SLL 500,000) to buy pepper, onions, Maggi, rice, groundnuts, etc. in bulk to add to her current stock. \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1470032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy peppers, onions, Maggi (flavoring cubes), rice, groundnuts, etc. in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Lunsar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2013-11-20T19:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-19T19:40:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Kadiatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Kadiatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Betty H.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Kadiatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":312500},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":312500},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":312500},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":312500},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312500},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312500},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":312500},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":312500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":321462.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439842656},{"amount":75,"local_amount":312500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":321462.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449732557},{"amount":75,"local_amount":312500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-20T08:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":321462.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459769767},{"amount":75,"local_amount":312500,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":321462.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468036937},{"amount":146.4,"local_amount":610000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":627495.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490951421},{"amount":153.6,"local_amount":640000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-20T09:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":658355.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517667288}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T23:05:42Z","paid_date":"2014-08-20T09:57:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":634405,"name":"Akouavi D\u00e9lali","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Akouavi est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9(e) de 25ans.

She sells cookery within her area, and she has been running this business since 2000. She started the business to get daily survival for her family. She works at the business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week.   Aminata says the main challenge to her business is the problem of price control in the market.\r\n\r\nAminata has requested a loan to buy food commodities like cooking seasonings, oil, and rice to prepare her cookery.  The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to open a restaurant.

After returning to his native region in Tajikistan, he has not been able to find a decent job that would pay well. Sharofat wants to help out her husband. She does not want him to leave the family again and be a migrant worker elsewhere. Sharofat and her husband decided to buy a car so that he could start working as a taxi driver.

To this day, she sewed dresses only for her children and relatives.  Now she wants to organize her own business of providing seamstress services.  Shoira is a mother of 3 children.  Her husband, Abduchabbor, is involved in growing agricultural crops.  He has a small income.  This is why Shoira is driving toward starting her business.

Maazamkhan has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Maazamkhan works with field crop cultivation, after having started 27 years ago with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Maazamkhan's persistent work, she currently has two sheep and 0.60 hectares of land, on which she every year grows potatoes, sweet corn and hay to sell.

After the death of her husband she is raising two children herself, and also has her own business. Marjanbu has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Marjanbu works with livestock breeding, after having started 35 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Marjanbu's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows and 10 sheep. The monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Marjanbu turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of calves to fatten and then resell at the market for a higher price. Marjanbu plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household

She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1473764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the spare parts and maintenance of her jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-11-20T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-19T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1453.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478977},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2907.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701379},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T09:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3633.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450029638},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2906.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459307132}],"funded_date":"2013-11-20T23:20:52Z","paid_date":"2014-03-18T08:39:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":634728,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 47-years-old, married with five children, two of whom are in school.

She owns a hairdressing salon, which she started three years ago after she finished a training program in a beauty school. Her sister-in-law trained to be a manicurist and pedicurist, and when she finished her training at the same time as Melissa, they decided to join together to start their own business venture. Today they provide beauty and hair treatments in their shop such as straightening, dyeing, highlighting, manicures and pedicures. Melissa and her sister-in-law buy their supplies from distributors in order to get wholesale prices, which they say are very competitive. Their main customers are neighbors and friends who, little by little, have referred many more people to them.\r\n\r\nThis is Melissa\u2019s fist loan with Kiva and the field partner.

She became a widow after her husband's death.  She has three children and also runs her own farm. Ainur has a vocational education. The family's main source of income is Ainur's animal husbandry business which she started 23 years ago with 5,000 KGS. Thanks to Ainur's hard work, her farm now boasts one milk cow, one bull, and fifteen sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Ainur has asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy cattle for breeding. Ainur plans to reinvest profits made from the loan into further expanding the number of animal she has. She is also planning to save money to educate her

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines against the invading Japanese.  Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They grow different crops but work as a team and they help each other on their small farms.\n\nProssy (first from left) is 30 years old and married with five children.  She has been farming for 13 years and has never yielded enough to cater for her family's food needs.  As a result of YICE\u2019s trainings, Prossy and her group members want to put the skills learnt into practice. \n\nThe group asks for this loan to enable them to buy good quality seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides as well as access more training on better farming methods.  They all believe that with the support of a loan, their yields will increase and they will be able to help their families and improve their finances.

All members in this group are small scale farmers, growing vegetables like tomatoes, eggplants, onions and green peppers which they sell in their village market.\n\nScovia (2nd from left) is 41 years old and she has been this group leader for the last eight months.  She earns her income through the sale of vegetables although she believes that she gets less than what she expects due to low and poor quality yields.\n\nScovia\u2019s group members attend YICE\u2019s trainings in farming-as-business and have acquired better farming skills so that with good quality seeds and fertilizers, their farm yields will increase.  Scovia asks for a loan to buy good quality vegetable seeds and fertilizers, and also to access more training on vegetable and other crop production to increase her yields and income so she can take good care of her family.  She dreams of becoming a model farmer for vegetable growing in her village and to the whole community, and has a vision of training other women in the
