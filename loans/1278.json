Dilovar's wife is a homemaker, and his daughter and sons attend school.  Currently, Dilovar is the only breadwinner in the family.  He decided to start his own business that he will run in parallel with his regular work.  For a while now, Dilovar has been interested in cattle sales.  He has a cowshed in his yard. \r\n\r\nDilovar saved 1,500 dollars and is asking for a loan of 2,100 dollars.  He is planning to use this money to purchase five cows, calves and some feed.  Dilovar's wife will be helping him run this business.  During his absence, she will feed and water the animals.  This loan is very important to Dilovar, since he is providing his family not only with milk, but also with a supplemental

She is 54 years old, married, and the mother of three children.  Her oldest son is currently working in Russia.  Her daughter and youngest son still live with her.  Farishtamo is a homemaker and her husband is a farmer.   He owns four hectares (9.88 acres) of land and is involved in agriculture.  Farishtamo helps him with his farming business.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of her neighbors and fellow countrymen, Farishtamo has decided to launch her own business which will consist in buying and selling livestock.  Tajikistan's main sectors of activity  are crop farming and cattle breeding.  Farishtamo is taking a loan which she will use to buy young livestock.  She will buy young bulls and calves, will feed them for 30 to 35 days and then resell them at the cattle market.  The sum that she is requesting for this loan is quite small for the type of business she is planning to launch.\r\n\r\nFarishtamo hopes to be able to reach her goals and to start her new business.  She has confidence that she will receive help, which will help her to make her dream come true.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":1471684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase livestock and get involved in animal husbandry.

With the arrival of the cold season, temperatures sometimes drop below zero.  For this reason, Stepan would like to update the heating system inside his house, to make sure that his family stays warm this winter.  His house's boiler as well as his heating system's pipes are obsolete: water is leaking through the pipes and air gets into the radiators, so they are no longer heating.  \r\n\r\nStepan needs 20,000 Hryvnia to install a new boiler and replace the pipes of his heating system.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":1472084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Therefore, she has requested a loan from TLM in amount of IDR 10,000,000 to buy the seeds of the additional  type of  vegetables as  mentioned  above. \n\nShe is expecting to generate more income from the business to help in financing to build a new house.

The positive impact of his past loans enabled him to improve his lifestyle in a gradual pace. \r\n\r\nFor this cycle, he is seeking 4,000,000 KHR in order to buy fertilizer, pay for labor cost, as well as buy insecticide for his crop.

He has many buffaloes, which is the reason he has to work very hard to arrange fodder for the herd. \r\n\r\nHis is taking a loan for the establishment of business and to increase his herd. He still wants to establish his business further and wants to buy more heifers so that he can increase his monthly income and savings as well. He decided to buy heifers because a heifer is cheaper than a buffalo and they grow up in a short time. He will feed them in a better way and he will pay his full devotions for heifers, he hopes that they will grow up soon and he can get milk from them. \r\n\r\nTherefore, M.

He has become famous by providing good quality gifts and has retained many customers. He earns enough money to support a decent life. During this tenure he experienced that most of his female customers demand for the beauty products a lot. This is the reason he decided to offer cosmetics products also with the gift hampers. \n\nTherefore, he requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner so that he could offer beauty products also with gift hampers.

He is a very hardworking man and does his best to ensure a good harvest. As the income is only seasonal, he decided to start his own business and requested a loan. The Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo enables him to get a loan of $4,000 to purchase a minibus. After the minibus is purchased, he will start a trading business.

Thanks to Azymkul's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).

years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising eight children. Almakul has a higher education. As the main source of income for her family, Almakul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 13 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Almakul's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows on her farm as well as a 4.9 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes, beans, wheat and perennial grasses annually. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Almakul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Almakul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

Her life has taken place behind a sewing machine for the last 20 years, since her mother taught her the art of dressmaking. Little by little Carmen, to keep herself in the market and to achieve high quality pieces of clothing, has studied each part of dressmaking technically and has been able to perfect what her mother had taught her.\r\n\r\nNowadays she designs, prepares, assembles and finished men's, women's and children's clothing. With this she obtains her own income, selling on credit and making cash sales with each item of clothing which the families from her neighbourhood, where she lives and works, use. Her goal is to continually strengthen her work capital and physical workspace, but her biggest challenge is having enough money to do so. This has led her to request a Kiva loan. This is her first loan cycle with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will buy fabric, thread, zips and patterns, both wholesale and retail. With this she will be able to increase her production during one of the biggest selling periods of the year for her business, as is the end of the year. This is exactly what will make her Kiva loan a good investment, with potential success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1472003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, thread, zips and patterns, both wholesale and retail.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T10:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T10:00:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78931},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":84809},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":87353},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89974},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92673},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":95453},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98317},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101266},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104304},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":107433},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110656},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":118831}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.16,"local_amount":78931,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":81481.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732256},{"amount":45.31,"local_amount":84809,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-26T09:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":87548.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415478},{"amount":46.66,"local_amount":87353,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":90175.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104612},{"amount":490.87,"local_amount":918907,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":948594.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919520}],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T21:13:30Z","paid_date":"2014-05-07T09:16:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Darby","image":null}},{"id":633752,"name":"Sandra Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La joven Sandra de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera de dos ni\u00f1as, sus estudios los realizo hasta 9\u00b0 grado, el motivo por el cual, no pudo seguir estudiando es por falta de recurso econ\u00f3mico; desde entonces ella comenz\u00f3 a trabajar en la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, ropa y yuca con fresco junto a su madre, ella tiene cuatro hermanos uno de ellos ya falleci\u00f3.

Alymkan has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Alymkan practices livestock breeding. She started this business 8 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Alymkan's hard work, she currently has 5 milk cows and 7 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Alymkan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase the size of her herd.

unmarried, and lives with her parents. Durdonokhon has a secondary education. She does farming and her parents actively help her in this business. She is a very hardworking, responsible, motivated young woman. As the main source of income for her family, Durdonokhon practices livestock breeding. She started this business one year ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Durdonokhon's hard work, she currently has 5 sheep on her farm as well as a 0.32 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes, corn and cotton. Her monthly income is 3,000 som (KGS).

","en":"Munavar is 59 years old and does an old craft, she sews quilts called kurpa and kurpacha. These are cotton quilts which are still the main household items in the homes of Tajiks. Kurpacha is put on the floor and is used instead of chairs, and kurpa is used in the winter as a quilt for sleeping. Munavar has been doing this for five years. Her only daughter helps her in the business. Munavar is married and also has two sons. She lives with her family in the region of Gafurov in the town of Khujand.\r\n\r\nMunavar's service is always in demand. Especially when people hold wedding celebrations they make kurpa and kurpacha as a dowry for the future bride or their daughter who is getting married. This is why Munavar's business is growing day by day and now she needs a loan. Munavar wants to buy cotton to sew a large quantity of cotton quilts.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1472894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She has three years experience and, with her children, who study culinary art, it has occurred to them to practice what they've learned taking into account the products most consumed by their target market. Due to a lack of employment, they decided that her son would generate his own family income supporting the business with the first capital with which they have done very well. Their sales are made in cash from 4 in the afternoon until 2 in the morning from Friday to Sunday and when it is a holiday. They make their purchases at wholesale and make sales directly to their neighbors in the area who are their main customers. Her future goal is to open a restaurant where she can add many more products that her son has learned in his studies in order to expand their income and be able to support her family as much as possible. Currently, she is applying for a loan, the first loan she's made with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy four sets of plastic tables and chairs and ingredients for fast food such as sausages, sauces, dairy fat,etc. With this investment, she will achieve better service for her customers and respond to the enormous demand that approaches in the months of November, December and January, the holiday season, when students and many members of their families are on vacation and consume a lot more of the delicious fast products that are prepared in Zulisma's business, which means her loan has potential for success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1472008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

At the same time he performs agricultural work. Ana stayed in school up to the ninth grade. With this preparation she fends for herself in her daily work. She left school to help her parents with farm work and, later, accompanied her current partner. Her two children live with her. The eldest is in the fourth grade. She has a small store in the area's school. She sells breads with chicken, candies, natural juices, among other products. Previously, they had given her work as a seller in a small shop but she preferred to have her own business. For ten years, she has had this business in the school. The business is located a block and a half from her house and she works there from Monday to Friday. \r\n\r\nAna needs the loan to invest in the purchase of more items to stock her business to sell from her house since the school year has ended and she doesn't sell in the school anymore. For that reason, she wants to invest in this business taking advantage of the holiday season. In this way, she will be able to keep working and receiving income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe wishes that her business expands and that this can generate sufficient income to cover the basic necessities of her family, that her children can continue their education and go to university which will allow them to have more job opportunities or start their own business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1472016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy items needed to install a shop in her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":39.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":47.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":49.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.46,"local_amount":35.46,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":35.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716493},{"amount":38.28,"local_amount":38.28,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":38.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622127},{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":38.96,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":38.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088353},{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":43.07,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902608},{"amount":33.54,"local_amount":33.54,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":33.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215827},{"amount":40.65,"local_amount":40.65,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":40.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817186},{"amount":82.79,"local_amount":82.79,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":82.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525752},{"amount":187.25,"local_amount":187.25,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":187.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008263}],"funded_date":"2013-11-23T07:08:17Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:16:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":633763,"name":"Servelio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Servelio, tiene  43 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casado, tiene tres hijos y vive en el municipio de Choloma, Cortes.

She is married and she and her husband have three children living with them. The oldest is 22 years old and only studied in primary school because she did not like school. From an early age, this daughter learned to do household chores and to be involved in the activities of harvesting coffee. Her son is 20 and is currently studying at a higher level, in his first year of medicine. During harvest season, he becomes involved in the activities of the coffee harvest. Her third child is 17 and is in high school studying arts and sciences. She is in her last year of high school and, like her two siblings, is involved with the activities of the coffee harvest. Do\u00f1a Leyla has earned her living growing coffee for 20 years and obtained her knowledge from her husband as he is also a producer of coffee. The property the family works is located 2 miles for her house. She gets there by walking.\r\nLeyla's goals are to buy more property to continue growing coffee to improve their living conditions by planting more coffee plants so she can get more revenue to continue to support their children in their studies and to strengthen the estate for them. Today she is requesting funding to purchase agricultural inputs to assist her coffee crops and get a bumper crop at the end of the season which will help to fulfill their goals and dreams.

Initially, he worked in agriculture, in the production of organic cocoa in his neighbourhood, with his wife and children. However, after he was widowed, he saw the need to opt for the job that he had learned as a youngster: panel-beating and painting, and doing vehicle paintwork. He started this business more than 15 years ago, and it has served him well in making a living. Each day, various owners of damaged vehicles come to his business, which is located at the back of his home.

Mukhavat has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Mukhavat is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 15 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Mukhavat's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 horse and also a 0.30 hectare land plot, where she grows beans, potatoes and perennial herbs. The monthly income amounts to 5,000 som (KGS).  Mukhavat is part of the \"Kireshe\" group that consists of two more people.  She is the leader of this group.  In order to further develop her business, Mukhavat requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a heifer to increase livestock headcount. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to repair her

positive and responsible woman.  She is married and has three children.  She lives with her family in a small village, but the house where they live is small and not completely suitable for a good living in it.  She is a very hardworking and caring mother.   Barohat works as an orderly at a local labor and delivery hospital.  Besides the primary job, she also works part-time as a salesperson at a market.  Barohat's husband is ill and unable to work, and this is why she has to work a lot in order to have an income in the family.  However, what she earns is only enough for living expenses.  With the help of her children, Barohat very recently built a new small house, but now she has to complete the roof for it.  She needs money for this.  This is why Barohat came to Arvand and wants to obtain this loan to purchase construction materials for building the roof.  Barohat hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1467642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He is a very efficient man because, aside from caring for his family, he likes to work and thus help his family. His business is selling clothes, which has been his sole source of income for over one year. He started his business selling articles of clothing in the market with limited capital.\r\n\r\n At the present time, his business does not make a big profit due to the difficult situation in Yemen.

He learnt the business from his friend who has the same business. Yesid saw that it was very profitable and had gone very well for his friend. So when he asked him for help to learn the same business, his friend did not hesitate to help him and also put him in contact with lots of suppliers, to make sure Yesid's investment would be successful. Now he has a shop where he works from Monday to Saturday from 9 in the morning until 9 at night. His main customers are people in the district around his shop and the surrounding area. His challenge is to become much more well-known and in future to open another service centre in order to make more income.\r\n\r\nCurrently Yesid needs to buy a larger quantity of accessories and spares for mobile phones and so he has approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva loan. This will be his first loan with this organisation. With his Kiva loan, he will be able to increase the range in his shop and drive his sales, with appropriate stock for the high demand of the year-end. During this season he will be able to attract a lot of customers, making his Kiva loan into a successful investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1472031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a larger quantity of accessories and spares for mobile phones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesid Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83435},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76488},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78783},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":81146},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83581},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86088},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88671},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91331},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94071},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96893},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99800},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89713}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.7,"local_amount":83435,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":84457.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732258},{"amount":34.52,"local_amount":65897,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":66704.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919522},{"amount":471.78,"local_amount":900668,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":911702.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542606}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T17:51:46Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":634931,"name":"Jenelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenelyn is 32 years old and married with four children.

The man on this photograph is Ramazon.  Despite is age (49 years old), Ramazon wants to start his first business.  He will be involved in animal husbandry.  Ramazon is not afraid of difficulties and big changes.  He selected this business because Tajikistan has a favorable climate and clean air, which will allow livestock to grow faster and healthier.  Taking advantage of the favorable nature of his country and work experience in this sphere, Ramazon is confident in his fortune.  He has had 2 cows for about 3.5 years, but used them for his personal needs.  Now Ramazon has serious intentions and requesting this loan to buy several more heads of livestock.  He is requesting this loan because he does not have enough for the starting capital since this business requires a lot of money.  Help Ramazon!

To provide additional income for her family, Guliya is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 7 years ago with 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Guliya's hard work, today her business contains 1 sheep and a 1.86 hectare land plot, where she grows potatoes, corn, barley and sainfoin. The monthly income amounts to 14,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Guliya requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a cow to increase livestock headcount.

Al hallarse casi al final de su campa\u00f1a productiva desea contar con capital de respaldo para proceder con la cosecha de sus productos y por ello es necesario contar con el firme apoyo de trabajadores del lugar.\nSus objetivos a largo plazo apuntan a la compra de un vehiculo moto carguero con el cual espera reducir los costes de traslado para sus productos desde sus parcelas hasta los centros de acopio en su localidad.Este es su cuarto pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva y se siente agradecida por el apoyo financiero que recibe para seguir adelante, adem\u00e1s se compromete a pagar sus cuotas de manera puntual.

She and Vladimir are farmers and raise cacao and organic coffee and have been doing so for more than 15 years.  They eventually adopted it to become the family\u2019s main source of financial support.  Early every morning, she goes to her farmland, where she and her husband weed and fertilize the crops so that they can have better quality products at good prices.  Because she is nearing the end of her production, she would like to have some working capital so she can hire workers for the harvest.\r\n\r\nHer long range objectives are to buy a motor freight vehicle with which she hopes will reduce her transportation costs for her products to the local supply centers.  This will be her fourth Kiva loan and she is grateful for this loan which will allow her to continue moving forward.  She also promises to make her payments on time.  She is asking for a loan of 1,000 New Soles so she can hire local workers and continue little by little with her cacao harvest and recover the money she invested in the current campaign.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1472037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T18:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T18:40:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Migna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":107.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":114.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":117.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":123.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":128.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":131.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":136.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":140.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.33,"local_amount":107.54,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":112.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091905},{"amount":43.1,"local_amount":114.94,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-03T10:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":120.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778510},{"amount":43.92,"local_amount":117.13,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":123.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598911},{"amount":46.18,"local_amount":123.13,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":129.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147784},{"amount":48.28,"local_amount":128.76,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":135.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240875},{"amount":49.33,"local_amount":131.53,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-03T10:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":138.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258314},{"amount":51.24,"local_amount":136.66,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-01T11:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":143.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491502393},{"amount":52.62,"local_amount":140.31,"processed_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-25T12:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":147.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504306361}],"funded_date":"2013-11-22T21:42:40Z","paid_date":"2015-07-25T12:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

living through clothing sales. Specifically, she goes to Turkey to buy apparel and household items in bulk which she then sells for a profit to her community members. Since there are not many clothing stores in the area, Ana's products enjoy high demand. She is very nice to her customers and does her job with love and care. \r\n\r\nAna has applied for this loan in order to buy a stock of merchandise at wholesale prices to enlarge her business.

She works at the market and sells vegetables.  Her daughter-in-law recently learned to be a seamstress from a local seamstress.  However, she does not have her own sewing machine in order to take orders for women's dresses.  Toshguloy would like to help her daughter-in-law to open a sewing business and is asking for a loan.  She will use the loan amount to purchase a modern sewing machine.  Toshguloy's daughter-in-law will sew one dress per day.  This is a profitable business because sewing services are always in demand in Tajikistan.  Women purchase fabric and then custom order their traditional dresses.  Toshguloy believes in the success of her daughter-in-law's sewing business and this is why she plans to help her.

He started this business some years ago, encouraged by his parents, who sold perishable goods at the city market. He gradually built his business selling clothing, though today he sells toys.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to grow and diversify his business.

He is married and has one child. Uygun lives with his wife in a small house in a rural area. He is full of energy and desire to work to improve his family\u2019s situation. Uygun raises cattle. He has been collaborating with Arvand since 2012 and has shown himself to be a responsible client. He received his first loan to buy cattle for the first time, and he still continues this business. At present he owns 20 heads of cattle. He has a land plot where he puts his cattle out to feed. His wife helps him in this work. The livestock business brings in a good revenue, and so Uygun would like to continue developing it and increase his headcount. This is why he turned to Arvand for a loan to buy cattle. Uygun thanks Arvand in advance for its support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1468233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase

wife. Kadyrbai has a secondary education. Animal husbandry is the family's main source of income. Kadyrbai started this business 18 years ago by buying cattle with 5,000 KGS. Thanks to Kadyrbai's hard work his farm boasts one dairy cow, a calf, three goats, and a plot of land measuring 2.53 hectares where he grows barley and corn. He earns a monthly income of 15,000 KGS. Kadyrbai is a member of the group \"Almali\". This group includes two other people. Kadyrbai is the leader of the group. In order to further develop his farm, Kadyrbai has asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 75,000 KGS to buy sheep for breeding. Kadyrbai plans to use profits he makes from the loan to further increase his herd and to save enough money to buy a family

Cirilo's dream is to be able to give an education to his children and they can improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":1461643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep and turkeys","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Ana Nichi, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victorina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abimael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1096.88,"local_amount":14250,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":14280.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644492},{"amount":731.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":9520.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877953},{"amount":731.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9520.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766983},{"amount":365.62,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4760.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247785}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T22:42:49Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":628151,"name":"Renovaci\u00f3n Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo \"Renovaci\u00f3n\" se encuentra ubicado en una comunidad hermosa y muy grande se caracteriza por tener vecinos muy responsables y respetuosos es una comunidad con grandes festividades como el dia 2 de Febrero es cuando celebran a su patrona del pueblo La Virgen de la Candelaria.

It is a community which celebrates huge festivals such as 2 February, when the town's patron saint, the Virgin of the Candelaria, is celebrated. The group is made up of five women and two men, who chose the name of the group themselves, because they had previously belonged to another group named Granada, but when it separated they had to start again, which is why they named themselves \u201cRenovaci\u00f3n\u201d, meaning renovation in Spanish. \r\n\r\nCarmen is the group's representative. She is 47 and is married to Zenaido. They have been together for 26 years and have a family together with five children, two of whom already have their own children who study. Carmen has made a living raising and fattening pigs for 24 years, almost the same amount of time that she's been married to Zenaido. She decided to start this business because she wanted to help out with household expenses. While Zenaido worked, Carmen raised and fattened pigs, which made it easier for them to pay the household expenses. These increased when their children decided to study, which is why she continues to work in this. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion, she is requesting a loan from Vision Fund and Kiva to buy feed for her pigs. Carmen explains that \"I fatten them for four months, and then sell them. We can't keep them any longer because they eat a lot and the feed is very expensive\". A while ago, Carmen's pigs used to get ill and die, which was a problem for her because they represented a loss of earnings and investments for the for the family. However, the situation has now been resolved, because Zenaido learned how to vaccinate them, deworm them, etc. to avoid such large losses.\r\n\r\nCarmen's only goal is to continue supporting her children's studies. One is them is about to finish his degree to become a successful vet. She says \u201cI'd hate for my son to have to abandon his degree halfway through because of a lack of money\". Like Carmen, the group is very grateful to and happy with Kiva and Vision Fund for the loan granted, because it will give them the opportunity to invest in their businesses. Gregoria, Sergio and Clara will invest in their pigs, Albina in her chickens, Rafaela in costume jewellery and \u00c1ngelin sheep."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":1460790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy food for their pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T22:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T22:20:16Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rafaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sergio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":731.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9520.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644494},{"amount":731.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9520.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877955},{"amount":1096.88,"local_amount":14250,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":14280.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449766985},{"amount":365.62,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4760.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247787}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T23:27:02Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":635016,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda, who is married, works hard to support her family.

She has been engaged in the planting, growing, and selling of coffee for over 8 years as her parents taught her to work the land she inherited from them. Today, she works serving her clients, residents of surrounding areas, and brokers, among others where she lives.

Gulsana has a higher education. She works as a lead social development specialist. To make extra money for her family, Gulsana also works in animal husbandry. She started ten years ago, buying cattle with 15,000 KGS. Thanks to Gulsana's hard work, her farm currently boasts one milk cow, one mare, three calves, and a plot of land measuring 0.30 hectares where she grows peppers, potatoes, and clover.

She plans to graduate in December 2015, but without a loan from Vittana, she thinks that she may need to take time off to work and save until she can return to school. With this loan, Ruth plans to purchase her much-needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Ruth feels she will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. With a career in law, she expects to earn $10 a day, a substantial increase from before.

Aipara, needing an income, started a small business making traditional clothes with an investment of 20,000 KGS. Business is very good, and most importantly Aipara takes pleasure in her sewing work. This gives her a monthly income of 15,000 KGS. Also, Aipara works in animal husbandry and farming. Her farm has one dairy cow, a calf, five sheep, and a small plot of land where she grows potatoes, tomatoes and corn. In order to expand her animal husbandry business, Aipara approached the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy sheep for breeding. Aipara plans to use income from the loan to expand her livestock and plans to save enough money to build a new home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1473001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy

Her oldest child is in secondary school and the two younger children are in primary school. She finished secondary school with a diploma in Science and Humanities. \r\n\r\nAlong with her partner, she works in agriculture. She is also a businesswoman, selling food in a small cafeteria in the community where she lives. Along with her coffee plants, this has allowed her to provide for her children and cover the household's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nCoffee is a particularly delicate product, and if she does not have the necessary supplies in time, she can lose the entire harvest. Therefore, she has applied for a loan from Comixmul which she will use to buy twelve quintals of fertilizer, twelve quintals of urea, and ten quintals of coffee formula, among other supplies. She will then be able to keep her coffee crops safe and healthy.\r\n\r\nHer long-term goals are to expand her coffee crops by buying more land, to plant a more competitive variety of coffee, and to make her crops more technical.

Due to inadequate capital, she is asking for a loan of KHR 2,000,000 to buy construction supplies needed for constructing a latrine and paying for labor costs. \r\n\r\nThanks to the water loan program offered by HKL with a special interest rate, she is encouraged to focus on healthy living conditions, safeguarding the health of her family, and protecting the environment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1471709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy construction supplies needed for constructing a latrine and paying for labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.5 104","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T23:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T23:40:11Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chantha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1040025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517554497},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1040024.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649582321}],"funded_date":"2013-11-22T05:52:07Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:58:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":630902,"name":"Merisyl","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Merisyl.

She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she started 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, her holdings now include three milk cows, three calves and 22 sheep, with a monthly income of 10,000 KGS.

She learned about BJS and applied for a loan to buy seeds and fertilizers for cultivating potatoes on their own land. She is very hopeful that the cultivation will be very profitable, as there is a great demand for potatoes in the local market.

He has lived in this community since he was four years old. He says that he has made quite a bit of effort to grow professionally. In spite of all the sacrifices, he continues studying, as his desire is to be someone in life in order to help his parents and serve in his community. His work is in the fields from Monday to Friday; he works with his father in agriculture and raising cattle. On the weekends, he studies on Saturdays because he is finishing his university degree, and on Sundays he works as a teacher and gives classes to students in the first and second year of secondary school.\r\n\r\nIn the community where he lives, they don't have electricity, which means that he and his family cannot do other work at night. He says that they use candles at night for lighting, which makes him feel sad because he thinks that he could take advantage of time at night to read, do his work for the university and plan his classes. This is why he needs a loan for a solar system to bring electricity to his home, which would change his life and that of his family.
