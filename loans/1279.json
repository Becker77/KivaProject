She produces organic cheeses, which have a high nutrition content that includes calcium, protein, and phosphorus.  At the same time, they lack the nutritional problems usually associated with cheese such as high levels of saturated fats, triglycerides, and saturated fatty acids.  The first step that she took was not to keep the cows locked up or enclosed far away from the pastures where they like to graze.  In addition, she does not cut off the horns since the calves were born that way.  The food she gives them is fresh and of high quality.  <br \/><br \/>Julia Clara lives in her home in the community of Achica Baja, which is in the Viacha sector of Ingavi Province in the Department of La Paz.  It is approximately a two-hour trip from the city of La Paz.  Her loan will be used to buy a pair of dairy cows of improved breed so that she can obtain milk of the best quality.  This will be used as the main ingredient in the production of organic cheese, which is how she currently makes her living.   <br \/><br \/>Julia Clara\u2019s dream is to grow and eventually have an organic farm of her own that is self-sustaining and operates with the use of bio-digesters and biogas.  This equipment requires that her cows produce at least 12 kilos of manure per day, which is mixed with 60 liters of water.  The mixture provides enough methane to last for four hours each day, which prevents the emission of carbon dioxide into the environment.  <br \/><br \/>This is the third time Julia Clara has requested

","en":"Edison, 22, is a young entrepreneur living with his parents.  He completed secondary school and lives in San Rafael La Capilla that belongs to Otavalo in Imbabura Province.  This is a place with much tourism.  Most people living around him work as craftsmen making and selling reed mats.  Edison sells these mats in the city of Napo.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s been doing this since the age of 15 having learned from his parents who also sell mats.  He stopped going to school in order to go into this business because the lack of economic resources made staying in school impossible and now with the business he\u2019s been able to learn much and also help at home with basic household expenses and utility costs.\r\n\r\nHe works from 5 in the morning until 6 in the evening going through the streets in the city to sell from street market to street market.  Moving about has always been difficult because he must carry his merchandise on his back; he sells mats of various sizes.\r\n\r\nThe mats are made from \u2018totora\u2019 [texture of sedge, flags, or rushes] and depending on their size can take up to two hours to weave but they are very attractive to tourists.\r\n\r\nNow Edison is asking for a loan to increase his merchandise for the Christmas season in which sales tend to improve to increase business and meet household needs and also to pay debts he has.  Edison is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and to Kiva for giving him the opportunity of continuing to increase his merchandise and to increase sales thus improving his life

district of Jalpaiguri. Her family consists of her husband, Sahidul, and three children (two sons and one daughter). They live in their own kaccha house (mud and straw-made). \r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Nilufa and her husband are illiterate and can only sign their names. Their children are receiving education. Their two sons are in class X (grade 10) and class VIII (grade 8) respectively, and their daughter is in class VI (grade 6).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. They have a plot of land where potatoes are usually grown. She and her husband work hard and always have high-quality products, which are sold to local retailers. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the income is only seasonal, the earning is not sufficient to maintain their lifestyle and the expenses of their children's education.

This area is known as the heart of Ecuador because of its geographic location, but it should be noted that the economic situation isn't so good. Because of this, Jorge had to move to the city of Latacunga with the aim of finding better work opportunities and ended up putting down roots in the city. He finished his primary education with a lot of hard work and self-sacrifice. Jorge is married and with a lot of effort and self-sacrifice he and his wife were able to build their own house on a plot of inherited land.

She is married to Mario and has 3 children, but she only lives with one of them in a house built from adobe. She has always been associated with agricultural and livestock and growing organic cacao because as a child she grew up at her parents' side helping in the smaller tasks. As the years passed by and when she became an adult she inherited some land when she got engaged to Mario and she started to work that would characterize her in the future as she forges more wellbeing for her family. Her main work is mostly maintaining her organic cacao plants with a series of tasks to optimize her final production. This ranges from replacing old plants with a technique called grafting to applying organic fertilizer that helps give better nutrients reflected in the pods that are finally sent to the area collectors. This is her fourth Kiva loan and she feels grateful for the financial support  she is receiving to get ahead. She is also committed to make her payments on time.

El primer paso que di\u00f3 fue no atar a las vacas, ni mantenerlas encerradas lejos de los pastisales en los que les gusta pastar, tampoco cortarles los cuernos, para que, \u00e9stas den terneras de forma natural y el alimento que proporcionen sea fresco y de gran calidad. \n\nElla vive en casa propia ubicada en la comunidad de Achica Baja, del Sector Viacha de la provincia Ingavi, del Departamento de La Paz, aproximadamente a dos horas de viaje desde la ciudad de La Paz.\n\nIsidora solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un par de vacas lecheras de raza mejorada para obtener leche de mejor calidad y producir queso ecol\u00f3gico en mayor cantidad.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Isidora es crecer y a mediano plazo, contar con su propia granja ecol\u00f3gica, la cual sea autosostenible y principalmente con BIODIGESTORES y BIOGAS, para lo cual se requiere de ganado que proporcione al menos 12 kilos de estiercol diario, que mezclados con 60 litros de agua, proporcionar\u00e1n Metano por 4 horas diarias, evitando as\u00ed la emanaci\u00f3n de di\u00f3xido de carbono (CO2), para el cuidado del medio ambiente.\n\nEs la tercera vez que solicita cr\u00e9dito junto a IMPRO y la segunda vez con KIVA.\n","en":"Isidora is part of a group in her community that decided to take care of the land and the animals. She produces organic cheeses, which have a high nutrition content that includes calcium, protein, and phosphorus. At the same time, they lack the nutritional problems usually associated with cheese such as high levels of saturated fats, triglycerides, and saturated fatty acids. The first step that she took was not to keep the cows locked up or enclosed far away from the pastures where they like to graze. In addition, she does not cut off the horns since the calves were born that way. The food she gives them is fresh and of high quality. <br \/><br \/>Isidora lives in her home in the community of Achica Baja, which is in the Viacha sector of Ingavi Province in the Department of La Paz. It is approximately a two-hour trip from the city of La Paz. Her loan will be used to buy a pair of dairy cows of improved breed so that she can obtain milk of the best quality for producing large quantities of organic cheese. <br \/><br \/>Isodora\u2019s dream is to grow and eventually have an organic farm of her own that is self-sustaining and operates with the use of bio-digesters and biogas. This equipment requires that her cows produce at least 12 kilos of manure per day, which is mixed with 60 liters of water. The mixture provides enough methane to last for four hours each day, which prevents the emission of carbon dioxide into the environment. <br \/><br \/>This is the third time Isidora has requested a loan from IMPRO, but the second time through

She is married and has three children between 16 and 28 years old, she said. Only two of her children are in school, and they all live at home. \r\n\r\nWith a  little money from their club (monthly savings), she was able to establish this cook shop business two years ago. She sells for eight hours each day in her business, from Monday to Saturday. Some problem she faces is a small income, since she wants to buy more fish, meat, pepper, onion, rice, etc., for her business. Her plan is to one day to build a modern house.

For more than 9 years, she has worked in the emergency room of a local hospital. She works as a dispatcher.  Ten years ago, Mavlyuda lost her husband. Since then, she has had to work alone to provide for her children. She worked in the field during the day, and at night worked as a nurse at the hospital. This way, she raised her children. Her son became her only support. After high school, he enrolled in the University, but the family's difficult condition has forced him to leave for Russia.

","en":"Bozorgul is a cheerful lady.  She lacks a university education, and has been working for more than 14 years at a local hospital.  As a widow raising 4 children, she is the breadwinner for her family, and, at times, has trouble making ends meet.

cheerful young man. He is married and has two children. Burhonjon and his wife have a happy life together and try to raise their children to be good people. He and his wife take pleasure in bringing up their children. \r\n\r\nTo make an income to cover their living expenses, Burhonjon practices his beloved occupation. For ten years already, Burhonjon has worked as a taxi driver. He has his own car for this purpose. However, this car has served him for a long time already and has needed to be repaired many times. This is why he is now planning to buy a new and improved car for conducting and expanding his taxi business. This business brings in good earnings for Burhonjon, but its only enough for his living expenses. \r\n\r\nIn order to buy a new car, financial resources are required. For this reason, Burhonjon turned to Arvand. He wants a loan to buy a new car for use in his taxi business. He hopes for a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their

She is married and has grown-up children. She is an entrepreneur and has a retail shop at the local market. She sells women's and men's shoes as well as clothes for women and children. She started her business in 1996. To the present day, she continues to develop her business and receive an income. Her husband and son work in Russia. Every month they send remittances home to the family. Her other son works as a taxi driver in his own village. He has a stabile income from this job. \r\n\r\nNow Nazokat wants to help her eldest son get married. She is currently working on preparations for the wedding ceremony. But all of the money which Nazokat has already saved is not enough to completely cover the wedding expenses. This is why Nazokat turned to Arvand to receive a loan to buy a dowry for her son's wedding. She thanks Arvand in advance for their support.

","en":"Dinara is a young and determined woman. She was born in 1989. Dinara is unmarried and lives with her parents. After graduating from secondary school, she did not attend university as her parents did not have the money for it.

","en":"Abdusattor is a positive and hardworking man who is 47 years old. He is married and has three children. He has partnered with Arvand for several years already. The first loan Abdusattor received was to develop his own business. He started a business breeding livestock. His wife does not work. She is a homemaker and looks after their children. In order to have a good income which will be enough to satisfy all of his family's needs, Abdusattor works at his business. He raises and sells cattle. He also sells the milk which he gets from these cattle. Now he wants to expand his business, increase the size of his herd and then receive a bigger profit so that his family can have enough financial resources to cover all of their family expenses. He hopes that this business will help him improve the economic situation of his family. This is why Abdusattor turned to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to buy more cattle. He thanks Arvand in advance for the financial support.

As a mother, her goals and dreams are to support her children in their studies, so that they can go to university and graduate as good professionals with better life opportunities.<br \/>Therefore, she is now requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies for looking after and maintaining her coffee crop, which she hopes to sell at a good price.

She was able to buy the ingredients needed in her business. She sells banana cue and other snacks made of rice. Her loan is helpful not just in her business but also in the education of her children. Her income from business is supporting their everyday expenses at home. She is planning to buy a pisonet machine, a computer mounted and assembled in a safe wooden box with a timer which determines how long a player sitting in the seat in front of the machine will be using it.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan so she can buy bananas, sugar, charcoal, oil, milk and other ingredients for her business. She will also use the loan as additional capital in buying the pisonet machine. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMia hopes that her business will continue to flourish and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

She previously accessed a 25,000 PHP loan that she used to buy additional stock of toys and other products. Her earnings were a big help in her personal, household and business expenditures. She also has a pisonet machine, which is a computer mounted in a wooden box with a timer that determines how long a player sits in a seat and uses the arcade-type machine.\r\n \r\nNoemi would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan for her to buy more stock of charcoal and use as additional capital for her frozen products. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nNoemi hopes that her business will continue to be successful and dreams of good health.

She hopes she can earn 200,000 IDR each pig per month. Now the price for one superior piglet is 400,000 IDR.\r\n\r\nNi Kadek and her family feel the benefit from the pig program and she\u2019s very thankful for that. She hopes she can support her children's  education until university and make sure they can have a bright future.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1474650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy three superior piglets to raise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2013-11-22T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-21T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":12000000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12219478.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490868113}],"funded_date":"2013-11-22T20:32:29Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T15:34:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":635386,"name":"Wanawangurumo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magreth, who is in her early twenties, is married, with a boy who is in school. \r\n\r\nFor three years now, Magreth has been running a tailoring business.

She was unemployed for a number of months and, because of this, her family had financial problems, with Sandra's husband's salary not being enough to cover household costs.  Sandra therefore decided to start her own business: a bargain store, where she sells clothes, kitchen utensils, items for the home, and more.  She started this business a few days ago and it has provided her with a sufficient income to be able to help to stabilise the family's finances.  Sandra's perseverance, drive, and her constant efforts have helped Sandra to get ahead.  She is now applying for a loan in order to buy merchandise (blouses, jeans, underwear, kitchen utensils, and more) in bulk.  With these products she will be able to increase the variety of products she offers and can satisfy her customers' needs.  She will be able to increase her sales and her profits.  With these profits, Sandra tells us that she would like to improve her business and make it a profitable source of income which helps her to improve her living conditions and give her children a good upbringing and better well-being.  Moreover, Sandra dream of opening other stores in the future, in order to provide jobs to people who need it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1472162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural

As an additional source of income, he has a bodaboda (motorcycle transport) business that operates in the local area.  In farming, he faces the challenge of lack of enough capital to run the farm.\r\nMartin chose Juhudi Kilimo because their services are easy and affordable, and they offer low interest rates on their loans.

She owns an adobe home that she shares with other family members. She also has a business selling food from a location which she rents, which she has had for more than 6 years. She tells us that at the beginning she only had basic knowledge of how to prepare different dishes, but that through the demands of her customers she learned how to improve her cooking. Today, this has enabled her to have a lot of business, particularly with agricultural labors and transportation workers in her area. She is very grateful for her work because of the close relationships she has with her clients. She treats them well which enables her to establish these relationships. Luisa's long term goal is to improve her home so that she can later run her business from where she lives in order to avoid paying rent. \r\n\r\nThis is the third Kiva loan that Luisa has benefited from, and she is very grateful for the financial support that has allowed her to continue to get ahead. She has always paid back her loan installments when due. Currently, she is asking for a loan of 1,000 soles to buy wholesale ingredients for her food preparation, including rice, sugar, and grains, among others.

Four of them are now grown, and the youngest is 15 years old and still in high school. \r\n\r\nMariana works selling sheets, comforters, and pillow cases, which she does so she can earn money to support herself and provide for her home. She sells these products door to door. She also makes sweets and delicious caramels, which she distributes from her home to various salespeople who will sell for her or to individuals who want to try her sweets (which are known for being the most delicious in her area). She has been doing this for over 20 years, which has helped her to raise her youngest son. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is currently asking for is to buy sheets and comforters, as well as to buy the provisions she needs to make her sweets. She has been a member of this communal bank group since it was started, and is grateful for the continuous help she receives with her loans. Her dream is to give her children a better life.

Rocafuerte is known for the delicious sweets its residents prepare, which are recognized throughout the country. \r\n\r\nBeatriz, one of the group members, is 23 years old. She is married and has an 8 year old son who is in school. Her husband works as a driver.\r\n\r\nBeatriz works selling clothes and all kinds of accessories in order to earn her own income and help support her family's needs. She sells her merchandise door to door, and also sells goods from her house where her clients will go to make their purchases. Part of the loan she is asking for will be used to put a concrete floor in her home (it is currently made of dirt), so that her clients have a better experience when they come to her home.

He tells us that because of his family's poor economic situation, as a child his parents could no longer afford to send him to school. He is married, and his wife works in the home. They have five children who are all married adults, but he and his wife live with two grandchildren (10 and 12 years old) who they are in charge of taking care of. Both of these children are in school. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has worked in agriculture his whole life, planting basic grains, which he learned to do from his parents when he was little in order to help sustain the family economically. He continues this work to this day. In addition to agriculture, he also works as a day laborer, to support his family with additional income. To get to his jobs he has to walk 2 kilometers, which takes him 30 minutes. He receives help from his family and children with his crops. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is asking for is to collect his corn and bean harvests, and transfer the seeds and store them in a place where they will be kept safe. This will allow him to have a better quality seed and ensure a greater production of corn and beans for the rest of the year. He was in danger of losing his harvest if he didn't collect the seeds on time, but thanks to the loan he has received he is ok. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Jos\u00e9 wishes to improve his quality of life by having a better house. He will improve his harvests and provide a better standard of living for his children and grandchildren. He wants to watch them grow, continue to study, and be the people that society needs. He hopes that this loan will help him to get ahead, and that future loans he receives will allow him to grow his harvests and possibly even export them.

Ergash has a higher education but is not able to find a good job in his field. His wife doesn't work outside the home, but takes care of their home and children. Therefore, in order to have a good income that will be sufficient to cover all of his family's needs, Ergash runs his own business in animal husbandry, fattening and selling cattle. He began the business not long ago and is now working on expanding it to increase revenue. His two older sons also help out - they are working as migrant labourers in Russia and every month try to send money to their parents. \r\n\r\nErgash hopes that his business will help him improve his family's financial situation. Therefore he has turned to Arvand to request a loan to purchase several head of cattle to develop his business.

Together, they have come to SMT\/Kiva lenders to apply for a loan of 19,100,000 Sierra Leonean leones (SLL) in order to meet their most immediate and pressing financial needs. Some will use this loan to buy a plot of land for the future construction of a dwelling house, some will use it to buy house building materials, and others will use the loan to invest in business and to pay school fees for their children. At the end of each month, they can easily repay the loan using their salaries. It is their school\u2019s bursar who is directly responsible for doing the deductions and making the repayments on their behalf.\r\n\r\nDaniel, who is pictured on the left, is the featured leader of this team of teachers.

Uganda. She is married and has three children with two of them currently in school. For the past 15 years, Florence has been working hard to manage her salon business, which deals in hair dressing and the sale of braids.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 2,500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more braids to sell, and will help Florence to generate greater profits to take care of her children. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to start another business venture.\r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Florence who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

He feels really excited to expand his business by selling mobile phone airtime credits and serving bill payments. For the last  month, he has around $ 10 - 15 per day in sales on average (just mobile phone airtime credit sales). Recently, he took a loan from KIVA to get a printer  to support his business selling mobile phone airtime credits and serving bill payment (household electricity payments).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1475016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile

","en":"Yulchi lives in a village near Kanibadam, where raising livestock, breeding chickens and other domestic livestock and farming are the primary types of occupations of the local residents.  He has three children and supports his elderly parents.  His wife and parents help him with breeding livestock and farming.  To support his large family, Yulchi works part-time building houses.  His dream is to provide a decent education for his children.  Animal husbandry is the main income source for the family.

Since young age, she has been entrepreneurial and capable young woman.  She always found an occupation or work that yielded a profit and was able to spend money for her needs.  She found a grocery outlet and started her own business.  Her merchandise consists of various children's goods, toys and some sweets.  At first, Mahina had a small selection of goods, but she gradually expanded her selection.  Today, her business is successful and brings her a good income.  Thanks to her drive and desire to work, Mahina wants to expand her business, but does not have enough money.  This is why she decided to come to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to purchase an inventory of children's toys for future sale.
