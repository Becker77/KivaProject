child. Hasan has owned a fish shop for twenty-five years. He sells all kinds of fish, depending on the season. Hasan requested a loan of 1000 US dollars from Al Majmoua in order to purchase a new refrigerator and do some maintenance work in his shop. This is the first time that Hasan has requested a loan.<P>\r\n\r\nHasan is special in his work because he fishes for different types of fish; his shop is clean as well.

Ruth, 37 years old, is hard working lady and the leader of Kibuye United group in Mubende. She is a farmer and, at the same time, a business lady. She is involved in the sale of produce that she buys from fellow farmers, in addition to what she gets from her own farm. She has been operating her business from Nyabuhula village for 6 years and, at the moment, she is able to make profits amounting to 400,000 UGX a month. She also buys goats and sheep for resale. The good quality of her animals and other produce attracts more customers to her business. Ruth has a dream of buying a car that will help in transporting her goods.

is married with four children and lives at Ngyen-Mbo, Cameroon. Frederic and his entire family live in a house with two rooms.\r\n\r\nFrederic had to overcome some challenges in life such as ill-health, untimely death of family members, and inadequate funds to take good care of his family. He operates a palm oil production business with the loans given to him and people also pay him to process palm oil for them.\r\n\r\nFrederick has been a member of GHAPE since 2001 and this will be his eighth loan. He has been quite successful in the past with his business due to his location, and he is trusted by his customers. Also, with the experience he now has, many people are coming to have their palm oil processed.\r\n\r\nPart of Frederick\u2019s profits from his loan will be used to take care of his children, buy necessities for the family, and give them good medication whenever they are sick. He will use part of the profits to save as a precaution.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":403206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Since her children were working and going to school, she was able to focus on selling to her acquaintances.  Then, she called upon Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, thanks to a recommendation from a neighbor, who gets loans from this organization.  She used the financing to increase her working capital and establish a credit history.  This, in turn, made it possible for several companies to offer her their products and she has been able to diversify the products she offers.\r\n\r\nHer dream for later on is to buy a public

For 20 years, he has been growing potatoes, peas, corn and various vegetables. His partner works with him on the land and his children also lend a hand, as he always keeps his plots well-tended. He prefers to sow in just the right season, not too early or too late, otherwise it is difficult to remove the weeds from the plots, because when he irrigates them they grow alongside his crops. Farming work is quite profitable for Jos\u00e9, because it has allowed him to acquire various personal assets such as his house, farming land and other possessions. This is why he doesn\u2019t intend to stop working the land, but also intends to set up a grocery store business in his house, since there is no other similar business in the area he lives in. This is the first time he has requested an MFP loan, and he is very grateful to everyone who has made the money available for him to continue working. He says he is also impressed by the achievements of the members of his communal group, who work to pay their quotas on time. Jos\u00e9 plans to invest the money requested in the purchase of several sacks of fertiliser to spread on his crops, since he has the advantage of irrigating his plots, and in this way he hopes to continue making progress.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Stansfield, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":565980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertiliser to improve the quality of this crops ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-11T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":847.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195434}],"funded_date":"2010-07-11T20:39:18Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate Stansfield","image":null}},{"id":217602,"name":"John John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John John D. is from the village of Manaoag.

SPBD's loans are her only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and, since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/community\/viewTeam?team_id=8375\" target=\"_blank\">SPBD's lending

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and an abaca weaving businesses. Her husband Joelito, who is 45 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have three children who are 10 to 23 years old. Pilarina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Pilarina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,200,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy stocks of products for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Pilarina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari store, pig fattening and a pedicab business. She has eight children who are 33 to 49 years old. Basilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Basilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

As a housewife, Dewi needs to take care of her children while running her fried rice business.  Her husband works as a seasonal construction worker who earns about $45 per month.  However her husband's income is not enough to support their family as they need to spend $45 for living expenses and $25 for children tuition (their other kids in Java).  Dewi sells her kiosk from a makeshift kiosk and tent.  She sells fried rice in front of her rented home.  She earns about $5 per day.  She plans to use the loan to increase capital.  Hopefully she can expand her business so she can better fulfill her family's need and tuition for her 4 children.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nDewi Komala tinggal di rumah kontrakan bersama suami dan 2 orang anaknya.

Suaminya bekerja sebagai kuli bangunan \u2013 yang baru bekerja apabila ada proyek. Pendapatan per bulannya mencapai Rp 450.000,00. Penghasilannya saja tidak mencukupi untuk kebutuhan mereka. Per bulannya, mereka harus mengeluarkan Rp 450.000,00 untuk biaya hidup dan Rp 250.000,00 untuk biaya pendidikan anak (2 anak mereka yang di Jawa).

She started with 200 PEN, and she has been in this business for a short time.  She hopes that it will go very well.  With help from her significant other they bought a cart called a salchipapero (apparatus fitted with gas fryers and various compartments to conserve hot fried foods).  Then, little by little, they are buying utensils and materials to offer better service to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe currently continues selling salchipapa with chicken outside of her house where there is plenty of movement.  She is doing very well in her sales.  She starts selling at 5:00 on the afternoon.  That is when many customers want to taste an appetizer.  She waits on them with kindness and her characteristic charisma.\r\n\r\nWith the loan for 1,000 PEN she wants to buy chickens, sacks of potatoes, packages of oil, and some kitchen utensils to replace the ones she currently has.

Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fabrics & materials. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase used sewing machine. This loan will be the tenth loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":452573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a used sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Rizal, Lapaz Tarlac","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2009-12-19T13:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":409}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.39},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.39},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":18.77,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":875.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110616488},{"amount":9.38,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":437.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110616489},{"amount":9.38,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":437.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110616490},{"amount":9.38,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":437.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110616491},{"amount":178.09,"local_amount":7915,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8309.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118015252}],"funded_date":"2009-12-19T16:23:13Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T10:11:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":167877,"name":"Morn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Morn K. is 48 years old.

S. is a young woman of 22 years.  She lives with her small son in the hamlet of Ca\u00f1o Negro situated in the canton of Los Chiles in Alajuela province.  The hamlet is located in mountainous terrain and is very near the northern border of Costa Rica.  Farming and agriculture are the area\u2019s main economic activities, with staple grains, sugar cane and oranges as the principal crops.  Recently, Elizabeth managed to secure a job in a hotel, but reports that getting to and from work is difficult as a result of the hotel being of considerable distance from her house, local roads being in poor condition, and few public buses.  To solve the issue of transport and to be able to save on time and money, Elizabeth has decided to buy a moped.  Therefore, she needs a loan of \u00a2654 (six hundred and fifty four Costa Rican Colons) to buy the moped and to provide her own means of transport.  Elizabeth is part of the Communal Credit lending company Emcrecoba, one of the 100 organisations affiliated with EDESA in Costa Rica.  This is Elizabeth\u2019s first loan.  Elizabeth expresses thanks to these types of organisations and credit facilitators, as they make it possible for her to focus on more productive activities.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

He is very well known in his work because he knows the city\u2019s various neighborhoods very well and can offer very good taxi service.  His wife, Elena, is a nurse and they have two, school-aged children.  They live in the Alto Pampahasi neighborhood.  (The Pampahasi area, located on the east side of the city, is considered to be a residential and tourist area.  It has grown dramatically in the last nine years, which has meant improved living conditions for its approximately 30.000 residents).\r\n\r\nFrom the entrance to the area, a point called Segundo Cruce, abutting Villa San Antonio, one can see imposing buildings that are up to four storeys tall, many of them with finished facades, as well as wide, paved streets; added to this are planters and recreational areas.\r\n\r\nThe area encompasses 16 neighborhoods in three sectors: Bajo Pampahasi (Illimani-San Juan), Centro (Cancha Venus) and Alto (Said-Cruz Pata, ex SAMAPA and La Guardia).\r\n\r\nIt has 11 educational establishments:  one private, two church run and the rest are public.  It has three markets, the main one being 10 de Noviembre, located in Pampahasi Central, which is 20 minutes from city center.\r\n\r\nRen\u00e9 has been in this line of work for more than five years.  He is asking for funding to replace the transmission gear box on his taxi because it has had a few problems recently.  He hopes to repair his taxi as soon as possible so that he can continue to work as he has done so to date.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

All of them live in their own homes.  Some time ago, she set up a business renting pool tables from a small section of her house.  Her other business is that of dressmaker, an activity she engages in sporadically.  This way, Gloria attends to her customers, offering good service to the young people who play on her premises.  This has paid off in earnings, for which she is proud.  For this reason she wishes to improve her facility and playing equipment, such as cue, billiard balls, and some well worn tables.  She would thus be able to offer more financial stability to her family.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she commits to being punctual once more in her payments.  With the money requested, she will buy cues and billiard balls, and invest in fabric to start up her dressmaking business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva

She is married and her husband is a school teacher with a decent salary. Montaha has a grocery store located in an active area where she lives. she wants to purchase large amounts of groceries for sale such as: rice, sugar, flower...etc, but she does not have enough extra money so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Montaha takes the loan which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to buy  groceries so she will have in the store a better collection of inventory for sale. Montaha will increase her income and provide better life conditions to the family. Montaha is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

De F\u00e1tima Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cVirgen D. F\u00e1tima\u201d is a rural community bank in FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari project, which provides credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, such as being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cVirgen D. F\u00e1tima\u201d is located in the small community of La Merced in the province of Churcampa, at over 9,000 ft above sea level. Currently the bank has completed 2 loan cycles after just one year of existence.  Currently there are 20 female borrowers. \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the bank, during their one year in FINCA Peru, besides having learned to be responsible and punctual, have learned to respect each other and to help another member of the group when they face some kind of difficulty. At each bi-weekly reunion a different member of the group prepares a small meal that she will sell for 1 sol (about 35 cents U.S!), and the profit she will add to her savings in the bank.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group was able to save over 4,900 soles (about 1,600 US$) in the first 2 loan cycles and will continue to save in the future.  For all members, the main use of the savings is for investing in their business or for the education of their children.  Another dream they have for the use of their savings is to be able to make renovations to their houses, like constructing another floor or changing the roof to a more sustainable material.\r\n<p>\r\nMost members of the community bank run the same business: they have fields with corn, wheat and peas. And a little bit lower down at the Mantaro river basin, where it\u2019s a little warmer, they grow fruits like oranges and mango.  There is one special fruit they cultivate: the fruit of the tuna-cactus. As all of these product are seasonal, they also have mountain goats and minor animals like chickens and guinea-pigs. Most of the products they sell weekly at the local market of Churcampa or a little further away in Huanta. Two also run grocery stores in the community. \r\n<p>\r\nThe loans range from 200 soles, 500 soles up to 600 soles and the total of the loans reach 5,100 soles among the 20 members. The amounts of 500 and 600 soles are exceptions.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough many dedicate their time to the same business, every member has a different testimony, as is the case of Perpetua Murga A.. Perpetua was the woman that formed the bank in its first cycle and was elected the first president. With her 600 soles loan she will buy new supplies for her grocery store. And with her 450 soles of savings she will hire someone to make holes in the ground to put new tara and tuna-cactus plants\r\n<p>\r\nMarcelina M. V. will invest her 200 soles buying plants of the tuna-cactus and of tara. Both need time to grow before they get productive (tuna 1 year and tara 3 years). Meanwhile she will depend on her mountain-goats: the sells them for the meat, but also she makes cheese from goat-milk."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":117372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy new inventory for grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-01-19T15:35:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perpetua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Octavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Livia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anatolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edmunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Dometila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillerma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tereza Fortunata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-02T20:09:09Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-03-02T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147454},{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-04-02T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":171740},{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198975},{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225885},{"amount":292,"local_amount":850.97,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":861.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255228},{"amount":290,"local_amount":845.14,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-02T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":855.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283962}],"funded_date":"2008-01-19T20:09:09Z","paid_date":"2008-08-02T09:13:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":36507,"name":"Ny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ny S. is a 45-year-old grocer.

Rahmonkul is 56 years old, married, and has three children. He has secondary education and has an animal husbandry business. He has a small cow house where he breeds calves. Because he does not have a specialized education, animal husbandry is the only source of income for his family. Rahmonkul buys calves on the market at a low price, feeds them and then resells in the same market at a more profitable price.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her neighbors and acquaintances hold her in high esteem and consider her to be a trustworthy woman.\r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to provide her son with a quality education that will guarantee him a promising future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":506671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Fundo Santo Tomas - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133.07},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":129.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":140.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":141.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":145.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":152.98},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":156.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":161.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":167.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":171.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.79},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.24},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.79,"local_amount":133.07,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":137.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934687},{"amount":47.54,"local_amount":129.66,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":133.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662309},{"amount":51.7,"local_amount":140.98,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":145.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695013},{"amount":51.94,"local_amount":141.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":145.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878058},{"amount":53.29,"local_amount":145.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:44Z","rounded_local_amount":149.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618086},{"amount":56.09,"local_amount":152.98,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":157.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832488},{"amount":57.32,"local_amount":156.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":161.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099095},{"amount":120.58,"local_amount":328.85,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529984},{"amount":62.75,"local_amount":171.14,"processed_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":176.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666143}],"funded_date":"2010-03-15T21:40:35Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":188956,"name":"Ronald","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronald is a 31-year old teacher.

A la question de savoir pourquoi elle a choisi Turame, elle a r\u00e9pondu que Turame donne un cr\u00e9dit sans demander des garanties mat\u00e9rielles comme le font les autres institutions de micro-finance.

She is 30 and was able to attend school through 6th grade. She is married and the mother of five children, three sons and two daughters who are 15, 12, 8, 4 and 18 months. Only two are enrolled in school. She is in good health and affirms that she has no problems in life. \r\n\r\nAs a banana juice saleswoman, she chose to take out a loan from Turame because she was incapable of continuing her work with financial support. \r\nShe has just finished repaying her first loan of 100,000 Fbu. Her present loan request is for 180,000 which will be used to buy bananas. Asked why she chose Turame, she replied that Turame gives loans without requiring collateral the way other microfinance institutions do. She can't therefore leave Turame until she is financially independent. \r\n\r\nAs for her business, she gets up at two a.m. to prepare the banana juice which she then brings to her little juice stand. She only goes home when she has finished selling her juice. Normally, she never has difficulty selling all of it every day. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to have a happy life, both physically and materially. As for her children, she wants to be able to send them to school so that they also become able to live comfortably. She hopes to open a general store after her second loan with Turame is paid off. In conclusion, she encourages others to request loans through Turame, since Turame does not require anything before it gives out loans. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Habibulo is 48 years old. He is married and with his wife they are blessed with 3 children. Habibulo makes a living planting vegetables and wheat. In addition to this farming, he also raises cattle to provide extra income for his family. \r\n\r\nSince Habibulo lacks financial resources, he is hoping to borrow 9000 Somoni so he can purchase additional farm inputs to cultivate his farm and plant vegetables. Some of this loan will be used to pay for laborers who will help him plant the crops. Some will help pay for food to sustain him and his laborers during their work. Habibulo wants to sustain his farming business and hopefully grow it so he can eventually have a hectare of farmland to cultivate and provide for the future of his family.  \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

For her, then, it\u2019s most advantageous to keep in stock acceptable levels of each.

Her success resides in pushing higher profits with a low-cost loan to attain opportune response from customers who she cares for so that she can attain the growth she aims for.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":925571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T20:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":115234},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":149034},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":152512},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":156070},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":159712},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163438},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167252},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171155},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":175148},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":179235},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":183417},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":227793}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.5,"local_amount":115234,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":115913.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188718},{"amount":78.24,"local_amount":149034,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":149913.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324930},{"amount":80.07,"local_amount":152512,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":153411.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038986},{"amount":81.94,"local_amount":156070,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":156990.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651136},{"amount":83.85,"local_amount":159712,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":160654.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140739},{"amount":85.8,"local_amount":163438,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":164402.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100650},{"amount":87.81,"local_amount":167252,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":168238.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338266},{"amount":89.85,"local_amount":171155,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":172164.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394849},{"amount":91.96,"local_amount":175148,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":176181.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774688},{"amount":309.98,"local_amount":590445,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":593928.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386678}],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T20:36:23Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:17:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":365191,"name":"Edralin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edralin is a 36-year-old married woman with four children.

She has a house made of adobe.  \r\n\r\nHighlighting the good seasoning she has, she decided on her own to get started selling food in a district street fair in her town.  For 10 years she has been working alone on the weekend because it's a day when country people go to the city to do their weekly shopping and give themselves a little extra pleasure.\r\n\r\nShe's very comfortable in her job because she's an expert in preparing some traditional dishes of her region, including \"puca picante\" [potatoes with a beet-peanut sauce], \"caldo de mote\" [a corn soup], and others.  Even so, standing up and constantly moving is somewhat tiring at the end of the day, but with the satisfaction of having given the best variety of food.  Her guests constantly come to her stall in gratitude for her good service.\r\n\r\nTo continue working smoothly she plans to acquire ingredients and supplies such as rice, sacks of native potatoes, and other products wholesale so she can get discounts and raise her final profits.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to start building her house of concrete and brick because she has land on a corner in her neighborhood and thinks that, because it's on the corner, there would be enough people for a small food business.\r\n\r\nShe feels at peace because now she can work more smoothly and invest with great enthusiasm.  She's grateful to her communal bank colleagues for their warm welcome.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan.  With the 500 nuevos soles [PEN] she'll supplement her capital for buying bags of rice, native potatoes, and other supplies to continue with her business.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1253180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, native potatoes, and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frusila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":59.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":69.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":537536,"name":"Anela Lina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Angela es una mujer de 33 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Pucallpa con sus dos hijos, a quienes ama y son su principal raz\u00f3n en la vida, ella es una persona muy amable, trabajadora y entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por sacar adelante a su familia, ya que ella es padre y madre para sus hijos; lamentablemente por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos y por la necesidad que tuvo de trabajar desde muy joven, Angela no pudo estudiar la carrera profesional de Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas que deseaba, en sus ratos libres le gusta pasear por las acogedoras y calurosas calles de su ciudad y en algunas ocasiones cocina un riqu\u00edsimo Tacu Tacu para compartir con si familia.\nPor iniciativa propia, con mucho empe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n, Angela trabaja en su peque\u00f1o negocio de venta de abarrotes, ella trabaja todos los d\u00edas por un aproximado de 12 horas y cree que le va bien por los buenos precios y por el trato amable que brinda a sus clientes.\nAngela se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestamistas Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada podr\u00e1 realizar la compra de mayor cantidad y variedad de mercader\u00eda, como arroz, az\u00facar, leche, menestras, dulces, golosinas, gaseosas y otros, de esta manera Angela tendr\u00e1 su negocio mejor abastecido y podr\u00e1 atender a mas clientes, as\u00ed pues ella seguir\u00e1 trabajando y esforz\u00e1ndose para lograr su gran sue\u00f1o de brindar una buena educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos y desea verlos convertidos en buenos profesionales.\n","en":"Angela, 33, lives in the city of Pucallpa with her two children who she loves and are the main reason for living.\r\n\r\nShe is a very nice, hard working and enthusiastic person who devotes all her efforts to getting her family ahead as she is a single parent. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately due to a lack of economic resources and because she had to work when she was very young, she was unable to study Business Administration like she had wanted to. \r\n\r\nIn her free time she likes to stroll through the cozy hot streets in the city and sometimes she will cook a delicious Tacu Tacu [Peruvian steak, rice and beans dish] to share with her family. \r\n\r\nBy her own initiative and with much effort and dedication, Angela has a small grocery store.

G. has always been a hard-working man, who has made sure, from his young age, that his family never goes without their daily bread. He is a widower with one son. He has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuffs such as sweets, soft drinks, juices, and other items. <P>\r\n\r\nWith a starting capital of 100 USD, thanks to his perseverance and dedication, he began this enterprise 4 years ago, in order to support his son and parents. To this date, he is the only support of his son and parents.

Since that was going well for her she decided to expand her business, and thought about adding a food store, with a small storage area.

The elder is Rocky, 25-years old and already married, while the younger is Rachelle, 19-years old and presently a college student in Tuguegarao City. Rosefina is thankful that her son sometimes still extends them financial support even though he has his own family to look after. \r\n<p>\r\nRosefina is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP that will be used to expand her direct selling business. The money will be used to purchase more products to sell in order to earn more profit. She is hoping to increase her business income in order provide her daughter with a good education and allow her to finish her college courses.

Saidahmad is an ordinary man in the district of Rudaki in Tajikistan. He is a very responsible person who since his youth has been running a livestock farm with the goal of supporting his family, his wife and 3 children. Saidahmad needs to purchase calves and goats to reproduce them and maximize his profits by selling their milk and meat. Once he has these products from his flock he sells them in his neighborhood and in this manner he is able to support his family. For this reason, Saidahmad is turning to you for the support that would permit him to continue developing his business.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is in a common-law-marriage, and she lives with her life partner in her mother-in-law\u2019s house.  She has two children, ages three and one and a half.  They are her motivation for getting ahead.\r\n\r\nShe works in her grocery store.  She has a small grocery store.  She buys wholesale in order to be able to sell for retail and get income that way.  She works at home.  She has been in this business for three years.  She works alone because he life partner works at a saw mill.  That way they both generate the income needed for their household. \r\n\r\nThis work is going so-so for Roc\u00edo.  She is maintaining her grocery store; she still needs a lot of things in order for it to be stocked.  What she likes about her grocery store is that there is always action.  What she does not like is that there are people who come with the desire to ask for credit.  They are the ones who are late in paying, and they weaken her business.  Later she hopes to be able to have a store that is stocked like she always had.  That way she will have more income.\r\n\r\nThis is the sixth loan that Roc\u00edo has had with the MFP institution.  Her mind is at ease in the group because they are all considered to be good.  She is very grateful for the opportunity that MFP gives her in order to be able to invest and generate income for her household.  She will use the requested 2,000 soles to buy groceries and ornamental trim for clothing for her business.  That way she will be able to grow together with her business.

She is married and has 8 children between the ages of 25 and 45, all of them married.\r\n\r\nMaria left Inhambane for Naamacha, a neighboring village on the boarder of Swaziland, with her husband who was a police officer in Macuacua, a town 7km from the village.\r\n\r\nMaria started her own business raising guinea fowls and selling them at the village. She was able to buy a car with the funds she raised and the help of her husband. Having a vehicle to work with, allowed them to expand their business and start selling charcoal in the capital city of Maputo.\r\n\r\nBut, due to the war, Maria lost all her assets and moved back to her village, where she continued her business, with difficulty. After having a conversation with her son who was already a member, she requested a loan to rebuild her business selling chickens.  She is very grateful to Hluvuku and Kiva for having provided her with the amount she requested. She was able to buy 5x100 crates of chicks at 28.000,00MT and resell each bird at 100,00MT, having a profit of 8.000,00MT. She is able to save 2.000,00MT a month because she has to support her grandchildren who are attending school.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria's third loan with Hluvuku and her second loan with Kiva. The 20.000,00MT that she is requesting will be used to grow her businesses. She is confident that she'll be able to pay her loan back without any problems and later on request a new loan, because besides having her business she can also count on her husband's help.<br

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and money shortages never defeated Rano, who has always looked for a way to get past obstacles and continue to improve her situation. Rano is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 40 years old, widow and has a child. For more than 7 years, she has operated a store where she sells kid\u2019s clothing. Her store is well known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful. Rano hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her dearest child. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more clothing to sell. With this purpose Rano requests $2500 USD. She promises to repay the loan in time and thanks everyone supporting her.      \n \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Considera su negocio rentable, ya que no tiene que salir de su hogar y por ende se ahorra gran cantidad de pasajes entre otros gastos. El \u00fanico problema es por la ma\u00f1ana, cuando debe cerrarlo para ir al mercado a hacer compras o llevar a sus hijos al colegio. Pero gracias a su empe\u00f1o las ventas son buenas y cada vez tiene mayor cantidad de clientela, es por ello que piensa seguir esforz\u00e1ndose para alcanzar todas sus metas y en el futuro piensa ampliar su negocio y construirlo de material noble, ya que en la actualidad es de madera. \nEste es su tercer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, ella menciona que nunca ha sido irresponsable, por eso est\u00e1 satisfecha con la labor de los miembros de su banco comunal, pues todos pagan puntualmente sus cuotas. Con el dinero que solicita comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s productos para surtir su tienda.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":403494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-11T03:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":204.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997647},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":204.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842999},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":613.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734575},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":204.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992511}],"funded_date":"2009-10-21T00:07:37Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":147261,"name":"Vaifoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vaifoa P. is a 38 -year-old woman.  She lives in the town of Faleasiu.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  To make a living, Vaifoa owns & operates a business in the agriculture sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Vaifoa has been engaged in this business for over 4 years.  From these activities, Vaifoa earns approximately $500 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vaifoa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Vaifoa is requesting a loan from SPBD.  A previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She is now requesting a new loan of $1500 WST.  The current loan will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Varifoa from SPBD.  Vaifoa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nVaifoa is not affected by the tsunami which hit Samoa on 9\/29\/09. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

After harvest, local residents will be able to purchase wheat, onions, and potatoes at a lower price than they would pay at the market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the commune of Rugombo (Cibitoke Province).   Her husband is an elderly farmer; she sells kerosene which is used in many rural households for kerosene lamps. This is a business that she has been in for one year, whereas she just lived from farming before that. She was able to rise above the physically demanding work of farming thanks to Turame.  \r\n\r\nCassilde is the mother of 8 children, three daughters and five sons, of whom two are already married. Three of them are students, but she is also responsible for the school fees of two other children, one of whom is an orphan from her family. She hopes that her children will be able to finish their studies successfully so that they can help her when she is old. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she is counting on adding to her working capital and her business, by buying kerosene in bulk to grow her income and thus be able to cover her day-to-day expenses for food, school fees, and other household costs. Since she sometimes sells on credit to some of her customers, she affirms that she sometimes has trouble with late payments from these customers. \r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for Turame's and Kiva's initiatives since no collateral is needed in order to request a loan, contrary to banks and other microfinance institutions. She is a member of the Ubumwe II group, which means in translation \"United\", and she is on her second loan with Turame. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Pakistan. Khanewal is famous for its shrines. She lives in a two-roomed brick house with her family, and she moved here with her family 30 years ago. Zaib is 56 years old, married to M. R., and the mother of five children \u2013 three sons and two daughters. Her four children are receiving an education except her eldest son who completed his education until 10th standard and couldn't continue further studies due to financial constraints. He now works as a property dealer in a company.  \r\n<br>Zaib's husband is a rickshaw driver. He has been in this business for the last five years and it enables him to manage his children's education expenses. His eldest son contributes financially to his family as well in order to keep things running smoothly. Zaib has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband because he has problems driving his rickshaw. With the loan, he will repair its engine and give it a new look by replacing the old seat covers with new ones.

The roads are bad, and because the markets are outside, the rain can really disrupt the sales.\n\nMichel is excited to be taking his 1st loan with Esperanza after having heard about the success of others and the growth of their businesses. He plans to use this loan to invest in his business of footwear sales both in nearby Dajabon, Dominican Republic, and other communities in Northern Haiti. He will use the profits to continue to grow his business and help pay for the education and benefit of his family. In the meantime he plans to continue enjoying the work that he does in his church and community.\n\nThis Esperanza associate\u2019s story is representative of his group and of Esperanza's Haitian clients generally. His group is located in Ounaminthe, which is the town on the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of Haiti, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

She is married and has two children, 2 and 7 years old.  \r\n\r\nChristiner owns a business that sells kanga and vitenge, traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women. Kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a piece of cotton fabric with wax print, printed using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Christiner needs a loan of US$125 in order to start a new business venture by opening a stand that would sell Coca Cola and other drinks that are popular even in the most remote villages in Africa. The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing; therefore, selling them has become a popular business venture. Chistiner thanks everyone for their support.\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: \r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her first child is already in university. Leonida was married, but her husband's family was upset that she did not give birth to more boys and chased her from her home in Nairobi. She is now suing him. <P>\r\n\r\nLeonida now lives in Manyatta slum, but she works in Nyamesaria. She runs two businesses, a beauty salon and a tailoring shop. Her challenges right now are too few customers. Her hopes for the future are to help her children so that in the future they can help her too. She likes running her own business, because when she makes a profit, it's hers and hers alone. She thinks women make better entrepreneurs because men often use the profits for drinking and being idle, a common refrain amongst many of the K-MET borrowers.<P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me (Kiva Fellow) greet Leonida saying \"Idhi Nade,\" which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Leonida responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as President Obama's father. At the end,  you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo, saying \"Asante sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you,\" and \"Erokamano,\" which, in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are those of people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting.

Only one child still lives with him and his wife.  Since he was very little he has been planting citrus fruits like oranges, tangelos, and tangerines.  These products are very profitable for him, especially in summer time when they are in great demand in the capital city of Lima.  Therefore, for each trip he prepares 40 or 50 boxes to sell.  He sells them for 12 to 15 soles per box.  That is how he gets very good earnings.  Thanks to that, he was able to educate all of his many children; they lacked nothing.

She lives in her own house with her three children:  Nely, 23, Abel 21, and Nelly 9, who are the motivating force in her life.  Her grocery store is in the La Capilla neighborhood (an important neighborhood in the city of Juliaca).  Her store is one of the better stocked stores in the area so it is very busy.  Ceferina rises very early to tend to her customers since her main customers are residents of the area and they all start their work days very early.  What she likes most about her work is chatting with her customers and learning about the goings-on in her neighborhood.  She has been in this line of work for 15 years and feels that the hardest part of the job is withstanding the intense cold common in the mornings when she opens up for business.  For later in the future, she would like to enlarge her store so that she can offer better customer service.  This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is very happy to have gotten it.  She knows that she must invest the money in her business so that it will be more productive.  She is a very active member of her communal bank.
