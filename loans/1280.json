He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine and a maize de-huller so that he can provide a milling service to over 450 families in his community. \n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most families in Nason\u2019s community grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled and thickened to make what is locally called Nshima. The addition of a maize de-huller creates a further refined flour that is in high demand throughout the region. \n\nRent-to-Own has done extensive research in Nason\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest competitor is 2km away, but is often broken down, and since most clients walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. The addition of a maize de-huller is an extra attraction as those wanting the more refined maize flour will be able to have the processing done in the same place as they have their maize milled. This will also draw customers from neighboring communities.\n\nThe high cost of equipment such as a maize mill is  a major barrier, even for successful entrepreneurs like Nason. Once he secures a loan, Nason will be able to get both a maize mill and a de-huller from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his community, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. \n\nWith this maize mill and de-huller, Nason will be positioned to offer the only one-stop shop for maize milling in the area. He hopes to hire an additional employee to help with the day-to-day operation of the equipment. This loan will help Nason build on his successes as an entrepreneur and build up what will surely be a viable business that can provide a much needed service throughout the year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6400,"image":{"id":1474838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

a 31 year-old resident of the city of Istaravshan.  She is married and has two sons.  Istaravshan means a lot to her.  This is where all of the closest to her people are, and this is where she is involved in business.  Nigorakhon and her family are involved in baking flatbread.  Almost 5 years of baking flatbread became a real family business for her.  Her husband mainly helps her.  They bake together and supply flatbread wholesale for sale.  Because Nigorakhon and her husband are honest people and love their work, they uphold a quality standard and their flatbread are the tastiest and delectable.  Nigorakhon wants to expand her small business and build another oven.  Then they will be able to make twice as much flatbread and thus have more income.

She also sells bagged water, ice cream, soft drinks, and other items. She has already invested two loans in her business and is currently requesting her third cycle, which is for 8,000 lempiras. She will invest this in purchasing more products: bagged water, soft drinks, sugar to make pilones (popsicles), and spices to stock her business and sell. Her plan is for her business to stay active and attract more customers in order to obtain higher income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1472179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy spices, soft drinks, bags of water, and sugar to stock her business.

happy man, who is 35 years old.  He is married, but unfortunately does not yet have children.  This is why he pours his whole soul into his work.  Alijon lives with his wife in a small house in a village.  He is involved in his own business to support his family.  Alijon is involved in farming and animal husbandry.  He has land.  Some of the land is rainfed and the rest is irrigated.  Alijon is involved in growing carrots, potatoes and cereal crops on this land.  And his wife helps him to take care and raise livestock.  Because their land is large, they also take their livestock to a pasture there.

She is married and has a few children. She comes from a very friendly family, and they all live in the countryside.   Both Murabat and her son work in order to provide for the family and to bring some money home.  Everyone else helps as much as they can. \r\n\r\nMurubat's husband is retired, and therefore not working.  While Murabat's son works as a carpenter in a local shop and makes an average income, Murubat's main activity is animal husbandry.   She raises and sells livestock, an activity which is quite stable.   Her other children also help her with her work, taking care of the animals and selling the milk that they produce.  Murubat's animal husbandry business brings a good and stable income, which is the reason why she is now thinking of expanding her activity.  \r\n\r\nMurubad needs to buy a few more head of cattle for further breeding and resale.  For this purpose, she has turned to Arvand and would like to receive a loan to purchase some livestock.  She hopes to successfully expand her business in order to make more profits and adequately meet the needs of her family.  She thanks Arvand in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1468653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-11-23T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-22T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Murubat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":464.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":478.18},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":492.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":507.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":522.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":535.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.71},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3101.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673594}],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T20:20:08Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":635634,"name":"Phylis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phylis is a 37-year-old married woman.

He mainly grows tea, which he sells to provide the basic necessities for his children. He started farming in 2003, and has given it enough time to earn enough money from it. He started farming because he thought it was the only way to get money he needed, and growing tea was a cash crop that could grow in the area. He has applied for a loan of one million five hundred thousand shillings to buy fertilizers, so that the soil fertility can be boosted and give better yields. In addition to tea growing, Wilber has a small retail shop in the same area. That gives him additional income, which makes it a bit easier for him to raise funds to pay school dues for his children. However, the bad weather (rain), does not favor his tea and this reduces the quantity produced in a given period.  This decreases the profits, making it hard for him to supply the basic needs for his family members. Wilber strongly believes that by using the loan money to buy fertilizers to put in the tea garden, he will harvest much and will have more profits.

He is 40 years old, married, and the father of four children (three daughters and a son).  His oldest daughter, although only 16, already works as a seamstress, making traditional Tajik outfits.  She is extremely skilled in needlework, and her parents are very proud of her.  Zuhurbek's other children are young and still in school.\r\n\r\nZuhurbek is a biochemist by profession, but he has been involved in agriculture for the past six years.  He grows vegetables on a plot of land next to his house.\r\n\r\nZuhurbek currently has very little money, which makes it difficult to buy the mineral fertilizers and seeds he needs to plant potatoes and carrots for the winter.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan.  He hopes to receive some support, so that he can get a good harvest in the Spring.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1473872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Lleva 6 a\u00f1os en el rubro y desde entonces con el paso de los a\u00f1os ha logrado consolidarlo como un buen negocio gracias a la comercializaci\u00f3n de guano de aves y otros fertilizantes. Le agrada su labor puesto que es un trabajo algo m\u00e1s sencillo que el campo pero con mucha entrega de por medio puesto que debe en ocasiones viajar personalmente  a la capital para  supervisar el traslado de su pedido. Este es su segundo pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva y se siente agradecida por el apoyo financiero que recibe para seguir adelante, adem\u00e1s se compromete a pagar sus cuotas de manera puntual. Desea en esta oportunidad contar con 500.00 nuevos soles para contratar una movilidad y realizar el reparto de abono org\u00e1nico a los anexos de su localidad. \n","en":"Antonia is 38 years old, married, and has three children.

She is married and has four children with two of them currently in school. For the past eight years, Gertrude has been working hard to manage her boutique, where she sells clothes and shoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Gertrude has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes, shoes and bags. This will help Gertrude to generate greater profits and pay school fees.

He opened a grocery store in one of the capital's districts and has been managing it for five years now. His small business works due to the warm welcome he gives to his customers, his experience in the field and the customer base that he has built up over the years. The latter is becoming so significant that he can no longer meet customer demand because his capital is too small and he is obliged to buy in his goods on a retail basis. He is requesting this loan so that he can boost his capital and diversify his goods (rice, salt, mineral water, cartons of sugar, candy..) to increase his profit margin. He will reinvest part of his profit in the business to be able to cover its needs, and the remainder will allow him to provide for his daily needs and those of his

He is married and has four children with three of them currently in school. For the past three years, Francis has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells groceries of different kinds. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Francis has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more goods to sell, and will help Francis to generate greater profits and increase his capital.

He opened a grocery store in one of the capital's districts, which he has been managing for five years now. His small business works well thanks to the warm welcome he gives to his customers, his experience in this field and the customer base which he has built up over the years.

She is married and she and her husband are raising two children. She has secondary-level education, having graduated technical college where she majored in sewing. She worked as a seamstress for 2 years, then she got married and since then has spent 23 years rearing animals and developing crops. She started this business with 5,000 Kyrgyz soms. She has been able to develop her livestock and farming activities. On her farm she has two calves and six sheep and also has a 1.8 hectare patch of land, on which she grows beans and clover. \r\n\r\nElmira's husband works transporting goods for their fellow villagers and he receives a small income.

Currently, he works on a parcel of land in the town where he lives. There, he does a variety of work and independently raises cattle. What he produces is sold so he can complement the income from his current job. Jose is thriving, active and dynamic. His persistence and positive attitude motivate him to seek new alternatives to keep advancing.<br \/><br \/>For this reason, Jose is requesting a loan to buy more cattle to raise and milk. This will allow him to increase production and offer more products for sale. He will be able to complement his income with the income he makes for household expenses.

She is happy and grateful for this opportunity, since this is her only business and in time she wants to have a restaurant so she can provide better comfort, a greater variety of dishes to her customers, and be able to increase her income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1472445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2013-11-23T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-22T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Zoila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":489.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":471.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":498.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":557.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":573.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":591.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":607.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":646.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":696.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":699.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":140.79,"local_amount":961.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":972.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439725263},{"amount":73.35,"local_amount":500.94,"processed_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":506.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449631541},{"amount":73.03,"local_amount":498.69,"processed_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-23T08:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":504.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459098227},{"amount":81.66,"local_amount":557.7,"processed_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-26T08:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":564.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467913240},{"amount":83.97,"local_amount":573.48,"processed_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-20T08:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":580.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479134079},{"amount":86.62,"local_amount":591.51,"processed_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":598.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490827944},{"amount":88.91,"local_amount":607.24,"processed_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":614.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504253764},{"amount":94.64,"local_amount":646.29,"processed_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":653.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517537294},{"amount":302.03,"local_amount":2062.65,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2086.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531211058}],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T15:23:34Z","paid_date":"2014-09-22T09:12:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

However, she works hard so her children can become professionals, which she hopes will come true soon.<br \/><br \/>Thanks to her efforts and her desire to move forward, she works by selling cosmetics from her home and by traveling to new and repeat customers. She works ten hours a day selling her products, which is work she enjoys doing. She will use this loan to invest in working capital and stock up her cosmetics business with items such as eye shadow, eyeliner, lipstick, blush, hydrating cream, perfume, anti-wrinkle cream, masking cream, make-up remover, and cleansing cream. In the near future, she hopes to have better income. Jorgina is grateful to Kiva lenders who provide a dignified source of work to people with a lack of resources in poor countries like

However, he doesn't have sufficient savings to purchase the livestock itself, and so Shavkat has applied for a loan. \r\n\r\nShavkat plans to buy five cows and calves each month from the cattle market in Shahrituz, fatten them and resell them in the same market, but at a higher price.

He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan will greatly assist Artur and he hopes for lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1475223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to pay for renovation of the car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-11-23T16:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-22T16:30:21Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":17697.3},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":21222.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":21547.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22674.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22223.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":22319},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":23369.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":23482.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":23410.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24176.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24534.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":24722.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25262.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25187.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":26146.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26644.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26679.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":27087.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27585.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27993.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":28350.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":28784.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":29195.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":29700.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.3,"local_amount":38927.9,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":39446.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449735666},{"amount":54.06,"local_amount":21622.6,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T09:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":21910.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459214917},{"amount":1348.64,"local_amount":539449.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":546636.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468039914}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T15:04:49Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T16:22:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":634469,"name":"Hilario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hilario se dedica a la reparacion y pintado de carrocer\u00edas;

She is a single lady who is separated with her husband. She takes care of her two children who are now going to school. She comes from a rural area in the Nyarushanje-Rukungiri district. She has been in teaching for many years, but found that the income from teaching was not enough to sustain herself and her family. The reason she went into agriculture was to get additional income.\r\n\r\nHer challenge has been a lack of capital to buy farm inputs to increase her output and earn more income.

Fatmata says that the main challenge to her business is the cost of transportation and insufficient finances to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy more gallons of palm oil for resale.

She is married and her husband works as a day laborer in vegetables. Their two children live with her; the first is 16 years old and is in the first year of high school, while the second, who is 7 years old, is currently in the first grade.\r\n\r\nThe Se\u00f1ora sells atoles [corn based beverage], poleadas [hot drink made of flour and milk] and at times fruit. She has had this business for 7 years. She says that when she was small her parents planted vegetables and she went out to sell the crops and that was how she shed her embarrassment at traveling around selling in the streets. Then her mother used to sell \u201catoles\u201d in the morning at her home. Later when Nuria and her husband separated she continued with her sales, which until today provide the income for her family\u2019s survival. Before selling drinks, she used to sell \u201cpupusas.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe area where she sells is about 3 km. from her house and she takes the bus in order to get there. Her work schedule is generally from 6:30 a.m. to 9 a.m.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase 150 blocks, 5 meters of sand with $150 budgeted to pay for wood. She will build her own house since they will not be living in the family home and consequently her children will have more freedom, more recreation space and will live in a more suitable environment. \r\n\r\nNuria hopes to immediately formally construct her dwelling and then install the right floor to prevent her family from getting diseases.

She is this way in order to give her family better living conditions, that is to say, food, clothing, housing, and good health.  She went to school until the fifth grade.  She is married, and her husband works as a bricklayer.  Her three children live in the house with them, and they go to school.\r\n\r\nThree days a week she makes bread to sell.  Besides that, she gets remittances that a cousin sends her.  She has been a baker for four years.  She says that she learned to make bread because her mother did.  When she was younger and did not have anything else to do, she helped her mother.  After she got used to it, she decided to do it by herself.  She went out to sell it because it did not get all sold out at home.  For the moment, this is her only business.  Before she was a baker, she solely devoted herself to the household chores.  Her husband helps her buy the raw material so that she is able to make the bread.  Her work schedule varies.  Sometimes she makes the bread in the morning and goes to sell it in the afternoon.  Other times she makes it in the afternoons and goes out to sell it in the mornings.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to build a retaining wall in back of her house.  She wants to do this because during the raining season the dirt breaks loose and that makes it difficult for the water to drain.  In order to do this she will buy ten bags of cement, two \u2018quintales' [a quintal is 100 pounds] of iron, and a truckload of sand.  Purchasing all the materials she needs for the construction will help so that the wall will not be damaged by the dirt that gets broken up.\r\n\r\nShe intends to improve her business.  She will do this by purchasing more raw materials and producing more.  She will also expand her house so that her children will live better.  With effort and dedication she will help her children get an education and become professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1473428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy ten bags of cement, two \u2018quintales\u2019 [a quintal is 100 pounds] of iron, and a truckload of sand.

She is 40 years old. She is married. Obod would like to start a business of animal sales. Earlier she only held a couple of cows at her home, in order to provide her family with milk. \r\n\r\nObod knows a lot about the business of livestock breeding and currently decided to devote her skills to the future business. She plans to purchase small bulls and calves. After fattening them for some time, she will sell them at the local market. \r\n\r\nCurrently Obod works in the field with field crop cultivation, but this type of business is seasonal. Therefore, she decided to take a loan and purchase some heads of cattle and start her own business. She hopes that you will support her.

Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile the earth goes around, people get into troubles. That's when they need to consult a lawyer; I want to help those people. I want to be needed by them. The main reason I enrolled in the International and Business Law department is that I want to be a winner. Doing my job good so nobody could hurt my clients is my aim. \r\n\r\nI believe that the process of protecting the rights of clients does not end by the result of the court. I hope that my consulting as a lawyer will not allow my clients let somebody impinge on their indisputable rights for freedom, opinion, and the freedom of speech. For achieving my aim I will become a professional, and I truly believe that AUCA has professors that will help me to become the person I want to. \r\n\r\nVictory is a result of a long process with complications and solutions. I will work hard to achieve my goals. See the goal and go get it. It could be seen as idealistic, but it is not. The small win will make me more confident the next time. That will help me when I will get the biggest and important case in my life. I will look behind and see those victories and loses, which I hope will not stop me, and confidence will fill me. \r\n\r\nCertainty is halfway to success for every professional. Being a student of the IBL department is the first step in achieving my aims. It would be an excellent start for my future life.\r\n\r\nAUCA gives lots of opportunities to its students, one of which is a loan. I would like to take an opportunity and also apply for a Kiva loan. The loan will help me to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1475665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Because of this, he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Irshad has requested for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

Her husband is a barber by profession but his monthly income is not enough to fulfill the household expenses of his family. Therefore, for the past four years, he has also driven taxi at night. Currently he is not able to generate any income from the taxi as its engine is not working properly and needs to be repaired. Naseem has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan to meet the amount of repairing the engine of her husband's taxi. With the profit, her husband wants to open a new auto mechanic shop in future. Naseem desires to provide quality education to all of her children and she prays for the good health of her family and for the growth of her husband's business.

","en":"Hurinisso was born and raised in the countryside.  She is 43 years old, married, and the mother of three adult children.  Her family derives its main source of income from agriculture, essentially growing grains and vegetables such as potatoes, onions and carrots. \r\n\r\nHurinisso owns her farming business, and she runs it with her oldest son.

She and her husband are raising two children.   Her husband, Amantur, works as an executive secretary for the village council.  Gulnur herself is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business 21 years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Gulnur's hard labor, her farming business now comprises seven dairy cows, one horse and 35 sheep.  She keeps her livestock at home, where she has everything she needs to keep farm animals, and in the summer she sends them to graze in the pastures.  She makes a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her activity, Gulnur has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy more sheep and increase her livestock headcount.  She plans to re-invest the profits from her loan into her business, in order to further increase her number of farm animals.  She is also planning to save enough money to continue to pay for her children's education.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1474712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Bumaira has a high school education and she is a very responsible woman.  As the main source of income for her family, she raises livestock, a business that she started 22 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work and perserverance, Bumaira now has three dairy cows and one horse on her farm.  The monthly income on her farm is 4,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, and also with the goal of giving her children a better future, Bumaira has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep to increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use the income from this loan to further increase the size of her herd and she also plans to save up money to buy a

One of his buffaloes has grown old and is producing very little milk. He delivers milk in the market and door-to-door. For delivery purposes, he uses his bicycle. He loads milk cans on his bicycle and delivers it early in the morning. His customers like the fresh and delicious milk he delivers. His monthly net income is too low due to the old buffalo not meeting the household needs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, M. Aslam planned to purchase one more buffalo to increase his sales. However, he finds it difficult due to financial constraints. M. Aslam has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. This will not only help him to increase sales, but it will also increase his net income and savings as well. He hopes to provide a quality education for his children.

Gulira has a secondary education. Immediately after graduation, she married Kazybek and from that moment (that is, since 1998) Gulira and her husband's primary source of income has been cattle breeding and agriculture. They started with 1,500 KGS worth of cows. Today Gulira has extensive experience in this work. Through Gulira's hard work, her farm now boasts three dairy cows, forty sheep, and a 0.80 hectare share of land where she grew beans last season. Her monthly income is 6,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Gulira approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy cows in order to generate additional income from milk sales. Gulira plans to invest profits she makes from the loan into further expanding her herds, and plans to save enough money to repair the house where she lives with her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1474779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Buura village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T01:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T01:30:08Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":57.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5093.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178339},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5093.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462947},{"amount":103.88,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5093.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":529946970},{"amount":102.22,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5093.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.95,"payment_id":542440314},{"amount":194.54,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10187.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.79,"payment_id":561578118},{"amount":583.64,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":30561.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":41.36,"payment_id":579488683}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T03:09:05Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":636116,"name":"Al-Jaki Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Al-Jaki which consists of four ladies who live in Sana`a, Yemen. They are hard-working and responsible women. They took a loan of 140,000 YER.\r\nSalama is 38 years old, married and has three children who live together in a poor area of Sana`a, Yemen. Her husband works hard as a soldier but earns a low salary which is not enough to cover household expenses.
