Business Administration. Here is her story.\r\n\u201cThere are lots of different paths in life. Each person chooses his own through which he will go till the end of his life. Certainly, there are such periods when human beings come to the end of the path and make life-changing decisions. By deciding we choose our path and further life. I would like to get good quality knowledge in order to make come true all my subsequent life plans. That is why when choosing the path I already know which one to choose, this turn, part of my life is AUCA. During studying at high school, I have changed three schools due to family reasons. Level of education varied in each one of them. Until fifth grade I studied at \"Bokonbaeva\" school which is located in Osh. The knowledge which I received there was enough for me to pass admission exams to the Kyrgyz-Turkish high school. Three years of my studies at the lyceum clearly demonstrated that I learned twice as much as at the old one. Seeing the difference I clearly understood that my professional goals can be achieved only if I have good quality education. My parents always said and taught that knowledge that I receive is a key to success, and that number of keys will depend on what type of doors for the future I wish to open for myself and maybe even for the country. To study at AUCA was my dream and I am happy to become part of it now. In order to be able to study at AUCA I have to be competitive and need to improve the level of my English. I started going to the English language courses at \"Education for All\" (SOROS). Also, I started taking TOEFL preparation course and studied math on a regular basis with my sister who worked as a teacher at my first school. I think that these efforts did not go in vain, at the end of this school year I will finish my English course in advanced group at \"Education for All\" and have no doubts of receiving a good score on the exams which will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also hope to hold a key to AUCA doors which later will open more doors for other opportunities. Studies at AUCA will definitely give me enough knowledge in order to achieve my goals and bring plans to reality. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to its students one of which is Kiva loan and it gives students a good chance to study here. All the students that need a financial aid are eligible to apply for it and mostly they are awarded a loan. I am also applying for a loan, so that I am able to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1475840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Torng is 34 years old and blessed with one little son who is too young for school. She overcomes her family\u2019s hardship via rice farming and a pig-raising business. To earn extra income for her entire household, she also works for others for a fee. The business that she has had for several years earns her about 22,200 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nTorng is a second-time borrower, whereas her joint borrower is a first-cycle client with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

There are lots of advantages why one has chosen to study at this university. The main thing that appeals to me is the study of laws; International business and law to contribute to the development of business and law in Kyrgyzstan in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you study in this field, you can find many different jobs where you can work. During my life, I have always been interested in studying different laws and legislation. I really love watching different court cases on TV. I often defend my friends in different situations and I think I do it very well. Even if I want to create my own business, legal education will help me do so.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have chosen this program because I think that a lawyer is an interesting professional. There are many different legal situations in our lives, and a lawyer can contribute to their solution and help other people.\r\n\r\nAnd the final thing that attracts me is that students and professors have very friendly and close relationships, which makes the studying process itself easier and more pleasant. AUCA gives another unique opportunity to its students, which is loan. The loan is given to all students applying for financial aid, which is given by Kiva. I am very happy that AUCA cooperates with such a great organization that gives us - students - such an opportunity.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1470564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She is motivated to earn the income to go with the money from her husband's carpentry shop. She is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to invest in cosmetic products and clothing to sell, since she wants to stock her business more for the end of the year. And she plans to use another portion to purchase tools for her husbands workshop. In this way they will earn more income and be able to improve the family's quality of life through better nutrition and education. Their goals for the family in the future is to support their children's eduction so they become professionals, as well as to have a well-equiped carpentry workshop.

Ulubek's mother is retired and also lives with Rakhat and her family, helping look after their children when she can.\r\n     \r\nRakhat's farm is ideal for raising livestock.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, she currently has a dairy cow and 10 sheep on her farm, and her monthly income has grown to nearly 4,000 som.  To further develop her farm, she is seeking a loan of 100,000 som from Bai Tushum & Partners to buy some cows.  She hopes to use any future earnings due to the loan to continue to buy more livestock, as well as to save up money for a sewing machine, as she loves to sew and embroider in her spare

He started the business mainly because it was in line with what he started and he was convinced it would be a rewarding business. His clients are mainly government parastatals (government businesses), schools and SACCOS (savings and credit cooperatives).\r\n\r\nHe hopes to use the loan money of two million Uganda Shillings to buy a plot of land so that he can construct a house there in future. His challenges among others are the high cost of rent, high electric tariffs and the bad debtors who never pay back and these take a big portion of his profits. He is a shrewd business man who hopes to overcome the challenges highlighted especially if the loan is

Ana is married and a mother to three children.  The two oldest are in primary school while the youngest still stays at home.  With her husband, Ana works in farming, sowing and growing coffee.  Ana learned this trade from her husband some time ago.  Ana manages the business while her husband is responsible for maintaining and looking after the land and the crops.  This will be the couple's second harvest.  Ana and her husband own the land they work, thanks to the efforts that they both put in so that they could avoid working for other people.  They value and appreciate their land as, in the future, when they are gone, they can leave it to their children.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, the couple wants to buy a vehicle so as to be able to travel to the land.  The vehicle would help the couple to transport supplies to the land and deliver their crops to buyers at the end of the harvest.  Currently they transport these goods on a motorcycle.\r\n\r\nEvery mother's dream is, first, for her children to be in good health.

At AUCA, I will have to practise on a daily basis because I will be surrounded by English-speaking people. I will be able to advance to the highest level and then I will be able to travel around the world without any problems with language skills. \r\n\r\n\"Finally, the most important reason is that I will become a high-quality specialist. The American University of Central Asia gives its students high-quality knowledge. Graduates of the AUCA are demanded everywhere in our country as good specialists. Many employers of different companies in Kyrgyzstan value graduates of this university.\r\n\r\n\"Among all the above-mentioned opportunities, AUCA gives Kiva loans to students. I would like to take the opportunity to apply for a loan that could help me to partially cover my tuition fees. It is a great chance for those students whose families are not able to cover their tuition fees fully.\u201d

His major challenge is the lack of enough capital, but he hopes to overcome this if the Kiva funds through UGAFODE are given, because he will buy enough stock and will then have a competitive edge.\r\n\r\nWith his hard work, Felix is determined to achieve his goal of having and operating a wholesale shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1475923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy household items to sell in his retail shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T14:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T14:10:07Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":333333.34,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":337330.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449752784},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":168665.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233758},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166666.99,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":168665.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468059207},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":166666,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":168664.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479277051},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166667.02,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":168665.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490973644},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":166666.98,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":168665.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504414724},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":833333,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":843326.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692328}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T15:21:21Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T17:49:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":636249,"name":"Constance","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Constance is a married mother of five children, all of whom go to school.

Everyone has been to middle school. Marguerite opened a store and has been running it for two years selling take-out beverages. Her business is doing well, but she often lacks inventory to sell, since her capital does not allow otherwise.

She became involved in business about 20 years ago because her family was facing financial difficulties due to lack of resources.  She decided to begin selling merchandise on credit, on foot, and little by little she began gaining more customers.  Her main challenge was to locate customers when it came time to collect, so she decided to open a store 13 years ago, where she offers products such as men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, toys, accessories, personal products, and other things.  She can serve customers more comfortably and also has the advantage of being able to exhibit her products.  This has allowed her to generate sufficient income to pay for basic household needs.  Her drive, charisma and dedication have allowed her to surpass various obstacles, and this has brought her to where she is today.\r\n\r\nNow, at her 49 years, she is asking for her first loan so she can buy merchandise in quantity (toys, Christmas decorations, accessories, and other things).  This way she will have a stock to satisfy her customers\u2019 different needs and likes, and help increase her sales and the benefits she gets from them.  This way Blanca can have the opportunity to grow her business and expand into other sectors, which will mean achieving her main dream.

De esta manera Nancy desea continuar realizando su labor y tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de seguir avanzando hacia el cumplimiento de su principal sue\u00f1o que es poder construir otros dos apartamentos para alquilar y as\u00ed complementar los ingresos con los que podr\u00e1 dar una educaci\u00f3n de excelente calidad a su hijo y disfrutar junto a \u00e9l una mejor calidad de vida y bienestar. ","en":"Nancy is 35years old and the single mother of a five year old son, for whom she has worked tirelessly since his birth.  She worked as a domestic employee at many homes for many years, but she got tired of the extensive labor and the lack of possibility of improving her income, so she decided to retire and used her severance pay to open her own business, selling coffees, aromatics, and wooden games on foot, around and within the market plaza in her town.  She has been doing this for 10 years and it allowed her to buy a home of her own and support her son.\r\n\r\nHer spirit of success, strong, positive mental fortitude and well-defined goals have motivated her to request this loan so she can buy new thermoses to store her products, disposable items in quantity (cups, stirrers, napkins), pay off another loan she has from a speculator, and have capital available to restock every two weeks (coffee, aromatics, fruit, sugar, and other things).  This will allow her to improve her business profitability, because speculators charge high interest rates and not having to return to them will allow her the income she needs to continue supporting her household needs and invest more into her business.  She can give it better continuity and continue to offer good quality products to her customers.\r\n\r\nNancy wants to continue working and having the opportunity to advance toward completing her main dream of building some apartments to rent out so she can provide an excellent quality education to her son and enjoy the best quality of life and wellbeing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1472496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T17:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T17:30:05Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":113423},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":116552},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":119767},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":123071},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":126466},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":129955},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133540},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137226}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.55,"local_amount":113411,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":114156.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074831},{"amount":61.19,"local_amount":116537,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":117303.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010043},{"amount":127.49,"local_amount":242865,"processed_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":244462.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523673},{"amount":66.31,"local_amount":126297,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":127127.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227367},{"amount":68.23,"local_amount":129956,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":130810.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245008},{"amount":70.19,"local_amount":133571,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":134449.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855763},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":137363,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":138266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282520}],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T16:57:53Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T14:03:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She has a primary level of education and completed up to fifth grade, since she married at a very young age, when she was 16, and later had children. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her husband died five years ago, because he was suffering from an ulcer which could not be controlled. Since then, she has had to take care of the coffee crop and continue struggling to take care of the well-being of her children. \r\n\r\nThe oldest is 31 years old, already married, and has his own crops. He only studied to fifth grade because he was the only man in the family, and when his father developed health problems, it was up to him to take care of the farm, so he neglected his studies.\r\n\r\nThe second is 25 years old and only studied until sixth grade because she didn't like school. Over time, she got married. She lives with her husband in her mother's house, since her husband works outside of the community.\r\n\r\nThe last daughter is 21 years old and is a professional. She graduated as a primary school teacher, and practices her profession in an institution attended by people in poverty. During harvest time, she is involved in cutting the beans.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela's coffee crop is located 200 meters from the home she lives in. The only problem she has is that the broker will not buy the beans at a fair price, since competition is not a problem.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela's goal is to continue growing more coffee plants to earn a better income, and to buy more land to leave to her children as an inheritance so they can get ahead. Her only wish is that her youngest daughter can continue her university studies.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, today she has asked for financing from the COMIXMUL cooperative to buy agricultural inputs to care for her coffee crop and get an excellent crop this season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1473605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs to care for her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T17:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T17:30:06Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":15389.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459082684}],"funded_date":"2013-11-24T22:19:46Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T10:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Alexander","image":1669027}},{"id":634041,"name":"Zoraida Yisel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zoraida, a sus 32 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera de dos hijos.

Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit

For the past four years, Lillian has been working hard to manage her produce business, which sells maize flour, beans and rice. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Lillian has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more produce, and will help Lillian to generate greater profits and take care of her parents. Lillian hopes that in the future, she will be able to construct rental houses. \r\n\r\nLillian is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

One of their grandchildren lives with Martin and his wife.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school, Martin started working in farming with his father.  Later on, he spent 15 years working as a road worker, helping to fix the roads.  Later still Martin spent two years as a builder, working with a relative who taught Martin the basics of this work.  With this experience, Martin decided to start taking on small jobs independently.  As the years passed, he gained more experience and more customers.  This was now 30 years ago and, as time has gone by, with a lot of effort Martin has been able to buy a small plot of land.  During the days he worked on other people's houses and at night he built his own.  With a lot of hard work, Martin will finish building his house.  People now come looking for Martin to do work in nearby places.  He works all day long.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy tools for building work.

Her youngest son is a foreign worker in Russia, and is helping financially. Karamat has a secondary education. \r\n\r\nThe primary source of income for her family is a livestock business, which she started 18 years ago with the purchase of a cow for 5,000 KGS. Through hard work, Karamat's farm now has three milk cows and four sheep. Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS. In order to grow her business, Karamat applied for a 100,000 KGS loan from microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners in order to purchase cows to raise and then resell on the market at a higher price. Karamat plans to invest the income from the loan to increase the number of domestic animals she owns, and hopes to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1474964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows to feed and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bel village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.05,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karamat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":922.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1127.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":911.53,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":45110.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.97,"payment_id":467831026},{"amount":1124.42,"local_amount":55000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":55134.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.08,"payment_id":529946972}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T17:42:15Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Max Prilutsky","image":1270958}},{"id":634635,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":634658,"name":"Santiago","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santiago de 50 a\u00f1os de edad, solo estudio hasta 6\u00b0 grado,  debido a que su  pap\u00e1 muri\u00f3 y quedo solo con su mam\u00e1 y para ayudar en los gastos del hogar tuvo que dejar la escuela.

This is due to the fact that his father died and he was left alone with his mother. To help with the household expenses he had to leave school. He is married, and he and his wife sell fruit drinks and sandwiches.  They have five children, but four of them are already married and have their own families; only one lives with them and is going to school. In the house it is only him, his son, his wife and his mother.  \r\n\r\nSantiago and his wife have been selling fruit drinks and sandwiches for two years. Before selling fruit drinks he worked buying scrap but he earned very little, and later began to sell fruit drinks.  He started with 25 fruit drinks and sandwiches, but increased it little by little each day. Today he has to make 200 fruit drinks and 200 sandwiches, and to transport them to where he sells them he bought an old pickup.\r\n\r\nThen he sells them from house to house on foot. They get up at 5:00 a.m. to begin preparing the chicken for the sandwiches, then at 11:00 a.m. they are brought to where he sells them, and they return at 4:00 p.m. This is how their life is, but he dreams of having a permanent store.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to repair the vehicle he uses for bringing his merchandise to the place where he sells it, and he will invest the remainder in his sandwiches and fruit drinks business. \r\n\r\nHis dream for the future is to buy a piece of land and build his own home, as today the place he lives belongs to his mother. In addition, he dreams of seeing his son graduate from university. From the profits he expects to begin paying off his loan so that he can keep his business going, and in the future have a permanent store and not have to sell door-to-door but be in one

She only completed elementary school, before she decided that she didn't enjoy studying and turned her attention to household chores. When she grew up, Do\u00f1a Zulma married and had four sons. Her oldest son is 25 and left school after the third grade because he also didn't enjoy studying. He married when he grew up, worked hard, and bought his own coffee plantation, where he works with his son. He and his family live in the same community as Do\u00f1a Zulma, but in a different section. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Zulma's other three children live with her and help with her coffee crops. The second son is 15, has finished his middle school studies, and plans, with his trust in God, to continue his studies and prepare to enter a university. The third son is 12, has finished elementary school, and plans to continue studying next year. Do\u00f1a Zulma's fourth son is 11 and is in the fifth grade. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Zulma has worked the land since she was a girl, when her parents taught her to farm. With the subsequent support of her husband, Do\u00f1a Zulma has learned more about farming and has used this experience to the greatest advantage.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Zulma hopes to purchase more land to increase her coffee production and boost her income. This would allow her to leave part of her land to her sons and ensure their future so that they can continue to study and have successful, professional careers. Do\u00f1a Zulma did not go to school for very long and wants her children to get the education that will change their lives.\r\n \r\nShe is therefore now applying for a loan to pay for the purchase of farming supplies to help her coffee crops.

She is married to Roel, a pedicab driver, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRemelyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one packet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells burgers for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

38 years old and married.  She and her husband are raising four children.  She is a very calm, honest and goal-oriented woman.  She has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business 16 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, she now owns four dairy cows, two horses and 25 sheep.  Her husband and children help her to run the business.  Beside helping his wife, her husband also works as a private building contractor and brings a small income home.  The family makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her farming business, Jyldyzgul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy some cows to increase her cattle headcount.  She plans to re-invest the profits from this loan back into her business by purchasing additional livestock. She is also planning to save enough money to repair her house. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1475050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jalgyz-Terek village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":67.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jyldyzgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:50:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50122.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749616},{"amount":957.2,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50122.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":67.8,"payment_id":579488686}],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T00:32:00Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":636639,"name":"Carmelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelita is 60 years old and married with eight children.\r\n\r\nCarmelita works hard to provide for her family.

This is an area where a lot of cotton is produced and her family worked in that. Over the years she grew up and married and started her own family.

Being a mother and a father at the same time is difficult, but with God's help, nothing is impossible. Her oldest son helps her a lot, as they have some plots of land where they grow corn and beans that they use for household consumption.

He has a life partner, who takes care of their two children. Juan has a chicken farm. He began farming at age 10 with his father. He also drives tractors and cars, which required learning the trade from a friend. He has been a driver for 10 years and thanks that friend because he supports his family with this work.\r\n\r\nFarming means getting up at 4:30 AM and leaving at 5:00 AM to arrive at his boss's house. He walks for half an hour, works 10 hours on the tractor, and comes home in the afternoon to tend his field. He will use this loan to buy two cows to plow the field, leaving the mulch that he wants to take advantage of.  \r\n\r\nHe dreams of leaving his children a house and seeing them graduate from college, which he was not able to do. He doesn't want that to happen to them, so he is trying to save. The best way to do this is to buy some cows and start earning money from their milk and from his crops.

Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Gulumkan came to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 20,000 som (KGS) loan to buy a heifer to expand her herd. She plans to invest the earnings from use of the loan into further increasing her livestock holdings, and also plans to save money to do repairs to her home.

In spite of her young age, she already has five children and she brings them up happily with her husband.   She has a higher education and works as a chief adviser for her village council.  In addition to her job, she is also involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides an extra income for her family, as it would be difficult to live on her salary alone, especially with five children to support.  Maksatkan's husband works as a private driver, providing transportation services to people, from village to village.\r\n\r\nMaksatkan has been involved in animal husbandry for 15 years.  She started in this business by buying livestock for 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, she now owns four dairy cows and five horses.  She makes a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her farming business, Maksatkan has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS). She will use her loan to buy some sheep in order to increase her livestock headcount. She plans to re-invest the profits from this loan back into her business by purchasing additional livestock. She is also planning to save enough money to buy a washing machine, because her children are still young and she needs to wash clothes every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1475072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
