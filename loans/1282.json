I am very happy that my parents support my intention to study at AUCA because it is very important.  I am sure that AUCA will give a high-level degree to become successful and realize all my plans for the future.  AUCA gives lots of opportunities to its students, one of which is a loan.

University and faculty there are many questions, but I knew from the very beginning what my goal was and gradually came to it. Starting from my childhood, I watched TV programs and repeated them, even though did not know that it was a profession of journalist. Year after year, I started to explore the world of journalism and I began to like it more and more. It is very difficult to explain what it means to me to be a journalist, but the most important thing is to be informed and share information with people all over the world. Because there are lots of interesting things happening in daily life journalists convey them to the people through TV, internet, radio, newspaper and magazines. Hence, journalists make our life more colorful and more interesting.\r\nAUCA is one of the best universities of Central Asia, not only our country. In addition the teaching methods are very modern and the university atmosphere is very cheerful and friendly, that\u2019s not all at the end of studying at AUCA students will fluently speak not only English, but also several languages which helps AUCA graduates to find best jobs.\r\nMy choice was influenced by New Generation Academy of AUCA. With the help of this program, I changed my views about AUCA. I am very grateful for a chance to become part of NGA, which gradually changed my life. \r\nAUCA gives another opportunity, it gives a loan through KIVA, which is great opportunity for all the students to cover their tuition fees. So, taking an opportunity I am also applying for KIVA loan, which will help me to cover my tuitions.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1476602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

motivate me to apply at AUCA. These reasons have generated a spiritual or emotional feeling in my self to choose AUCA for future education in order to fulfill my career objectives successfully.  AUCA's acknowledgment and credibility in the education world would provide me a competitive edge over the other students.  This university has tried with so many well-known and emerging organizations and government agencies so it would help me excel in my professional career.\r\n\r\nThe last year at high school I started thinking about my future profession.  Sure enough, it was easy for me to choose my profession.  There are a lot of universities in my country and they are different from each other.  I decided to study at AUCA. Successfully I decided to first start from the New Generation Academy within AUCA, which helped me fill my educational gaps and it greatly prepared me to find myself and my future profession.  I decided to study Journalism in the Mass Communications Department.  Of course it was not easy to find my future profession but now I freely can say that I fell in love with this department.  I have been introduced to lots of students from the JMC Department, they really gave me piece of advice how to study well and how to write clear articles.  When I studied at school I was minister of media, and every day I had to write articles and take photos. \r\n\r\nI am a sociable person.  I have participated in different and useful programs such as \u201cAccess Micro scholarship program\u201d. I am also an alumni of the program, \u201cTechnology age Girls\u201d \u2013 where I am finalist of this project, \u201cNew Generation Academy\u201d.  I am well organized, responsible and patient, with goals to achieve. \r\n\r\nAnother great opportunity that AUCA gives to it's students is that it gives a loan to cover tuition fees.  This loan is given through Kiva and all students entering AUCA are able to apply for it.  I also have financial restrictions in my family and am applying for it.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1476610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

I am the oldest sister and feel responsible for my sisters. Therefore, I enrolled the American University of Central Asia, which will give me an excellent higher education to be independent enough to support them in the future.\r\n \r\nBut my family is not able to cover the tuition fees without an additional source. So, I don\u2019t really want money to be a deterrent factor, stopping me from studies. Therefore, I would be much grateful to get a Kiva loan to cover part of my expenses, which will allow me to study and not think about finances while pursuing my degree.

She is 36 years old and happily married with two children. She lives in Tuyabang Bajo, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental.

His parents have limited resources and can't give him the opportunity to continue going to school.  He's single and has no children.  He lives with his parents and two siblings.\r\n\r\nElmer learned to repair bicycles and motorcycles because a neighbor and friend is a professional in that field, and every afternoon Elmer went to his place after school.  To learn the job, he practiced everything he learned on his own bicycle.  This was how he set up his own bicycle and motorcycle repair shop about six months ago.  He also is able to work as a day laborer on the sugar plantations near his home.\r\n\r\nElmer's going to use the loan to invest in his shop.  He needs additional stock so he can give more comprehensive and professional service.  He plans to buy tires, rims, single rims, gears, cassettes, patches, and so forth.\r\n\r\nElmer dreams of becoming a professional automobile mechanic, so he wants to work a lot to continue with his studies in college and prepare himself academically to help his parents, improve himself, and have a better quality of life.  He's going to save his profits from his business to use later for his education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1474301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

So, I want to get my bachelor degree at AUCA, in the department of International and Business Law. I worked hard during 11 years of studies at my high school. I was both active in classes and always participated in different activities such as drawing, photography competitions, debates, dance, writing competitions, etc. Also this year I made a project about cleaning oil spills from soil. My project passed to Georgia and the Netherlands. The experiment was really interesting for me. I would also like to mention that I'm a diligent student, not only in studies. My hobby is writing poems of different genres. I chose the American University of Central Asia because is it one of the best universities in Central Asia. Professors at AUCA are from different countries of the world. The life in the university is really interesting. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to all the students; one of which is a Kiva loan. The loan helps students to cover their tuition fees, which is a great help to those students who cannot afford to pay the fees fully.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1476568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nGloria operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nGloria dreams to expand her business and hopes to give her family a good life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1476703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her husband works in a school. Ubadat has a secondary education. She is a homemaker. As the main source of income for her family, Ubadat practices livestock breeding. She started this business 20 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ubadat's hard work, she currently has 8 sheep on her farm. Ubadat primarily practices sheep breeding by herself, making hay and putting her sheep out to graze. Her son helps her in this business. Once a year, Ubadat sheers the sheep and takes care of the veterinary work. Three times a day, she feeds the sheep and gives them water. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Ubadat turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 515,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep to increase the size of her herd. Ubadat plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to improve the financial security of her family.

Porque no quiere regresar a trabajar en autobuses ya que resulta muy peligroso ahora, por los niveles de delincuencia que azotan a este rubro y \u00e9l planea entrar a este rubro dice que lo conoce y le parece una buena oportunidad para sacar adelante a su familia. \n    \nLa idea es tener un trabajo seguro, estable y rentable luego de la temporada azucarera; porque mientras se trabaja ah\u00ed, no hay problema se gana bien y se trabaja horas extras y se las pagan al doble y al terminar la safra dedicarse a la compra\/venta de frutas y verduras y as\u00ed mejorar las condiciones de vida de \u00e9l y su familia,  mejorar la casa y que los hijos estudien y vivir de forma mas solvente sin limitaciones.","en":"Jos\u00e9, 34, only has a basic education.  He is married and his wife is a homemaker and cares for the children.  Jos\u00e9 currently works as a truck and urban bus driver.  He also grows corn on a half acre of land for family consumption and takes care of two cows.  His children are small and the eldest is the only one who goes to school.  The second will begin elementary next year.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 will be starting the sugar harvest season and will be driving a trailer taking sugar from the factory to the distribution centers.  He has been involved in this work for 16 consecutive years so he has much experience; but this work only lasts around six months in the summer or until the sugar cane harvest in the eastern part of the country is over.  After that, Jos\u00e9 works as an urban public transportation driver in the city.  He was given the opportunity 20 years ago to learn how to drive buses and trucks so now that is the main source of income for the family.  His workplace is 4 kilometers from home so he must get up very early in the morning to go to work.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy a pick up truck to sell fruits and vegetables after the harvest season.  He prefers not to work with buses now because of the high crime rate in this sector now.  He plans to go into the new business because he is familiar with it and it will be a good way to provide for his family.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a safe, stable, profitable job after the sugar cane season; because as long as he is working on the harvest he earns a good income with no problems.  He even earns double pay for overtime.  When the harvest is over he can buy and sell fruits and vegetables to improve his family's living conditions, improve the house, give his children an education and resolve the problem without limitations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1474325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

66-year-old widow. After her husband's death, she raised three children by herself.  Her oldest son and daughter-in-law live with their mother and help with the housework, while the rest are married and live separately. \r\n\r\nMairam has a college education, and is a teacher of Kyrgyz language and literature. She worked at the school for 28 years, is now retired. All of the locals relate very warmly to Karamat, as she raised and trained a generation of students. \r\n\r\nIn parallel, Mairam has earned additional income for her family since 1974 through livestock and field crops from cattle purchased for 1,000 KGS.  Thanks to Mairam's hard work, she now has two milk cows, two horses, one calf and a 2.40 hectare plot of land on which she grows peppers, beans and clover. Her monthly income is 13,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nIn order to further grow her business, Mairam has applied for a 60,000 KGS loan from the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners in order to purchase steers to increase her livestock count.  Mairam plans to invest income from loan to further grow the number of domestic animals and plans to save enough money to repair her

50 years old, married, and is raising three children with her husband. Her eldest daughter is married and her sons help with the housework. Her husband works as a weigher at a local utility. Cholponkan has a secondary education, and has been working in a factory as a weigher for 25 years. \n\nFor additional income, Cholponkan and her family are involved in animal husbandry. They started 29 years ago with the purchase of a cow for 3,000 KGS. Through hard work in her business, Cholponkan now has two dairy cows and one horse. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS.

Her daughters are married and live seperately. Her son is 16 years old, lives with her and helps her with her farming. Marpatkhan has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Marpatkhan practices livestock breeding. She started this business 23 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to the hard work of Marpatkhan and her son, she currently has 6 milk cows and 30 sheep on her farm. Marpatkhan milks the cows and sells the milk, while her son buys the hay and feeds the livestock. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). Marpatkhan is in the farming group \"Kyzyl-Kiya.\" This group already has two members in it; Marpatkhan is the third member. For the purpose of further developing her business, Marpatkhan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy heifers to increase the size of her herd. Marpatkhan plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to renovate the house she currently lives in."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1475703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Of this whole plot, only 3.24 hectares are irrigated, 0.23 hectares are grazing pastures and the remaining parts are under water. Haimurot, along with four other field hands, grow vegetables, cotton and wheat on 3.24 hectares of land. Currently, Haimurot is planning to simultaneously start his own business fattening up and reselling cattle as his communal farm has a big plot for grazing. This means that there will not be a problem with feeding them. He has already been storing up a huge amount of feed for them for winter. Haimurot is requesting a loan to buy cattle. He plans to buy three bulls every month from the Qubadiyon market, fatten them up over the course of 25-30 days, and resell them at a mark-up at the very same market. If he is able to start this business, he will have an additional, stabile income which will allow his family to live

She has been a widow for twelve years. She has three children: the oldest already graduated from high school and no longer lives with her; the son is nearing his eighteenth birthday, and next year he will begin high school; the girl is fourteen years old and has completed seventh grade. Also living with her is a two year old child who is her nephew. She is raising him as her own son since he was left on her patio. Isabel has to watch over all of the previously mentioned family members as well as cover all of the expenses. \r\n\r\nIsabel has been working in trade since her childhood when she first learned from her mother to work arduously at this activity. She mainly sells clothing for women and men (shirts, blouses, pants, skirts, underwear, and so on). She buys her products by the dozen and sells them as a mobile street vendor throughout the entire community. She has to walk long distances in order to manage to show her products to potential customers. She is a hardworking and very responsible woman. On some occasions, her daughter sells with her, but most of the time she works alone from the first hours of the morning until the evening. She also sells lotions and cosmetics through catalogs.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to buy merchandise that will increase her sales (clothing and cosmetics) and so as to have a greater income. This will help her to cover home expenses and provide her children with their basic necessities. This loan will also cover the need for working capital since during the summer sales are at their highest and she can have more income. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to become financially stable so that she could have a better quality of life and succeed in seeing her children excel and attend universities so that they could become good citizens."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1474338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy merchandise that will increase her sales (clothing and cosmetics).

She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1376639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

These women are friendly and kind, and they also maintain the traditions and culture of their people. They live in a community belonging to the district \"El Valle\" in Cuenca, which is known for its beautiful landscapes and varied cuisine.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Patricia. She is 48-years old and separated from her husband but, while they were still together, they had two beautiful children who are now 3 and 4 years old. She does not have her own house, but lives with her mother with whom she shares the home's expenses.

Jamoliddin is already married and is raising two daughters. They are 5 and 3 years old. Jamoliddin himself is 29 years old. All he has left to do is to find a good job to provide for his wife and children, so that they do not not need for anything. Jamoliddin decided to start his own business. He will sell perfume.

In this communal bank, the partners are mostly craftsmen; there are some that sell jewelry, some are electricians and some sell clothing catalogs. \r\n\r\nMarlene is an artisan of chilota wool, and also teaches loom classes. She began working in this business three years ago. Before that, she was employed at a supermarket and worked Monday through Sunday, which was very distressing because she could not share time with her family. That is why she decided to leave her job and enter in the business of woolen crafts, which she learned to make when she was very young. This way she is able to be closer to her family. One of her biggest goals is to bring loom classes to all of Chile. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she requests will help her to buy a more modern loom than the one she has, and also to buy more wool since she has many orders for wool garments. She is very happy and excited because she knows that she will do very well. \r\n\r\nShe enjoys working together with Fondo Esperanza [Hope Fund], because it gives the opportunity to receive money and to be able to share with different people. One of the things that she likes the most is that they always make time to share with the other partners of the bank.\r\n

Thus, she would like to provide schooling to her grandchildren, expand her business plans, and build a nice house for her retirement. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, she thanks Hekima very much for promoting autonomy among unbanked women entrepreneurs, especially during this critical time of war in the country's east.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1478407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase 'pagne' cloth to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

He entered into a relationship when he was very young.  His life partner works selling tortillas that she makes with their older daughters every day.  His daughters no longer go to school.  Only the 12 year old goes to the seventh grade at the community school, which is two kilometers from their house.\r\n\r\nMaricio does agricultural work for himself and as a salaried worker.  At times he also works as an assistant bricklayer.  He generally works almost every day.  He has been working this way ever since he was young.  He used to work with his father.\r\n\r\nBefore, Maricio was the only one that worked.  However, at times it was difficult to cover his household\u2019s living expenses.  When the family grew, there were more expenses.  His life partner started to work in order to help her husband with the household expenses.  Now, his older daughters are involved after having finished the ninth grade in school.  The area where he works is in his own community, and he just uses a bicycle to get there.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is to buy raw material for his wife\u2019s business of selling tortillas.  He will buy corn and firewood.  He will also harvest 7,000 square meters of corn that he has grown one kilometer from his house.  This way, his wife will have inventory in order to work with their daughters.  Meanwhile, Mauricio works as a day worker.  They assure themselves of having financial stability and of keeping the customers to whom they provide tortillas every day.\r\n\r\nIn the future he plans to expand his house by building a new room.  This is because his daughters are older, and the family has grown.  He wants to see if it is possible for his daughters to continue their high school education.  Even though it is in the future, he would like them to be able to be successful professionally.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1474353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw material for his wife\u2019s business of selling tortillas.

Her husband and younger son are working in Russia as builders, and send money back home to  Kyrgyzstan every month.  However, the money is not enough for a family and Bumairam has decided not to sit idly by, and to develop a livestock business. Thankfully, this worked out okay. She started her business 15 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 2,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Bumairam's household has 6 dairy cows, 10 sheep and 5 horses, as well as a plot of land measuring 0.72 hectares, which she uses to grow corn. Her monthly income is 8,000 KGS. Bumairam is a member of the group \"Zhashtyk\", which includes 2 other people. Bumairam is the second member. In order to further grow her business, Bumairam has appealed to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 20,000 KGS for the purchase of sheep for breeding. Bumairam plans to invest the income from the loan into further increasing the amount of livestock, and plans to save enough money to purchase sheepyards to further expand her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1475828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is 31 years old, married, and lives with his wife and two children. Lasha earns a living through bread distribution. He buys bread in the early morning from the local bakery and then distributes them to local food markets. His earnings are modest, and he doesn\u2019t manage to save money. \r\n\r\nLasha will start a bakery with the received loan. His wife is good at baking and wishes to sell the products to the local people. Lasha will purchase construction materials and renovate a small store that is located near his house.

","en":"Fariza is a young and ambitious girl. She is 19 years old. She is not married and lives with her parents and sisters. Fariza was born and raised in a poor family. Her father is a migrant worker in Russia. After high school, she could not attend university, as her parents did not have enough money to pay for her tuition. She was a perfect student in high school. Fariza began a livestock business 3 years ago. She has gradually grown her business and developed her skills in introducing the business.

Thanks to her first loan, she was able to invest in her coffee crop by purchasing necessary supplies such as: fertilizers, foliar feed, urea, and other items to apply. These are necessary and important for maintaining healthy crops with excellent foliage. Reina was also able to use some of the supplies on 3 manzanas of corn that she had cultivated, allowing her to give them some care and maintenance. At the end of the month of October she was able to harvest 24 loads and sell them at a very good price. With this she was able to pay off her first loan and, with her head held high from fulfilling her obligation, request a second loan to cultivate a final crop of corn. The crop will generate further income that she will be able to put towards maintaining her coffee crops. She has faith and hope that with an excellent harvest she will be able to improve living conditions for her and her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1474350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to prepare the land to cultivate a final crop of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T19:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T19:50:06Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":12327,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812957}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T04:13:32Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:28:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Paulson","image":1289394}},{"id":636950,"name":"Mary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is the leader of this group.

The plants that she and her son tend were planted by her husband who died some time ago.

The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan is highly important for Arman to be able to complete the order received from his customer and continue his stone grinding business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":594.12,"image":{"id":1477015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

Her customers are the different intermediaries who come to the area as well as neighbors and friends. Her crops are located 100 meters away from her house which means that she has to walk to attend to her crops. \r\nHer plans and future goals are to be able to fix her house that needs a decent roof, plaster on the walls, and a cement floor so that they can avoid the contamination of viruses of the respiratory system that are passed between family members due to the humidity in the walls. \r\nAs a mother, she will continue to support her children with all of her strength so that they can graduate to the next level and be good people in life.

It is comprised of men and women whose major activity is farming. They are all married with their children in schools. \r\n\r\nThey applied for a loan of UGX 3,900,000 as a group which will be shared between the individuals. They have the challenge of low production within their businesses due to poor farming methods -- banana wilt among others. \r\n\r\nTheir prime target is to change the lives of their families and also to take their children to better schools rather than having them get a poor education.
