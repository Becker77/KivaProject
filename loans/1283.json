In 1996, John started Sustainable Community Development Services (SCODE), a national NGO that started as a community-based organization with an aim to enable the poor in Kenya to improve their lives by adopting environmentally friendly technologies. SCODE exists to facilitate adoption of clean energy technologies and sustainable land use approaches through capacity building, awareness campaigns, and last-mile product distribution. The organization has an office and community-training center in Kenya. Over the last 17 years, SCODE has established a track record of promoting solar energy, improving management of natural resources, and allowing low-income families to improve both their quality of life and carbon footprint. In 2006, SCODE won the prestigious Energy Globe Award for Sustainable Energy in recognition of its work with small-scale farmers across Western Kenya.\n\nOne Degree Solar started working with John in 2011 when introducing its first solar lighting product, during which time One Degree sent a summer intern to work with SCODE and begin developing an SMS tool to help monitor impact. SCODE was a natural partner with years of experience selling solar systems, clean cook stoves, and other life-improving products. SCODE now sells the One Degree BrightBox system, which powers up to four light bulbs, as well as mobile phones and radios. Currently, families spend significant portions of their incomes on kerosene, candles, phone charging services, and toxic dry cell batteries for radios.\n\nSCODE has also developed an innovative Solar Energy Demonstration Project, which is intended to reassure consumers of the reliability of solar technology and to build local capacity for after-sales service. This targeted program helps to demystify the technology, localize it, and encourage more entrepreneurs and families to invest in it. The project trains local electricians on solar PV installation and maintenance, while ensuring end-users have knowledge of proper use and preventative maintenance.\n\nJohn and his small team have sold over 200 BrightBox systems in the last few months, and they have several potential customers asking for systems without means of affording them. With your help, SCODE will be able to offer BrightBox with extended financing to low-income end-users who want to break the cycle of constantly buying polluting, unhealthy, and unsafe energy.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":13925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":13925,"image":{"id":1475255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":13925,"lender_count":393,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":13920,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":13925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":13920}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":13925,"local_amount":13920,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-06T09:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":13925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468017222}],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T06:31:10Z","paid_date":"2014-05-06T09:20:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637085,"name":"Irine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irine is a Kiva borrower.

lives of farmers throughout Kenya.  His work involves building market linkages with suppliers of environmentally friendly products that are needed within local communities, and bringing them to areas with little access to these technologies.  Over the last several years, Laban has brought access to sustainable energy and poverty-alleviating products to thousands of farmers who earn a living from growing flowers and raising livestock.  \n\nLaban's product line includes solar energy solutions as well as clean cook stoves, both of which are sold directly on farms and in open-air markets. Through local demonstrations, Laban's team engages local communities in understanding the positive aspects of solar when compared to traditional energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and disposable batteries.  With years of experience selling a variety of solar products, Laban has built a reputation as a trusted reseller in his community.\n\nLaban began working with One Degree\u2019s team in Kenya in 2012 after hearing about BrightBox, a new solar energy kit that powers lights, phones, and radios.   Since September 2012, Laban has already sold over 250 BrightBox systems to his customers.  He already has requests for many more, which he would like to provide before the holidays.  While happy with his initial success, Laban has been selling to farmers on a regular cash basis, while many others cannot afford to pay upfront. These same farmers are often stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging.\n\nTo break this cycle and make renewable energy accessible to these customers, Laban would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those who need it most, while also increasing his inventory on hand to serve more customers.  He seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nLaban will use funds for 50 BrightBoxes, which will be used to energize and empower households across his region. Customers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them upfront or over several months. Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Laban will help families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1474612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3870,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3875,"local_amount":3870,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-06T09:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468017224}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T18:07:20Z","paid_date":"2014-05-06T09:20:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":635899,"name":"Maria Irma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nA sus 44 a\u00f1os de edad Mar\u00eda trabaja muy duro para sacar llevar el sustento diario a su hogar.

With them, Marizabel hopes to be able to better understand her subjects. Marizabel currently works 25 hours a week but making time to work and go to school has been one of her biggest challenges. At her job, Marizabel earns $4 a day but with a degree in culinary arts, she expects to earn $15 a day.

The parents are proud of their children, as they grew up to be good people. The residents of the village where Abdanbek and his family live speak very warmly about them. He is a very responsible person, a good husband and a loving father. Abdanbek has a high school education and is currently on a pension, but despite that continues to work shifts as a guard. \r\n\r\nTo earn extra income for his family, Abdanbek works in animal husbandry, a business he began 30 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 1,000 KGS. Thanks to his hard work, his holding now contains one milk cow and 10 sheep as well as a small plot from which he receives a rich annual harvest of produce including strawberries, raspberries and various types of apple. Not everyone can raise such fruits and berries - they need special care. Abdanbek takes care of these berries and fruits with great attention and love, and therefore his harvest is always excellent. He also has 1.08 hectares of agricultural land on which he grows beans and potatoes.\r\n\r\nAbdanbek's children and wife actively help him on the land. The family is happy and hardworking. Their monthly income is 15,000 KGS. Abdanbek is the second member of three in the group Zeta-2. With the goal of further developing his business, Abdanbek has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 25,000 KGS to purchase sheep to increase his head count. He plans to invest profits from the loan into further augmentation of his herd, and to save up for his youngest son's wedding.

In Drogobych, she sells roasted chicken, blini (thin pancakes with filling), hot dogs, french fries, juices, coffee, tea and ice cream. Her shop is located right in the middle of the largest part of the market. The location is really great and filled with people. The majority of her customers are people who come from neighboring villages and Transcarpathia to sell cheese, milk, herbs, seedlings and sprouts. Renata began her business relatively recently -  just one year ago. She rents the premises on which she works. Renata plans to use the additional funds in the amount of 5000 hryvnia to buy food products for her small caf\u00e9.

\n\n","en":"Almagul is 52 years old, widowed, and is raising three children by herself. Almagul has a secondary education. She is a homemaker. After the death of her husband, it took her a long time to recover, as she had lost she the person closest to her and her family's breadwinner. Thanks to her children, she gradually came round. The first of the tasks and problems she needed to figure out was how to feed her children and family. She decided to take up animal breeding, as all of her fellow villagers do.  \r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Almagul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Almagul's hard work and the active assistance from her children, she currently has 2 calves and 40 sheep on her farm, as well as a 1.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans and potatoes. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). Almugal entered into the farming group \"Zeta-2.\" There are already 2 people in this group; she is the third member. \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of further developing her business, Almagul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy bulls to increase the size of her herd. Almagul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to buy a plot of land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1476582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is in a de facto relationship and has completed primary school education, thanks to the financial and moral support of her parents. Virginia is mother to two young children who are studying at a school in the community. She has worked in agriculture sowing potatoes for ten years after having learnt from her parents, both of whom carry on the family tradition of farming, and she still works on the farm together with her partner. The land that she and her partner tend to is their own and is situated very close by to their house. This allows them to work as a couple and keep an eye on their crops by clearing the land and adding fertiliser and foliar feed, both of which help to strengthen, care for and develop their crops. \r\n\r\nVirgina's goals are to amass a good amount of potatoes to generate excellent profits from her crops which she can then reinvest again in her crops, but this time a little freer of responsibilities. Her dreams as a mother are to support her children until they complete their studies and to meet all their needs and anything else that comes up on their life journey.\r\n\r\nVirginia is currently seeking a loan to buy supplies such as manure and fertiliser to help her with her current potato crop. Thanks to this loan she will be able to improve and stabilise her financial situation while hoping to get a good harvest of potatoes out of her crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1476138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Tynar has a higher education. She and her husband work as teachers at a local school and are well-respected in their village, as they both are good people and professional educators. They are good role models, as they not only work in a school, but also simultaneously practice animal breeding and cultivate a 3.0 hectare plot of land. \r\n\r\nTynar was the initiator of all this, starting this business business 20 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Tynar's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 4 calves, 20 sheep and 1 horse on her farm, as well as a 3.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows pumpkins, potatoes and perennial grasses. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). Tynar is in the agricultural group \"Diana.\" There are two other members in this group; Tynar is the second member of the group. \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of further developing her business, Tynar turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy heifers to increase the size of her herd. Tynar plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to buy a house for her eldest son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1476741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy heifers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T11:50:30Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T11:50:30Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":65.97,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tynar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":101.75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5035.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":467831037},{"amount":384.63,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":20140.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.87,"payment_id":579488701},{"amount":179.93,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10070.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.32,"payment_id":624798779},{"amount":92.72,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5035.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.4,"payment_id":664995297}],"funded_date":"2013-12-04T18:35:43Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":637418,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is 20 years old.

I am single and do not have kids. I am the oldest at home. I have a sister and two brothers, aged 14, 15 and 17. \r\n\r\nWhen I was fifteen my parents got divorced and my mother had to cover all the expenses at home. My father receives an income and has other businesses; my mother babysits and administers a workshop.\r\n\r\nI am studying medicine at UCATECI. I am interested in this profession because it demands from people to be humble, responsible and to care about others, among other values. Besides, it requires a lot of dedication and gives you the opportunity to show you love your neighbors.\r\n\r\nThis loan is of great importance in order to cover my needs at the university. In case I do not get it, I would have to interrupt my studies because I do not have the resources to continue since it costs a lot to do so. This is to say that it would totally change my life to get it and I would have the strengths I need to pursue my degree. Ever since I was a girl I have dreamt of becoming a doctor.\r\n\r\nOne of my goals is to be able to become a successful professional, specialized in Pediatrics. Once I have all the tools, I will be able to perform an excellent job and honor my city and my country."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1476170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She did very well in secondary school. After graduating from secondary school, she got married which is why she did not get a higher education. She always dreamed that her children would get a higher education. Her daughter is studying at Tajik State Commercial University. She is a first-year student.

His mother, who helps them around the house and taking care of their son, lives with them. Urmat is the family\u2019s main  breadwinner; he raises livestock and farms. He started doing this five years ago, when he bought a cow for 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to his hard work, his farm now has 1 dairy cow, 10 sheep, and 1 horse. He also has 1.5 hectares of land on which he grows beans, potatoes, and clover. Their monthly income is 6,000 som (KGS). Urmat is joining the Diana group, which has two other members.  With the goal of further developing his business, Urmat has turned to the Bai-Tushum & Partners micro lending bank for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy bulls for increasing the size of his herd. He plans on investing the income earned with the loan onto further increasing his livestock herd, and plans on saving up money to build a new house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1476829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bulls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T13:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T13:50:07Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":65.97,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urmat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":101.75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5035.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":467831038},{"amount":384.63,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":20140.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.87,"payment_id":579488702},{"amount":179.93,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10070.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.32,"payment_id":624798780},{"amount":92.72,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5035.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.4,"payment_id":664995298}],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T15:04:03Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peter and Lynne Weil","image":null}},{"id":637451,"name":"Petesa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petesa is 45 years old, married, and has five children.

After her husband died, she became the sole breadwinner for her four children. Tuhtajon is an honest worker and works as a cleaner at the local hospital, but it is hard to raise her children on her small salary. Now that her sons are grown they help her provide for the family. Tuhtajon is always trying to improve her family's living conditions. She wants to renovate her house because it is in bad condition, but she doesn't have the means. Tuhtajon applied for a loan with IMON to buy building materials to fix her home. This is her second loan, and she repaid her first loan on time. She awaits your kindness.

She is from the city of Dushanbe. Vazira takes orders for sewing clothing. Her mastery of this was learned from her mother. But Vazira's mother is not herself engaged in sewing. She works in a kindergarten as a teacher. But when she spends time at home, she helps Vazira with her work. Vazira works at home. Tajik women prefer to wear custom dresses. Therefore sewing services and dressmaking are in demand. <br \/><br \/>For almost four years, Vazira has been engaged in such activities and is satisfied with her work, but her sewing machine is seriously outdated and she wants to buy a new machine with the money from the loan.

She lives in a humble home of her own and learned to make artisan griddles and clay pots a long time ago and this has been her main source of income.  She does this daily and thanks to her charisma, she has been able to win the trust of many customers who prefer to buy from her.\r\n\r\nThe roof over her house is damaged and she needs to replace it as soon as possible, so she is asking for a loan through FUSAI so she can buy galvanized metal, lumber, and pay for labor.

The children are all students; the eldest is 13 years old, and the youngest is 9. Urkuya has a specialized high school education, and graduated from a technical school with the specialty of cook. Her husband is engaged in offering passenger services to the local population. <br \/><br \/>The family is young and friendly. The spouses have been teaching the children from a young age all the good qualities such as industriousness. After school, the children help their parents. As a main source of income for her family, Urkuya is engaged in raising livestock, having started 12 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Urkuya currently has on her homestead: two dairy cows, one calf, and 30 sheep, and also has a 2.1-hectare share of land, on which annually she grows peppers, beans and clover. Monthly income consists of 12,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Urkuya turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tusham and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows to increase her cattle head count. <br \/><br \/>Urkuya plans to invest income from the loan in further increasing the quantity of domestic livestock, and plans to save money for the further education of her children. Urkuya considers herself an exemplary mother and a happy mother."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1476859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balasary village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":59.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urkuya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":821.49,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":40280.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.51,"payment_id":529946983},{"amount":769.25,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":40280.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":55.75,"payment_id":579488705}],"funded_date":"2014-01-06T03:07:18Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":637523,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is 61 years old and married with three children.

She is in a civil union, and her partner is both a builder and a farmer. She completed primary school. The couple lives alone in their house, as they have no children. Carminda has a shop but works on the family farm during the week, helping her partner tend to the coffee crops. On weekends, she sells fruits and vegetables in her area's town market. The couple bought the plot of land thanks to money inherited from their respective parents. They grow a great variety of crops, and the land is located some 3 kilometres from their house. They go there by foot, since there is no other transport available. Carminda hopes for an excellent harvest this year, since the household's finances depend on it. They sell the coffee to middlemen who come to their village. Her main goal in asking for this loan is to buy fertiliser, various types of manure, and fungicides, in order to avoid the spread of disease ruining the crops. Her plans for the future are to invest part of the profits from the sale of the harvest in order to increase the area covered by her coffee crops, since they still have a free plot of land available. She intends to plant a better variety of coffee, named 'caturra', which is more fragile but sells much better on the market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1476209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies to grow coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T15:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T15:50:11Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carminda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2015-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":12312,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762849}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T23:14:51Z","paid_date":"2015-02-26T10:25:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637538,"name":"Razia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Razia, age 38, deals in the business of animal sales.

She is a very hardworking woman who is known for her honesty and responsibility.  Bernarda has a business making and selling tortillas.  She also has a small store in her home.  These businesses are essential to the finances of her household, because her husband is a small farmer and his harvest comes only once a year, which means that his sales are made only in one season.  Thanks to both of their efforts, the family is getting ahead and striving to improve their living conditions.  \r\n\r\nBernarda wants to build a porch on her house so that water doesn't enter the home when it rains and damage their minimal belongings.

In her childhood, she had to deal with the separation of her parents, and with living with her older brother.  When he was very young, her brother met 2 friends who led him into being a criminal who led a deceitful, antisocial lifestyle.  He stole, and then got to the point where he tried, and then allowed his life to be destroyed by, hallucinogenic drugs. Years later, Diana met a young man who was older than she was, and became pregnant by him.  He then abandoned her, without any concern for the fate of the child.  Later, in order to get ahead, she took a job helping an acquaintance sell fruit in the streets of the city.  In this way she was able to help her mother pay the bills and to support her child.  She then met another young man, with whom she began living and had a second child.  However, after a while he began to abuse her physically and verbally, so Diana decided to leave their home.

They are hardworking and responsible women. They took a loan of 150,000 YER.\r\n\r\nZainb is 51 years old, married, and lives together with her family in a poor area of Aden, Yemen. She works hard as an employee in the public sector, but earns a low salary that is not enough to cover the household expenses.
