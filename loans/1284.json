She has four children: two are in school, while two have finished school. <p>\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, for three years in her area, she has been running several businesses, including a beauty salon, a mini supermarket, Max malipo, and a transportation business. She works from 8 am to 10 pm everyday, which allows her to earn good monthly profits. <p>\r\n\r\nThis would be Salama's third loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans to start Max malipo, restock her supermarket, and open a beauty salon. Proudly, she notes that she fully repaid both of her prior loans. She used the profits generated as a result of the prior loans to pay school fees and household expenses, and she saved the remaining funds in her bank account. She would like to use the requested loan proceeds to restock missing items in the supermarket and to increase her stock of salon equipment. In the future, she dreams of building her own house. <p>\r\n\r\nSalama will share this loan with her loan group, FAITH.

She is requesting this loan to help cover tuition costs for her degree. This is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Danilsa, and I am 18 years old. I was born and raised in Santo Domingo, and I currently live there with my parents and siblings. I am the third of five children in our family, and we all live in a small house in the Azul de los R\u00edos neighborhood.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I was very young, I loved school and academic work. I always put forth my best effort in all my classes, and as a result I am now studying Business Administration at O&M University. I am in my third semester of the program, and my favorite course subjects thus far include: administration, accounting and financial mathematics. I chose this career specifically because I love all the practical applications of Business Administration: working with clients, business concepts, being on a team with coworkers and the responsibility that comes along with being a professional and an entrepreneur. I can't imagine myself in any other field, and I hope to leverage my education and professional skills to support my family and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nMy family is facing several financial challenges and strains at the moment, so a loan like this gives me the best chance to be able to stay in my university program. As a family of seven with five children, my mother works as a cook in a private home and my father works on contract with a decorations company. Both of them make minimum wage and are no longer able to help me with tuition costs. I sincerely thank you in advance for your support and generosity, and for the opportunity to pursue my degree and my life dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1476300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

aspiring businessman. He is only 20 years old. He wants to start a business buying and selling cattle. Faridun, despite his young age and lack of experience, is not afraid to start a business. This is because most people in Istravshan work in animal husbandry. Faridun knows that he can go to his neighbors for advice whenever he needs it. Faridun's parents also work in animal husbandry, but they are keeping their animals to take care of their personal needs. Faridun plans to use all of the experience he has gained from his parents in his own business. \r\n\r\nTo start the business, Faridun must buy several head of cattle. Unfortunately, he doesn't have enough money to buy the cattle, so he is asking for a loan. This loan is very important to Faridun. Faridun is waiting for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1476961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"start a new business buying and selling cattle by buying some cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faridun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":41.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":49.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":59.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":65.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":67.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":68.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449683260}],"funded_date":"2014-01-25T17:28:40Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T12:25:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":637130,"name":"Tuuraay Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abibatu is the featured leader of this group of entrepreneurs.

These stoves eliminate smoke from the home, reduce wood consumption by 50%, and save families time collecting firewood. His E'Copan stove factory employs six people and has sold more than 5,000 stoves in three years. Prior to becoming a 'stover,' Anibal worked in agroforestry and served as vice mayor of the town of Copan Ruinas. \n\nAnibal would like to expand his business throughout Honduras in order to reach more families who are still cooking over dangerous open fires. In order to do this, Anibal is requesting a Kiva loan to create a distribution center in Ocotepeque, Honduras.

She is 26 years old, has a one-year-old son, and owns her own business. The community of Sugura village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Sugura\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Sugura, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Doreen has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Teresia, Miriam, Josephine and Beatrice.\n\nSugura village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Doreen believes that the dispenser will save people from sickness and death in her community. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Doreen\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T18:30:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doreen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T20:13:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":629557,"name":"Grace's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace, a 53-year-old woman with 5 children, lives in Shivembe B village in Kisasi, Kenya.

chlorine dispenser. James is a friendly, hard-working, reliable, well-liked member of the community with 6 children. James lives with his family in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nGambo village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from an unprotected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. James and the 15 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nJames has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. James volunteered to be the promoter because want to improve the community's health and he wants to help the community to kill bacteria and promote health. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: John, Everlyne, Dorcas and Batrimayo.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that James\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T19:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T19:10:07Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batrimayo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T01:53:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637592,"name":"Asma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asma is age 27 and lives with her family in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

children. He lives in Gimudi village in Vihiga in Kenya. Gimudi village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Stephen and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nStephen grows crops for food, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Stephen and other promoters in his community (including: Thomas, Francis, David and Sarah) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Stephen will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. He wants to be a promoter because he likes serving the community. Stephen believes that the dispenser will provide chlorine that kills bacteria and hence prevents illness.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

She lives with her 4 children in Kakubutu village in Vihiga, Kenya. The community of Kakubutu village collects their drinking water from an unprotected well because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kakubutu\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Kakubutu, 12 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Susan has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Rose, Elizabeth, Emma and Josephine.\n\nKakubutu village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Susan believes that the dispenser will help to prevent waterborne diseases.

Jebrongo village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Hesbon and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nHesbon works as a day\/hired laborer, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Hesbon and other promoters in his community (including Vincent, Violet, Hildah and Laban) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Hesbon will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. He wants to be a promoter because he lives near the waterpoint and knows he can care for the dispenser well. Hesbon believes that the dispenser will prevent diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Hesbon\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1467159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T19:30:07Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hesbon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hildah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laban ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-01T20:51:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637676,"name":"Nigesa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nigesa is a widowed woman who has been blessed with six children, all of whom are adults.

Microfinance. The group has 15 members and most of the group members are businessmen and women. Mabel is 43 years old, a mother of five and a businesswoman dealing in hiring tents and chairs. She started the business in 2011 and she has carried it on to date. Her business is located in Ishaka Town and her clients are mainly people in Ishaka and the neighboring towns. She applied for 800,000 shillings to be able to buy more chairs for hire.

iron roof in Musanyi village in Kenya, Kenya. The community of Musanyi village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Musanyi\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Musanyi, 60 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Dorine has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Eglay, Simon, Ronald, and Florence.\n\nMusanyi village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Dorine believes that the dispenser will kill germs. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Dorine\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T19:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T19:50:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eglay ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T13:18:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637672,"name":"Together Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These four ladies are part of a group called \u2018Together\u2019 and are starting their fifth loan cycle with ID Ghana and second with Kiva.

She says she started this business on the advice of her parents. She buys the drinks from the wholesale depot and resells to customers. She is requesting this loan to increase her merchandise and to purchase more drinks to sell. This type of work allows her to generate an income to support her family since she is married with three children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about ID Ghana, she responded that she likes working with the group and the savings opportunities with the organization. The group needs a total loan amount of 4,600 GHS to increase their stock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1478207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

Kenya. Gamgoi village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a river, stream, or other flowing water source. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Beatrice and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nBeatrice works as a subsistence\/peasant farmer, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Beatrice and other promoters in her community (including Janet and Phanike) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Beatrice will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Beatrice wants to be a promoter because she is loved by community, and she believes that the dispenser will save lives.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Beatrice\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T19:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T19:50:06Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phanike ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T00:10:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637681,"name":"Ahlam's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahlam is a 48-year-old Iraqi woman with a small, home based sewing business activity.

The community of Kaptaisi village collects their drinking water from an unprotected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kaptaisi\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Kaptaisi, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Susan has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Janet, Beatrice and Aggrey.\n\nKaptaisi village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser. Everlyne is friendly and an active member of the village prayer group with 7 children.  Everlyne lives with her family in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nLiavola village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink.  Everlyne and the 40 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nEverlyne has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. She volunteered to be the promoter because it makes her community grow and she wants to help the community because she believes chlorine will improve their health and as a result less hospital expenses will be incurred. There are also two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Mercy and Hezron.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that  Everlyne\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T20:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T20:10:05Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hezron ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T17:55:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":629810,"name":"Joyce's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce lives in a home with mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof in Wanalo village in Vihiga, Kenya with her 3 children.

The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Wanalo, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Joyce has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Catherine, Tabitha, Violet and Terry.\n\nWanalo village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Joyce believes that the dispenser will help the community's hygiene. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Joyce\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T20:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T20:10:05Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tabitha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Terry ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T13:23:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":629914,"name":"Kenga Development Association Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nPulikeria is 46 and is married with 4 children aged 13, 15, 17 and 19.

She has a professional degree as an administrative assistant and typist and also received a retail associate certificate from a business college. For a while Elmira worked as a secretary for various organizations, but when she married she stopped working, focusing on managing the household and raising her children. Elmira has a large family: two sons and two daughters. The kids, with the exception of the youngest son, are married and live separately. The youngest son still lives with his parents and actively helps them with the household. Elmira's husband is a taxi driver and the main income for the family comes from their livestock herd. The family farm was started 21 years ago with 3,500 som (KGS) and has now expanded to include: one milk cow, one calf, two horses, 15 sheep, 25 turkeys, 30 chickens and 8.8 acres of land where the family grows beans, potatoes and hay. During winter, Elmira also sells the milk from her cow and horses, generating additional income. The monthly income from the farm is 9,500 som (KGS). In order to further expand the livestock business, Elmira has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan. She plans to use the loan to buy a steer for the herd. Elmira will use profits from this expansion to buy more animals and eventually save enough money to build a house for her son.\r\n

husband. All of her children are now married and live independently, except for the middle son, who lives in Jumabubu's house together with his wife and kids. Her youngest son and his wife are working in Kasahstan. Jumabubu has a high school diploma and raises livestock, which is the main source of income for her family. The livestock business was started 12 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS). Due to Jumabubu's diligent work, her herd has now expanded to: one milk cow, 5 horses and 20 sheep, and the animals provide the family with 12,000 som (KGS) monthly profit. Jumabubu's husband actively helps her with the livestock. Every morning he takes the animals out to pasture, while Jumabubu cleans out the barn, changes water and puts up hey. The two work happily together. In order to further expand the herd Jumabubu has applied for a loan to micro-finance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to finance the purchase of another horse. She plans to continue investing the profits from the loan into the livestock business, continue expanding her herd and save money to help pay for the education of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1478818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a horse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balasary village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":16500},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":16500},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":17000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":338.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":338.25,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":16516.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553257},{"amount":333.75,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":16516.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.5,"payment_id":467831041},{"amount":348.5,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":17017.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749627}],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T23:32:13Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T09:50:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637715,"name":"Aren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aren is from Vanadzor town where he lives with his mother.

Elizabeth volunteered to be the promoter because she believes it is good to assist others and she wants to help the community to fight germs that cause waterborne diseases. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Grace, Sarah and Pauline.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Elizabeth\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative

She has no children but is planning to start a family soon. The community of Matrini B village collects their drinking water from a municipal water supply because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Matrini B\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Matrini B, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Terry has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. Two other volunteer promoters (Gladys and Ronald) from the surrounding community are part of this group loan.\n\nMatrini B village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Terry believes that the dispenser will provide safe water which will improve health and help prevent diseases. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Terry\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative

Two of her kids are school age and two are still babies. Her youngest son isn't even one year old yet. Gulshan has a high school degree, she is a home maker and raises her children, as well as takes care of her small farm. The farm is the main source of income for the family and was started 13 years ago with the 10,000 som (KGS). Due to Gulshan's diligent work the family now owns two milk cows, two calves, 10 chickens and has 3 acres of land where they grow potatoes and beans. Gulshan's husband is a taxi driver and also works as a mechanic at a auto repair shop. Since the kids are all still young, Gulshan's husband works hard to save money for their future and is a very active father. The total monthly income of the family is 10,000 som (KGS). In order to expand the livestock herd, Gulshan has turned to micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase another cow. She plans to use the profits from the loan to continue expanding the family's herd and save money for her children's college education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1478871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nyldy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T20:50:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":83.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulshan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":101.13,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5005.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.37,"payment_id":467831043},{"amount":477.92,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25025.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.58,"payment_id":561578131},{"amount":178.85,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10010.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.15,"payment_id":624798782},{"amount":175.31,"local_amount":9509.78,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":9519.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.64,"payment_id":664995300},{"amount":8.6,"local_amount":490.22,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:54:14Z","rounded_local_amount":490.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.45,"payment_id":681291731}],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T02:16:43Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T12:54:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637729,"name":"Anahit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anahit is from Sisian town.

She sells food and lunches from her stand which is located in the Santa Rosa zone. This loan is her first with the institution, and Shirley will use it for the maintenance and repair of her stand. She will also buy work material for her business. \r\n\r\nShirley's reason for requesting this loan is that she needs to repair her kiosk and also cement the base of the stand. She faces such challenges in her business as having to get up to prepare the food very early when it's cold out, and she is prone to catching rheumatism which is very common among people who do this work. She will use the proceeds to buy supplies, and tables and chairs so she can sell more comfortably and offer good service to her customers. Her wish for her business is to have a more varied and larger menu so she can sell more and better products and thus get ahead in

daughters and a son with her husband. Chinar's husband is now retired. Chinar herself has a high-school degree and manages the family farm, which is their main source of income. The farm was started 20 years ago with a purchase of a cow with 2,000 som (KGS). Chinar's hard work and the help of her children have grown the farm and the family now owns 5 milk cows, 3 calves, 40 sheep, 1 horse and 12 acres of land where they grow beans, potatoes and hay. Every year the family collects an abundant harvest because Chinar has a lot of experience growing crops. She takes care of her fields day and night so that she can improve the financial lot of her family. Chinar also has a veterinarian examine her animals twice a year and puts up all the hay and feed for her livestock together with her children.  In summary, Chinar has all the facilities and equipment to take care of livestock. The monthly income from the farm is 8,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her herd, Chinar has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy more sheep. She will use the profits from the loan to buy more livestock and save money for her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1478883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nyldy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:10:20Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":82.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chinar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":101.13,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5005.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.37,"payment_id":467831044},{"amount":477.92,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25025.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.58,"payment_id":561578132},{"amount":178.85,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10010.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.15,"payment_id":624798783},{"amount":184.35,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10010.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.65,"payment_id":664995301}],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T16:17:17Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":636543,"name":"Luz Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luz, es originaria de la ciudad de Estel\u00ed, tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, casada y madre de un hijo.

Joash is a friendly, goal-oriented, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, well-known and well-liked member of the community with 6 children. Joash lives with his family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor, and an iron roof.\n\nChimusien village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Joash and the 20 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nJoash has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Joash volunteered to be the promoter because he is willing to serve the community and he wants to help the community by killing bacteria thus making the drinking water safe. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Samson, Emily, and Escah.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Joash\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative

She is actively involved in an agricultural business and cultivates a piece of land where maize is grown. Natia sells her produce locally. Besides that, she breeds a milk cow and a calf. Natia makes cheese in the grazing season, when her cow milks well and then she sells products from her house. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet her increasing family expenses, Natia decided to start new business. Natia has noticed a high demand for used clothing in the market as local people can\u2019t afford to buy new clothing due to their poverty.

The community of Senende village collects their drinking water from an unprotected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Senende\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Senende, 15 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mary has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. Two other volunteer promoters (Joan and Henry) from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan.\n\nSenende village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Mary believes that the dispenser will provide safe water that will help prevent waterborne diseases. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Mary\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T16:23:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637754,"name":"Salome","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salome lives in Mariakani area near Mombasa, Kenya.

raising her five children alone. After the death of her husband Toraim's family lost their main provider. After asking her children for advice, Toraim agreed to send her eldest son and his wife to Russia for work. Her son and daughter-in-law live and work in Russia and send a part of their earning back to the family every month. The rest of the children still live with Toraim and help around the house. Toraim has a high school degree and she manages dairy business, which is the main source of income for the family.  The dairy business was started 18 years ago with a purchase of a cow with 8,000 som (KGS). Toraim's hard work has grown the herd and the family now owns 8 milk cows. Toraim and her daughters milk all the cows and sell the milk. The monthly income from the farm is 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her herd, Toraim has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy another milk cow. She will use the profits from the loan to buy more livestock and save money to improve her family's well-being.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1478894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a milk cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhiyde village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.27,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toraim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":15106.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053474},{"amount":288.49,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":15106.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.88,"payment_id":561578133},{"amount":188.86,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10071.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.39,"payment_id":649513464}],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T01:39:43Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637743,"name":"Varduhi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Varduhi has been involved in retail business for a year already.

She is \"Mother Hero\", as she is raising six children. Her husband works as a specialist at the farming co-op's office. Kanyshay herself has a college degree and works as a teacher in the local school. She is liked and respected by other villagers. Kanyshay has educated many generations of children and some of them have become doctors, teachers, economists and chefs. Her students say that she is a smart and fair teacher and a thoughtful and idealistic human being. Even now Kanyshay is teaching many students because she loves her work. Unfortunately the salary of a teacher is not enough to feed her family and Kanyshay is earning additional income by raising livestock and farming. She started 20 years ago by buying livestock with 8,000 som KGS. Kanyshay's hard work has grown the farm to include 6 milk cows, 15 sheep and a small plot of land where she grows sunflowers. Every fall Kanyshay takes her harvest to a pressing plant and has own sunflower seed oil for family's consumption. The monthly income from the livestock is 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further expand her herd, Kanyshay has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy more cattle. She will use the profits from the loan to continue expanding the herd and save money to repair the family's home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1478906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhiyde village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":62.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanyshay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":621.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":621.43,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":30344.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053475},{"amount":386.32,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:03Z","rounded_local_amount":20229.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.96,"payment_id":561578134},{"amount":379.37,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":20229.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.92,"payment_id":649513465}],"funded_date":"2014-01-06T03:47:39Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":629890,"name":"Julias' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julias lives in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof in Musunji village in Vihiga, Kenya with his family. He is 49 years old and has 8 children. The community of Musunji village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Musunji\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Musunji, 15 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Julias has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Isaiah and Emmy.\n\nMusunji village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Julias believes that the dispenser will promote good health. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Julias\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:30:06Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julias ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaiah ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-29T03:33:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":629875,"name":"Rose's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 47 years old, has 4 sons, and lives in Gamgeni village in Vihiga, Kenya.

Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

She is 42 years old and has a son and 4 daughters. The community of Chebunaywa village collects their drinking water from an unprotected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of Vihiga Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Chebunaywa\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Chebunaywa, 66 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mary has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Felix, Erick and Nancy.\n\nChebunaywa village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Mary believes that the dispenser will prevent diseases and keep the community healthy and able to work hard to create wealth. She looks forward to her neighbors not having to spend a lot of time and money in the hospital so they can spend time and money on other important uses. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

","en":"Sheraly is a caring father and a loving husband. He is 28 years old and lives with his family in southern Tajikistan. Sheraly has started his business four years ago. He purchases fabrics wholesale, distributes them among seamstresses who make traditional Tajik dresses from home. Sheraly then sells the dresses at the local market from his own market stall. Every season Sheraly changes the inventory of dresses he has for sale to keep his store competitive. His wife helps Sheraly in this business. Now, with the fall and winter season upon us, Sheraly needs to refresh his inventory but he doesn't have money for a wholesale purchase of fabrics. Sheraly has turned to KIVA for a loan of 3000 somoni which he will use to buy fabrics.

","en":"Mahmadabror was born in 1963 in the city of Norak. He is married and lives with his wife and their four children, who are in school. He has raised farm animals for nearly his entire life. When he was a child he helped his father send cattle to pasture every morning. Now Mahmadabror raises cattle on his own, continuing the work of his father and grandfather.

Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

","en":"Dilnoza is a young and goal-oriented 24 year old woman. She is not married and lives with her parents. After finishing high school Dilnoza was not accepted to the university, so she has no college degree. Currently, she works as a cleaning lady in a school. Her mother is also a cleaning lady at the same school. They work together. Dilnoza dreams of getting accepted to college so that she can earn a college diploma. Since her childhood Dilnoza wanted to live in a beautiful house, but her parents are poor and they could never save enough to repair it. Now Dilnoza plans to pay for the repairs herself. For this reason she is requesting a loan of 2000 somoni which she will use to purchase cement, lumber and other building supplies. Dilnoza hopes for your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1478925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy building materials such as cement and lumber for repairing her house ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kurgantyube","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilnoza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":142.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":142.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":150.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":157.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":155.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":171.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":179.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":183.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":188.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":194.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.56,"local_amount":148.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":150.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989816},{"amount":32,"local_amount":150.6,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":152.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449626791},{"amount":29.71,"local_amount":139.81,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":141.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459093252},{"amount":35.94,"local_amount":169.13,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":171.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468205140},{"amount":32.94,"local_amount":154.99,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":157.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480220064},{"amount":35.81,"local_amount":168.53,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":170.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490822461},{"amount":36.31,"local_amount":170.87,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":173.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504248027},{"amount":36.41,"local_amount":171.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":173.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517531319},{"amount":38.06,"local_amount":179.11,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":181.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531768287},{"amount":39.55,"local_amount":186.1,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":188.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542505985},{"amount":76.71,"local_amount":361.03,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":366.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561639395}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T11:03:21Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T11:43:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637644,"name":"Jenelen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenelen is 39 years old and has four children, three of whom are in school.

Grace is a goal-oriented, hard-working, well-liked member of the community with 5 children. Grace lives with her family in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, iron roof.\n\nMahanga B village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Grace and the 20 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nGrace has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Grace volunteered to be the promoter because she didn't want to let the community down and she wants to help the community by killing germs in water. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Nancy, Carolyne, Mary and Catherine.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.

Sadullo is the main provider of the family as his wife is a home maker and his kids are still small. Sadullo has been working as a taxi driver for three years. As he lives in a remote region, the complex geographical structure of the area prevents the development of public transport. Because of this, Sadullo has many clients and is always trying to attract more clients as well as improve his service and make it affordable. To keep the fuel costs down Sadullo wants to improve his vehicle and install a natural gas fuel system, for which he requires this loan. He is requesting a loan of 1700 somoni.

He has worked as a taxi driver for over fifteen years, driving his own car. He lives with his wife, who is a doctor by profession. Currently the car that Edik has been running as a taxi is damaged. He was able to save money for purchasing a new one, but because of his family's poor conditions wasn't able to save the whole needed amount. Now, by applying for this loan, Edik asks for a loan of AMD 500,000 to be able to purchase a new car and continue his taxi-driving business. Edik has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan will help Edik very much and he hopes for lenders'

Bermet became a widow very early and was left without a provider and a husband, and her children - without a father. It was hard to stop grieving the loss of her closest friend, but Bermet took a hold of herself and made plans. How would she feed her family now? How will she raise her children? How will she provide all six children with an education? After discussing all of this with her children, the family decided to send the eldest son to the capital of Kyrgyzstan. Bermet gave her meager savings to her son and he was able to use that money to start a retail business at one of the markets. He has been having good luck and is able to send money monthly back to the village. Bermet is also working hard to provide for her children - she has a dairy business. The herd was started 20 years ago with 10,000 KGD. Bermet's hard work has expanded the herd to five milk cows and yields monthly profits of 10,000 som KGS. In order to further expand her herd, Bermet has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy more cows. She will use the profits from the loan to buy more livestock and save money for home repairs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1478956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Zamira has a high school education and lives with her spouse and mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law is a pensioner and her husband helps with the housework. Zamira is the main source of income for her family from raising livestock, which she began three years ago by buying a cow for 10,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni. Thanks to Zamira's hard work, her farm now has two cattle and 15 sheep. Also she has her garden at home in which she has planted many fruit trees, such as: apricot, persimmon, and pomegranate. Also she has a small plot of land on which to grow barley, wheat, corn, and tomatoes. Zamira together with her spouse, prepared for a very good harvest because they have experience, and most importantly, they put their heart and soul into their work. Every day early in the morning Zamira's husband drives the cattle to pasture and gives them to the shepherd, every night the cattle return home. During this time, Zamira cleans the barn, harvests hay, and gets fresh water. Twice a year Zamira sheers the sheep for wool. Their monthly income is 10,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni. In order to further develop their farm, Zamira appealed to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to purchase sheep for livestock breeding. With the income from the loan, Zamira plans to invest further in multiplying their amount of domesticated animals, and plans to accumulate funds for material support of the family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1479077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kulundu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":43.94,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":505.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25028.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.34,"payment_id":459019718},{"amount":0.12,"local_amount":5.75,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749629},{"amount":512.38,"local_amount":24994.25,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25022.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178353},{"amount":510.43,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25028.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.07,"payment_id":529946986},{"amount":477.97,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25028.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.53,"payment_id":579488709}],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T01:31:12Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Terrin","image":225925}},{"id":637797,"name":"Tsu-Shitoo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These females are part of a group called 'Tsu-shitoo' group and are into the sale of clothing, provisions, cutlery sets and fish.

They live together with Ainur's parents, who are retired. Despite their age, Ainur's parents help her with her business. Ainur has secondary education. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Ainur works with livestock breeding, after having started five years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ainur's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow with offspring. Ainur's farm is at her house, where she has conditions for breeding livestock. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Ainur turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase bull-calves to fatten and subsequently sell at the market for a higher price.

She is developing a small business selling the prepared dairy products to neighbors at wholesale prices.\r\n\r\nBahtiyor has loved animals since childhood and takes loving care of them, worrying over each calf. While growing up he began buying, fattening, and reselling cattle and sheep and has continued to this day. He earns additional income selling crops but does not have much land. Crops are seasonal, though, and the family's main income comes from fattening and selling livestock.\r\n\r\nBahtiyor doesn't have enough money to insulate his barn for winter, so he wants to take out a second loan with MDO Arvand in order to buy a stove to warm the barn. Bahtiyor thanks Arvand in advance for their support.

Her husband works as an electrician and receives a small salary, which is not enough to support the whole family. Therefore, as a main source of income for her family, Zeynegul decided to work with livestock breeding, like many other inhabitants in her village. She started 8 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS), and she now has a good income. \r\n\r\nThanks to Zeynegul's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow and 25 sheep, and also a plot of land of 1.60 hectares of land, on which she grows barley and hay. Zeynegul has good conditions for breeding cattle. Currently she and her family already prepared the fodder for her livestock: 2 carts of hay and 100 bundles of pressed hay. She also feeds the livestock with barley which she grows on her plot of land. The monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zeynegul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase foals for fattening and subsequently selling at the market, at a higher price. Zeynegul plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock. She also intends to save money for purchasing a new car for her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1479207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy foals for fattening and reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kum-Dobo village, Naryn region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":208.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeynegul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":919.3,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50056.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":105.7,"payment_id":595435896},{"amount":921.86,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50056.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":103.14,"payment_id":664995302}],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T09:00:37Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":637836,"name":"Adel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adel is a 32-year-old Lebanese married man living with his wife and only child.

She started a business four years ago with the help of the first loan that she received.  She began selling clothing, and then with the help of loans she also began selling wallets and jewelry. This led to increased income and has enabled her to provide a good education for her children.  She goes out to sell her products in the morning since that is when her children are in school, and in the afternoon she needs to help her little ones with their homework.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan mostly to buy clothing, since clothing is what she sells most during this season.  She has been a member of the community bank for four years.  She likes being a member, since thanks to her first loan she was able to start her business, which allowed her to earn some income for the well-being of her children.  She dreams of providing a better life for her little ones."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1476405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":846.31,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":105.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":105.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":105.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":105.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":105.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":105.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":105.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":317.37,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":318.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730366},{"amount":212.51,"local_amount":211.58,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":212.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636447},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":211.58,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":212.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102805},{"amount":106.24,"local_amount":105.78,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":106.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467917683}],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T02:10:54Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T12:27:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Bohnert","image":851467}},{"id":637842,"name":"Mariati","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariati is 20 years old.

Her spouse Almazbek is an independent contractor and takes individual construction orders seasonally. Jypargul has a high school education and raises farm animals as the main income for her family. She began five years ago when she purchased cattle for 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, she now has two dairy cows. In the winter she sells milk from home, which provides a pretty good income. She earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to continue developing her farm, Jypargul asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding. Jypargul plans to use the profit from the loan to invest in more livestock and to save enough money to repair her barn.

He is 25 years old. He has secondary education. His wife is a housewife, engaged with raising the children. This young family lives separately from their parents, but the parents help them when possible. \r\n\r\nKahramon carries the responsibility for his growing family alone. He has his own business. He cooks and sells shashlik (kebabs). He has a good reputation in his industry.

He started working at a local farm after graduating from high school. He is married and has a son. His wife is a homemaker and takes care of the household chores. \r\n\r\nAbdunaim milks the cows himself and sells the milk to neighbors in the village. He earns money to feed the cattle, take care of daily expenses, and of course to help his son.\r\n\r\nLike all farmers, Abdunaim works from morning to evening and cares for the animals afterwards. His colleague and friend advised him to buy another cow to increase his income, but he does not have enough cash in hand to buy one. Abdunaim decided to apply for a loan and hopes for financial support. He thanks Arvand in advance.

Together with her husband, she has raised five children. In 2008, the couple started a business of selling food products in a rented store. They used a sum of 10,000 som (KGS) in starting capital. After developing their business and acquiring returning customers, Darkangul has an average income of 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to their persistent work with the business, the couple was able to purchase livestock to breed, and currently Darkangul has two dairy cows, 20 sheep, one horse and two calves on her farm. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Darkangul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase food products and beverages wholesale to subsequently sell them as retail goods.

located in the beautiful state of Guerrero.  San Luis Acatl\u00e1n is famous for its warm people and its part of the Mixteca Nahua-Tlapaneca region.  \n\nMr. Adalberto is 66 years old.  He has lived in the small community of San Miguel all his life, and he has never left it.  He has two jobs - the first one he has had since his childhood as a farmer in farms of different ownerships.  The second one, and in his own words his favorite, is being a proud grandfather of his four grandchildren.  Mr. Adalberto lives with his four grandchildren and his daughter in a small household that lacks energy access.  In order to have light Mr. Adalberto has to walk two hours to the nearest town to buy candles, a task he has been doing since his childhood once a week.  \n\nHowever, some weeks ago Mr. Adalberto noticed something new at his work.  Almost all the owners of the farms he works for have installed solar home systems to light their hectares.  This made Mr. Adalberto realize that he could work harder and purchase one of those solar home systems for his household.

chlorine dispenser. Beatrice is a hard-working, well-respected 70-year old woman with 10 children. \n\nGivogi village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected well. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Beatrice and the 10 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nBeatrice has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Beatrice volunteered to be the promoter because because she loved the volunteer job description and she wants to help the community to disinfect its water.

Rose is a friendly, hardworking, reliable and trustworthy member of the community with 3 children. She lives with her family in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, iron roof.\n\nSawani village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a borehole. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Rose and the 20 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nRose has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Rose volunteered to be the promoter because she was chosen and is willing to serve the community to help prevent sickness. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Luka, Mary, Enita and Joash.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.

She lives in the community of \"El Mes\u00f3n\" in Malinaltepec, a highly marginalized area located in the state of Guerrero.  She is part of a strong community where she interacts with Nestor and Angela, both heads of families that live in \"El Mes\u00f3n.\"  Florencia, Nestor and Angela have known each other for years and they all share the complications of having a poor and deficient energy service.  \n\nFlorencia has a little rural shop, where she makes a regular income of $10 USD a day.  Whenever the formal grid service fails (which is very often), Florencia is unable to carry on with her sales and therefore she loses clients and money.  By purchasing a solar home system, Florencia will be able to open her little rural shop and continue to offer products to her customers.  This will increase her income and improve the standard of living for her 5 children.

They began harvesting fields of coffee that their parents left them and since then, this has become their income source.  They all share the challenges that peasants face in this area, like having no constant income and being dependent on the prices of coffee. Nevertheless, they all work very hard to make ends meet and support their families.  \n\nPascacio is a proud father of 4 children who live with him and his wife.  They usually purchase lighting sources such as firewood or \"ocote\" in the nearest town that is located two hours away on foot.  This is not only expensive but tiresome for the entire family.

She would like a loan in the amount of 4,500,000 SLL. Rugiatu has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy drinks. She hopes that this loan will help her to improve the business and increase profits. In the future, Rugiatu plans to expand the business to the sale of imported rice. She started business in a stall and now has a shop. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1478323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T01:50:08Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rugiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":758626.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439644592},{"amount":175,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-18T09:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":758626.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552094},{"amount":175,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":758626.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459018709},{"amount":175,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T08:55:49Z","rounded_local_amount":758626.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467830094},{"amount":175,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":758626.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479052506},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":252875.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490748615},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":505751.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504177587}],"funded_date":"2013-12-13T02:35:51Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:08:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":637903,"name":"Kadiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 30-year-old Kadiatu.

largest city in the country. Nine very energetic, entrepreneurial women joined together in one neighborhood and formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cLas Flores\u201d or \u201cThe Flowers\u201d. Their goal is not only to improve their own lives but also the lives of their families and their community. The group is about to begin its third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nLisethee, a 53 year old mother of four children, recently joined the group. Two of her four children are already in college and this motivates Lisethee to maintain and develop her small cafeteria, which is part of her home. Quite happily, the business is enjoying increasing success and she has hired two more people to assist her. Lisethee is currently applying for her first loan from Friendship Bridge which she will invest in the cafeteria, buying more cooking supplies as well as staples for food preparation and drinks.\r\n\r\nLisethee appreciates the microcredit and educational program offered by Friendship Bridge. She sees what a huge impact the program has on the lives of women because it allows them to gain the necessary tools to move forward in their lives. They are able to grow in so many ways and give their children opportunities like education, improved nutrition, better health that the women never had as children.

I began studying as a first year medical student at the Catholic and Technology university in Cibao (UCATECI), and I\u2019ve chosen this career because I feel that I will treat my patients with love when I become a doctor.  I need a loan because I don\u2019t have the money to pay the university and I have not been able to get a scholarship.  The loan is the option that I need to be able to become a professional.  Without it I will not be able to continue as a medical student.  I have goals of giving my all, working hard, pushing myself so that things will go well for me in my career, growing as a person over time, and helping my family in the future, especially my mother.  Once I complete my studies, I will look for work as a general practitioner and evaluate specialties.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1472140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Many of the eight women who form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cTikal\u201d create handmade textiles including ornate blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d, and other creations. Other women work in animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nTomasa is a 38-year-old widow and is the Secretary of the Trust Bank. The group is in its third loan cycle. She has been a widow for eight years and works diligently to take care of the basic needs of her five children. Tomasa raises animals including chickens and pigs. She is quite happy to receive a new loan which she will use to purchase 20 additional chickens and 2 pigs. She will also buy feed to fatten them. Her dream is to increase her business, creating more income so that she can continue to support her family. As many of the women in the Friendship Bridge program, Tomasa wants her children to complete their education, something that she was unable to do. At the present time, one child attends the 2nd grade, two are in 4th grade, and the last one is in 6th grade. Tomasa only reached the 4th grade.\r\n\r\nTomasa shares that she enjoys being a part of this Trust Bank. She feels empowered because she participates in making decisions and has learned many new things. Each month at the meetings of the \u201cTikal\u201d Trust Bank, the women receive trainings on subjects like money management, indebtedness, women\u2019s health and hygiene and medicinal plants. Armed with these new tools, Tomasa and her fellow Trust Bank members face a more prosperous and happier future for themselves, their families, and their community in the rural area of Chichicastenango.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":1478591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 20 additional chickens and 2 pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chichicastenango, Departamento El Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anastasia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3171},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3171},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3171},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3171},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3171},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3171},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3171},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3171},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3132}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":403.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":403.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":398.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":403.33,"local_amount":3171,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728427},{"amount":403.33,"local_amount":3171,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449634449},{"amount":403.33,"local_amount":3171,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459100944},{"amount":403.33,"local_amount":3171,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467915939},{"amount":403.32,"local_amount":3171,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479136747},{"amount":403.33,"local_amount":3171,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490830637},{"amount":403.33,"local_amount":3171,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256580},{"amount":403.33,"local_amount":3171,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540104},{"amount":398.37,"local_amount":3132,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3148.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530023351}],"funded_date":"2013-12-01T20:51:33Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:59:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Kuperberg","image":null}},{"id":636686,"name":"La Victoria Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado La Victoria est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 3.

The eldest son lives and works in the capital of Kyrgystan and helps the family financially, while the youngest son lives with the parents and helps with the farm. Begimjan has a high school degree and she raises livestock for a living. She started six years ago with 8,000 som KGS. Her diligent work expanded the herd and now Begimjan owns fifteen sheep. Begimjan re-sells the sheep at the local market after fattening them and makes 5,000 som KGS monthly profit this way. In order to further increase her herd Begimjan applied for a loan with micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" which she will use to buy more sheep. She plans to get more sheep with the profits from the loan and eventually plans to save enough money to purchase her son a car.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1478986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Zahro is a wonderful woman. She is an exemplary Tajik lady and a hardworking and caring mother of two children. Zahro is providing for her children by herself as her husband has passed away and she is a widow. It was hard for her to provide her kids with everything necessary, but due to her diligence and hard work she is able to raise them well. Her eldest son also helped his mother to provide for the family, but he has been drafted into the army now. Her second son is too young and still attends school. Zahro works as a saleswoman in a buffet-style restaurant. She diligently performs her duties. Her youngest son has needed a computer for a few years now, but Zahro's small salary made it impossible for her to purchase one. Now Zahro has requested a loan of 1500 somoni which she will use to buy the computer.

He is a father of eight children and a grandfather of many. All of his children are grown up and have their own families and kids. Kara's grandchildren attend school. Kara loves spending time with his grand children, but he also finds time for his work. Kara is an auto-mechanic. For more then 37 years he has been repairing cars. He loves his work and is not planning to retire any time soon. Kara would like to take out this loan to purchase spare auto-parts, among them a pump, three reduction drives, a piston, 10 gas cylinders and a few other parts. Since Kara doesn't have many saving of his own he needs to ask for a loan. Kara hopes that he will get help from Kiva because the world is never without kind and good

She has an unfinished college degree and is a professional accountant. Currently Natalia works at the farming co-op's office as a head secretary and her colleagues know her as a hardworking, honest and wise woman. To supplement her salary Natalia raises livestock. She started 22 years ago by purchasing cattle with 16,000 som (KGS). She worked hard to save money and expand her business and now owns two milk cows and two pregnant cows as well as 8.6 acres of land where she grows wheat, oats and feeder legume Onobrychis\/Lucerne.

They are grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making it possible for their business and personal life to flourish."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1477001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a roof at her husband's business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1662.32,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":126.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":128.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":134.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":134.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":141.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":144.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":146.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":153.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":156.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.84,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":110.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995303},{"amount":127.18,"local_amount":126.22,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":127.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450413747},{"amount":131.36,"local_amount":130.37,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":131.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102388},{"amount":135.83,"local_amount":134.8,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":135.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212279},{"amount":133.82,"local_amount":132.8,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":133.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138276},{"amount":138.73,"local_amount":137.68,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":138.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832285},{"amount":287.94,"local_amount":285.76,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":287.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258432},{"amount":146.35,"local_amount":145.24,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":146.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530546979},{"amount":152.27,"local_amount":151.12,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":152.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516137},{"amount":310.68,"local_amount":308.33,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":310.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649720}],"funded_date":"2013-12-15T20:24:53Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T12:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":637028,"name":"San Francisco Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"San Francisco es de la ciudad de Concepci\u00f3n, una zona un poco alejada de la zona c\u00e9ntrica y a\u00fan se encuentra en crecimiento.
