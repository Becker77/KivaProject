Her oldest, a daughter, is married and no longer lives with them; her middle child, a son, has followed in his parents' footsteps and works as a teacher at the university; and her youngest, a daughter, is still in school. Mairamkul has a higher education and works in the local school as a teacher of Russian language and literature. Her husband also works as a teacher in the local school. The family is well respected in the village. \r\n\r\nTo earn additional income for her family, Mairamkul raises animals, a business she started 26 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 3,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has three milk cows as well as 0.57 hectares of arable land on which she grows corn, with a monthly income of 15,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Mairamkul has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase sheep for fattening and resale in the marked for a higher price. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further augmentation of her herd, and to save toward the education of her youngest daughter at a prestigious university.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1480233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Violeta is 44 years old and went to school until third grade. She is married and has one daughter. Her husband works in a mill, and her daughter is in high school.\r\n\r\nVioleta says that when she left school, she accompanied her mother selling clothing in cities near where they lived. She says that from this experience she learned her mother\u2019s selling techniques. Last year, Violeta started a new business, which she says is completely different from what she knew before. This business is raising broiler chickens, which she learned how to do from a close family friend, who helped her with his knowledge of this area. Violeta says that she is very happy, because the business has gone very well for her, and that she is excited to continue with it. Violeta also says that this business has brought her family closer together, because her husband and daughter help her when they have free time.\r\n\r\nVioleta is requesting this loan to buy more chicks and nutritional supplements that are used in their food. She also plans to provide them all of the care they require, including improving the chicken coop where she keeps them for the six weeks it takes to raise them.\r\n\r\nVioleta\u2019s dreams include having her own clothing shop and seeing her daughter continue in school and advance academically. She also dreams of improving the infrastructure of her house, which she says needs maintenance to stop its deterioration."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1477145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy chicks and nutritional supplements that are used in their food, and to improve her chicken coop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T16:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T16:10:11Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violeta Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":37.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":39.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":44.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":49.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.47,"local_amount":36.47,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":36.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716523},{"amount":35.39,"local_amount":35.39,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:54:57Z","rounded_local_amount":35.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622176},{"amount":37.73,"local_amount":37.73,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":37.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088399},{"amount":39.8,"local_amount":39.8,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":39.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902653},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":41.13,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":41.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215866},{"amount":40.54,"local_amount":40.54,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:34:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817226},{"amount":268.94,"local_amount":268.94,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":268.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242700}],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T20:04:05Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:10:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":638185,"name":"Fozia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fozia is taking loan for her husband\u2019s tailoring business which he conducts at home.

She is in a relationship and her partner works as a public transport driver.

Later her mother started a business selling tortillas and Ana, as always, helped to make them. So this is how she came to learn the business and when she got together with her partner, he was unable to cover all of the household expenses and she decided to help out financially so she started her own business making tortillas. She works every day from 10 in the morning until 5 in the evening.\r\n\r\nAna needs to invest more in her tortilla business and do to this she needs to buy more supplies so she can increase her production and satisfy all of her customers' needs. With the loan she will be able to buy corn and firewood, which are her main raw materials for making the tortillas.\r\n\r\nAna dreams of having her own mill, since she has to walk about a kilometre to grind the corn and makes the dough from this. She also plans to start studying next year because she is finding it difficult not being able to read or write and of course she wants to help her children with their schooling so that they do not have the same difficulties that she has had to face over the last few

Her two oldest children work in the capital of Kyrgyzstan and help the family financially. Kalima has a high school education and her main goal is to expand her business and acquire more cattle. Kalima raises livestock to provide the family's main income. She began 17 years ago when she purchased cattle for 2,000 som (KGS). Kalima is driven and enterprising, working tirelessly for the good of her family. Thanks to her hard work, she now has one dairy cow, one bull, and 12 sheep. She earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. With the goal of expanding her business, Kalima asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy another cow. She plans to invest in more livestock with the profits and to save enough money to repair her

She and her husband are raising a son, their only child, who is in the 7th grade. Anarkan\u2019s husband has secondary education and earns a supplementary income by working as a seasonal construction worker. Anarkan has finished   technical college. In the past, she worked for many years as a dairy maid.  At present, as the main source of income for her family, Anarkan raises livestock. She launched this business 30 years ago by buying livestock for 500 KGS. Thanks to Anarkan\u2019s hard work, her farm now has five dairy cows and 1 ha [2.5 acres] of land, where she grows rice and clover every year.

She is currently the leader of the Las Trabajadoras de Chicua I (3) Group and she appears in the middle of the photo.  \r\n\r\nShe sells traditional clothing at her community's local market.  She decided on this business because it is viable, as the women from this region wear these garments, which is why they are in high demand.  Through her work she makes acceptable income that helps her contribute to her family's finances.  \r\n\r\nShe has now decided to form a group of women whose goal is to help their families financially.  That is why they are asking for a loan to buy traditional clothing, which will allow her to offer her customers better service and increase her profits.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to generate more income to invest in her business and improve her family's living conditions.

He is 31 years old.  He is a married young man.  He has four children.  Shamsuddin lives with his parents and wife.  They have a large family.  Shamsuddin is a serious and pleasant person.  He achieved a lot in life through his labor and effort.  After finishing school, his parents could not help him to get accepted to a university.  Shamsuddin really wanted to get accepted to the Academy and become a policeman.  He worked for the first years without getting into a university.  Because he is the only son in the family, he had to think about his mother and father first.  With his persistence and drive, he finally got accepted to the Academy.  Now Shamsuddin is studying on a contractual basis in the part-time division of the Academy of the Tajikistan Republic.  He also works for the police.  Once he finishes his studies, he will be able to get promoted at work.  Shamsuddin cannot currently pay for his studies because he has to provide for a large family alone.  He takes care of his parents and his family.  This is why he is awaiting support and help from You.  Shamsuddin is an active client of Humo.  Previously, he obtained a consumer loan to pay for education.  Having learned that Humo offers loans for education, he is happy to obtain his next

Her oldest daughter is married, second son is married and works in Russia, and helps the mother financially by sending a portion of his salary to her in Kyrgyzstan, and the youngest son lives with Zaripakhan.  He works at a flourmill.  Zaripakhan has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Zaripakhan is involved in animal husbandry, having started 22 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zaripakhan's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows and also a 0.73 hectare land plot, where she grows sunflowers and corn. The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS).

She and her husband are raising five children. Two daughters are married and live on their own. The two oldest sons are working in Russia, helping the family financially by sending their salaries home to Kyrgyzstan to support the family. Unfortunately this is not enough, so Bazarkhan farms and keeps livestock as the family's main source of income. She started this business 32 years ago when she bought livestock with 3,000 KGS. Because of Bazarkhan's hard work, her farm now boasts five dairy cows, one horse, and a 1 hectare plot of land where she grows peppers, corn, watermelons, a small apple orchard. This brings in a good income. Every year, Bazarkhan reaps a good crop of apples which she sells wholesale in the local market. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Bazarkhan approached microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy calves to fatten and resell for a profit. Bazarkhan plans to invest the profits she makes from the loan into further increasing her livestock, and she is saving enough money to send her youngest son to a prestigious university. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1480306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy calves to fatten and resell.

years old. She is married, and she and her husband, Samagan, are raising four children. Medina has a secondary education. Immediately after graduation, she married Samagan. Her husband is a taxi driver. He makes a small but consistent income. Medina is not idle. She is busy with household chores and children. Medina farms and keeps livestock to provide the family's main source of income. Medina started farming seventeen years ago when she bought 2,000 KGS worth of livestock. Thanks to Medina's hard work, her farm now boasts one bull, forty sheep, and three hectares of land where she grows beans and perennial herbs. Medina's husband helps her a great deal. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Medina approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cattle for breeding. Medina plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing her livestock and to save enough to renovate her house.

Her oldest daughter is married, second son is married and works in Russia, and helps the mother financially by sending a portion of his salary to her in Kyrgyzstan, and the youngest son lives with Tazagul.  He is unemployed.  Tazagul has a secondary education. She is very kind, responsive, hardworking and complaisant.  Any work gets done in her hands. To provide the primary income for her family, Tazagul is involved in animal husbandry, having started 29 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Tazagul's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 17 sheep and also a 1.0 hectare land plot, where she grows corn, and also has a small garden at home, where she grows tomatoes, peppers and pumpkins. She grows corn to provide her livestock with the feed.  The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Tazagul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls for fattening up and subsequent resale at a market at a high price. Tazagul has all of the right conditions at home to fatten up livestock. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to complete construction of her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1480197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves for fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kirova village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":103.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tazagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1023.07,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50164.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.93,"payment_id":529946992},{"amount":923.85,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50164.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.15,"payment_id":664995304}],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T07:38:52Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":638263,"name":"Alia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alia was born in 1979.

He was unable to continue school after 6th grade due to his parents' economic situation.  He is married and his wife takes care of their household.  Their children live with them and help Dimas with the farm, and there are two grandchildren in the family who are also his dependents.  \r\n\r\nDimas works in agriculture.  As he was born near where a lot of corn is grown, at the age of ten he took up agricultural work which he did with his father.  This is how he learned his occupation.  However, he also has three cows.  Dimas travels about 15 minutes on foot with his son every day between 7:00 AM and 11:00 AM to get to where his corn fields are.  \r\n\r\nDimas will use the loan to buy inputs (fertilizer, insecticide, and fungicide) for 7,000 square meters of corn as well as a calf to form a team with one he already has so he can work with them.  He hopes to have good harvests and a higher income to provide his family an adequate home and to pay off the loan. \r\n\r\nDimas's dreams and goals are, first, to have a good harvest, which is essential for his family, and to be able to educate his grandchildren.  The loan will be very helpful for Dimas because it will benefit his crops and increase his income, which will allow him to pay off the loan and, if he makes a profit, improve his very modest home.

She is a widow and has five children. She stopped school at an early age and got married. She was prompted to start running her own small business after the death of her husband six years ago. Her business deals in the sale of coca-cola products for wholesale and retail in her hometown of Livingstone, Zambia.\r\n\r\nThe business helps Mercy to pay for her children's school fees and take care of their basic needs. She starts her day at five o'clock in the morning and walks to the local breweries to get her orders. She then makes her way to her shop and makes sure her drinks are displayed very well so that customers can choose to buy from her as there are a lot of people doing the same business. Mercy says in the six years she has been running her business, her profit margins have remained more or less the same.  This is because she has not had the money to invest in her business so that she can order more drinks.\r\n\r\nA loan of 5,000 ZMW will help Mercy order more drinks for resale. This will improve her revenue and make it easier for her to provide for her children. She thanks the Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her five children go through college so that they can hopefully get good employment and take care of her in the

Specifically, she sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. Her customers' orders are purchased with cash by the dealer and then given to customers along with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in catalogs. Her regular customers are her neighbors and others in the local community. She typically earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 30,000 PHP. The loan proceeds would be used to buy additional supplies and merchandise, such as clothing, footwear, shampoo, cologne, deodorants, perfumes, soaps, fabric softeners, undergarments, and other products needed in her business. With help from the loan, Yonisa hopes that her business will expand because she dreams of providing her family with a better life. <p>\r\n\r\nEvery week she meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business. During their meetings, she also draws strength and inspiration from her co-members and from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

There were needs in her household, and she had to respond to them immediately.\r\n\r\nHer husband is an auto mechanic and works in a nearby shop.  Some days there are clients, and other days there is no work.  Their eldest son has already started grade school, and the younger one is in nursery school. \r\n\r\nJuan sells beauty products as well as jewelry.  She sells her goods on order through catalogs.  She works every day in neighboring areas and other places.  She has done this work for three years.  Previously, she sold food products in a shop.  She decided to start selling these particular products thanks to a friend who extended credit to her so that she could sell these goods and obtain a profit.\r\n\r\nShe needs a loan in order to stock her business with beauty products and jewelry, so she can take advantage of the Christmas shopping season, which is good for the commercial sector.

En esta actividad solo ellos 2 se involucran y se esfuerzan para no pagar mucho dinero en mano de obra ya que no cuentan con los recursos econ\u00f3micos para hacerlo. Linda espera obtener una excelente cosecha ya que de esto depende la econom\u00eda de su hogar, su producci\u00f3n la venden a los intermediarios que llegan a la localidad.\nPor lo que necesita financiamiento para la compra de abono, foliares, mano de obra y para poder asistir sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 y poder cumplir con sus metas de apoyar a sus hijos en sus estudios, fortaleces el patrimonio para ellos y que el d\u00eda de ma\u00f1ana tengan una tierra donde vivir y donde trabajar \n","en":"Linda, 39, works hard and is married. She finished elementary school. She has two young children, who are in elementary school. She lives with her two children, a niece, and her husband. For 10 years, Linda has been farming, specifically growing coffee, a trade she learned from her parents when she was a child, and she has a lot of experience. Her parents gave her some of her land, and, after much labor, she and her husband bought the rest. The land is 3 kilometers from her house, and she walks more than 10 minutes to reach it. Sometimes, it takes less time. Then they fertilize and weed the plants themselves. They work hard so that they don't have to spend much money on labor, as they don't have the resources to do so. \r\n\r\nLinda hopes to have an excellent harvest because her household finances depend on it. She sells her output to intermediaries who come to the area. She needs a loan to buy agricultural supplies and to pay laborers to help with her coffee plantings so that she can reach her goals of paying for her children's education, building assets for them, and having land on which they can live and work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1477301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies and to pay laborers to help with her coffee plantings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T22:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T22:10:04Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linda Claritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1425,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":29241,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490812960}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T21:20:46Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:28:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":637202,"name":"Brigido Hernan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Brigido es un se\u00f1or casado de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a sus 4 hijos de 2, 6, 8 y 11 a\u00f1os de edad, ambos aun se encuentran estudiando en el Departamento de Suchitepequez.\nEl actualmente tiene una tienda de abarrotes que se encuentra ubicado a unos metros de su vivienda.

As is common in many indigenous rural areas in Guatemala, the ladies have been weavers since childhood. They sell their textiles in their own community as well as in surrounding areas. One of the women sells cosmetics and another sells snacks.\n\nAgripina, a married 55-year-old woman, works in textile production, mostly crafting beautiful typical skirts called \u201ccortes.\u201d She delivers to her clients each week and has two full-time employees. At this time, Agripina is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase a variety of good quality threads and yarn. Since the year-end holidays are quickly approaching, Agripina wants to fill existing orders as well as additional incoming orders.\n\nOne of her three children is starting college next year and this is motivating her to work diligently before the year ends so that she can have enough extra funds to help him with educational fees. A common goal among the women in Friendship Bridge Trust Banks is to have enough money so that their children can attend school, an opportunity that many of them missed. Agripina shares, \u201cI could only study for three years, but I will encourage my children to reach college. I will do my best to help them because I know that it is so important. Because of my business and the income it provides, I think this is a real possibility.\u201d\n\nThe seven women of the Fatima Trust Bank greatly appreciate the opportunity to receive this new financial capital for their businesses. Empowered with their funds and a little education on subjects like business management, family health and self-esteem, they are poised to realize a better life benefiting themselves, their families, and their community!\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":1467222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Here, there was enough land for the Hmong to build a life and scrape by, although the lack of tourism or economic opportunity meant most families worked in toxic slash and burn agriculture and were trapped in a cycle of subsistence farming.\n\nBai grew up without an opportunity to earn an education, so her prospects were very limited. She speaks barely any Thai, so it is difficult for her to navigate transactions outside her community. When the opportunity to weave hammocks arose, Bai was very excited. She is able to work from home, make her own schedule and earn a far larger income doing work she enjoys. Bai is a skilled weaver and now that she knows that hammock weaving is a long-term opportunity, she is ready to stake her future on her abilities. This loan will help her family break the cycle of poverty and have a secure future, especially because her participation in Kiva comes in conjunction with financial training!\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1479963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to invest in raw materials so she can secure consistent weaving work and increase her income potential.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T23:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T23:50:12Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T16:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561836316}],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T01:50:12Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T16:15:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":639450,"name":"Pang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pang grew up as part of the first generation in the Huay Om settlement in the uplands of Phrae Province.

Nowadays, she can save about US$4 per day after the necessary expenses in her household. With VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), Ny is a fourth time borrower (including this new loan). The past loan, which she has paid back, has enabled her to stabilize her business and to improve her living in good pace. Now, she wants to focus on her daughter\u2019s education instead.

He lives with his wife, 16 year-old daughter, 6-year-old daughter, 14-year-old son, his brother, his brother\u2019s wife, and his mother. Hovik\u2019s wife and his brother\u2019s wife work in the village's local self governance body, and his brother works in the private sector. All of them work really hard, struggling to make a living. Hovik is extensively involved in agribusiness; he breeds livestock, such as cows and hens, and cultivates watermelons, alfalfa, and apricots, then sells the agricultural products in the local market. The agribusiness is an important source of the family\u2019s income. As life is getting more expensive with time, and the family\u2019s needs are increasing as well, Hovik needs to expand his agribusiness a little bit to be able to make ends meet.

She lives with her son, daughter-in-law, school age granddaughter (7 years old), and newborn granddaughter. Sirvard's son is a construction worker in the private sector and her daughter-in-law is an instructor at the village local kindergarten. To assist her family members to earn a living, Sirvard is engaged in breeding cows and pigs and cultivating alfalfa. All the family works hard to be able to meet the ends. Sirvard realizes the agricultural products in the local market, which is an important source of income for the family. As life is getting more expensive day by day, Sirvard wants to expand her agribusiness a little to more effectively meet the family's needs. A loan of USD 2,500 will help her greatly, enabling her to purchase three pigs and to make previous credit repayments. Sirvard and her family highly rely on the good will of the lenders and will appreciate their support in collecting the loan amount.

Artak is also engaged in cultivation of alfalfa, peach, apricot, cherries, and in viniculture. He sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is an important source of the family's income. As the family's needs are growing on a day-to-day basis, Artak needs to expand his agribusiness to be able to meet the needs. A loan of USD 3,000 will be a great support to this hard-working man and his family, enabling his to purchase two cows, to buy some forage for them, and to make previous credit repayments. With the help of the loan Artak will sustain his agribusiness. He and his family rely on the good will of the lenders and will be grateful to them for the support in collecting the needed loan.

She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Mariama says that the main challenge to her business is the price of transportation and insufficient finances to expand her business.\n\nMariama has requested a loan in order to buy more fish and cooking season for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support!\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1475373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish
