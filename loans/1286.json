She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\n\nUmu requires a loan in order to buy more bags and clothing material to expand her business.

He studied through the ninth grade. He is married, and his spouse dedicates herself to household tasks. They have a 4 year old daughter.\r\n\r\nCarlos works with his own truck, transporting people from town to a canton of the town. He has been doing this work for four years. Before that he worked out of the country. He bought the truck with that money and moved back to be with his family. His job is 15 minutes from his house.

She is married and the mother of four children. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Adoyia is one of the many Iraqi women who work from home using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\n\nShe has 10 years experience with her small, home-based sewing business, and as an experienced seamstress she is constantly looking for opportunities to improve the services she can provide to her customers and generate more income. Her work is interrupted frequently by power cuts in her area. To overcome this challenge and be able to manage her work and time better, she would like to buy a small generator and also a new sewing machine. To be able to afford these purchases she is participating in a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq (RI-Iraq). \n\nRI-Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor, thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

When Nasreen was not earning, her family was going through a big financial crisis that compelled her to use her stitching skills in a productive manner. Her husband was the sole breadwinner of the family, so Nasreen felt it obligatory to change her family\u2019s living standards and started working at home. Her hard work helped her establish a good clientele, but she is having difficulty in fulfilling large orders, so contacted the Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of PKR 20,000.

good-natured and cheerful man, 48 years old. He is married and has four children. Kenja's sons are working in Russia doing construction and earning a good income. Every month they send some money to their parents. Kenja lives with his wife in a small house in a rural village. In order to feed his family, he also runs his own business. Kenja works on a collective farm and keeps livestock. He has some land. Some of his land is irrigated, but not all. Here, Kenja grows carrots, potatoes and grains. His wife helps him take care of and raise cattle. Since their plot of land is large, they also graze their cattle on it. The livestock business brings in a good income, so Kenja wants to expand the business by increasing his cattle herd. For this he turned to the Arvand to get a loan to buy cattle. Kenja thanks Arvand in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1480857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T06:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T06:10:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenja","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":234.65},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":240.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":246.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":252.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":258.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":266.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.49},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":266.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":234.65,"local_amount":234.65,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":234.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302786},{"amount":240.49,"local_amount":240.49,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":240.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585587},{"amount":246.48,"local_amount":246.48,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":246.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081168},{"amount":252.62,"local_amount":252.62,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":252.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562046},{"amount":258.91,"local_amount":258.91,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":258.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694735},{"amount":266.85,"local_amount":266.85,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":266.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626540}],"funded_date":"2014-01-27T01:47:35Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":636893,"name":"Trust's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These members are part of a group called Trust, which is made up of three people who live in the same neighborhood.

He is married with a child and has worked as a taxi driver for three years already. Despite his young age, Harut perfectly manages to cover his family's needs with the income he gathers from driving a taxi.\r\n\r\nCurrently, because of his family's difficult financial position, Harut wasn't able to save money for renovation of the car.

They don\u2019t consider the competition a problem since the market is fixed.  For these reasons, today Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n has asked for a loan to buy agricultural supplies like fertilizers of various kinds and insecticides which will allow her to maintain her coffee crop.  She dreams of supporting her children through school, seeing them graduate from college, and providing them with a better quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1477573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T07:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T07:30:03Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1425,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:05:01Z","rounded_local_amount":29241,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504237064}],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T15:32:02Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:05:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kimberly Scott","image":null}},{"id":638552,"name":"Phanice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phanice is a 24-year-old farmer living in the Kitale area of the North Rift area of Kenya.

The loan will be used to stock more essential items and foodstuffs, and will help Florence to generate greater profits and help in paying school fees for her children. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to acquire more profits from the business. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Florence who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1479393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock more essential items and foodstuffs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kachwamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":141027},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":146121},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151398},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":156866},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":162531},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":168401},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":174483},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":180784},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":187313},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":194078},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200886}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.44,"local_amount":136112,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":138126.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449600930},{"amount":114.86,"local_amount":287148,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-21T08:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":291397.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459865981},{"amount":60.56,"local_amount":151398,"processed_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":153638.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467879234},{"amount":62.75,"local_amount":156866,"processed_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":159187.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479102539},{"amount":65.01,"local_amount":162531,"processed_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":164936.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490797237},{"amount":67.36,"local_amount":168401,"processed_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":170893.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504219549},{"amount":236.47,"local_amount":591183,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-24T09:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":599932.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519783072},{"amount":58.2,"local_amount":145475,"processed_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":147628.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561613446},{"amount":80.35,"local_amount":200886,"processed_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":203859.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579523509}],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T18:15:34Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:15:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":638597,"name":"Januka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Januka is 40 years old.

He also does agriculture on a small scale and he is hopeful that the profits from the two businesses will help him cater for the needs of his family adequately. He started the business because the other people who were trading in cattle were doing well and they had model families with their children in better schools so he was optimistic that his family would also be a model family in the village. He would like to use the money to buy more cattle for trade with high hopes that the business will be profitable and his children will have the best education ever.

His clients are businessmen and farmers in the same area where he does the business and he says that his honesty has helped him to maintain his good customers. \r\n\r\nJustus's challenge is inadequate time since he spends less time at the farm as he is employed in a tea factory as a field supervisor where he gets additional income to sustain his family.

In this manner, she will help with expenses a little more because they are increasing with the arrival of another child.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that with this new income she will improve her quality of life, because she will have more income and therefore give her children what she didn\u2019t have. When she was young, she remarks that they were too poor: in total they were 7 siblings.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to continue working really hard to reach her proposed objectives: give her children the chance to study, so that they can confront life differently. She also has another dream which is to improve her humble home and she asks God for the life and strength to do it."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1478446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a female pig and improving the pig pen.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leydi Yasenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517527041}],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T21:08:34Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Martin","image":1188596}},{"id":637852,"name":"Carla Ibeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Carla de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con sus dos hijos, se dedica a prestar sus servicios como cocinera en la rosticer\u00eda \"Victoria\", donde ya trabaja desde hace dos a\u00f1os, se caracteriza por ser una persona responsable y tiene muchas ganas de superarse, ahora solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar muebles para su hogar con el fin de darle mayor comodidad a sus hijos y proporcionarles un mejor nivel de vida.","en":"Carla is 32 years old, she lives with her two sons and works as a cook in a restaurant (\u201cRotisserie Victoria\u201d), where she has been working during the last 2 years.

The small, income-generating activity based in her home allows her to be flexible with the household duties as well as with the orders received from her clients. \r\n\r\nA major obstacle, however, is the fact that her area experiences frequent power cuts that can last for many hours, with no regular patterns or predictability. This makes planning her work difficult and also leaves her little time for the orders to be completed. To be able to better plan the work and deliver better quality services, she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to afford the purchases, she is taking a group loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients who are unable to provide a guarantor and are thereby unable to apply for loans as  individuals. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients, and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.\r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for her protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support of Iraqi borrowers."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1479385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T17:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T17:30:08Z","loan_amount":6000,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatema ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taeh ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flayh ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joy Adams","image":1247614}},{"id":637899,"name":"Jerusalem Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco de emprendimiento JERUSALEM, est\u00e1 compuesto por ocho integrantes siete mujeres y un  var\u00f3n,  todas ellas se dedican a distintas actividades, la presidenta del banco es la se\u00f1ora Martha, tiene 27 a\u00f1os tiene un hijo de dos a\u00f1os, ella se dedica a la confecci\u00f3n de prendas de vestir,   vive en la zona de  Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas donde es su taller, este pr\u00e9stamo este pr\u00e9stamo es la primera secuencia dentro de la instituci\u00f3n va a usar este pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de tela al por mayor  su raz\u00f3n para solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo es que tienen  pedidos de sus clientes, la se\u00f1ora Martha enfrenta retos en su negocio que son la falta de capital,  y va a utilizar los beneficios en el crecimiento del negocio su deseo  para  su negocio es tener mayores ingresos y apoyar a la familia econ\u00f3micamente y as\u00ed mejorar su calidad de vida.\t","en":"The Jerusalem bank of entrepreneurship is made of eight members, seven women and one man.

He lives in Punata, a province located 45km from Cercado, the capital of Cochabamba. From a small child, his dream was to help teach people things that could improve their life, and this was why he decided to study dentistry, in order to avoid dental illnesses.<br \/><br \/>He is the youngest of five brothers. Their father lived for many years in Argentina working as a construction worker so he could save money for his family, who stayed behind in Bolivia.<br \/><br \/>Juan Carlos got married early,  to his high-school sweetheart. He has two children aged 8 and 2. As his parents are already getting on in years, he lives with them to look after them and to contribute to the household bills.<br \/><br \/>Although it cost him many sacrifices to become a professional, he was able to complete his course and return to work in Punata hospital so he could fulfil his dream of helping people. However, his income barely covers the costs of supporting his family and his parents.<br \/><br \/>For this reason, he is asking for an educational loan, so that he can access a specialist orthodontics programme, thus providing a better service to his patients, and ultimately achieving his dream of helping people have a better life.

Because of her husband's difficult personality, she divorced him and raised their three children alone. Her husband did not have anything to do with parenting the children, nor did he pay any support. After divorcing her husband and getting through depression, Buzeinep pulled herself together and vowed that she will be able to get on her feet and give her children everything they need in life. Buzeinep has a higher education. She works as a medical assistant in the district hospital, and to make additional income, Buzeinep works with livestock. She started thirteen years ago by buying 15,000 KGS worth of livestock. She is doing well, thanks to her hard work and persistent nature. Buzeinep's farm today boasts three milk cows and five sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, she approached the microfinance bank Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy sheep for fattening and resale. Buzeinep plans to use profits from the loan to increase her domestic animals and save enough money to repair her house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1480891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She and her husband are raising seven children. Toktobubu is a very happy person because of her seven children. All of the children grew up to be clever and obedient. Half of them are married and live on their own. The others help Toktobubu on the farm. The whole family is hardworking, and Toktobubu instilled a love of hard work in them during childhood. Toktobubu's husband is a farmer. Toktobubu has a secondary education. The family's primary source of income is animal husbandry. Toktobubu started this business 26 years ago when she bought 1,000 KGS worth of livestock. Through Toktobubu's hard work, her farm now boasts three dairy cows, ten horses, and 23 sheep. Toktobubu has everything needed for keeping livestock at home. With Toktobubu's guidance, they have procured about 1,000 bales of hay for the winter. Her monthly income is 17,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Toktobubu  approached the microfinance bank Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding. She plans to use profits she makes from the loan to invest in further increasing her domestic animals, and she plans to save enough money to purchase a family car. Toktobubu's dream is to take the whole family to the sea in their family car. She has the whole family working toward this.

He is in a common-law marriage and his partner is a homemaker. They have one two-year-old son in common.\r\n\r\nWilber works in agriculture, planting corn, beans and sorghum. He has been doing this work since he was very young. His father taught him to farm. He decided to do this kind of work because he couldn't find another way to help his family. In addition to agriculture, he also works as a driver. He does not have his own car, but when sought out to do trips he has done this type of work to generate a little more household income. To get to where he grows, he travels 3 kilometers by bicycle, occasionally on foot, or when necessary in an ox-drawn wagon. His work schedule is seven hours per day.\r\n\r\nWilber will invest a portion of the loan in the purchase of two oxen to transfer agricultural product to the house. A smaller portion he will invest in home improvement. He will swap out doors and pour a cement floor inside his house to ensure that his family is in the best conditions.\r\n   \r\nHis dream is to find a steady job that allows him the opportunity to better support his family and give them a decent life. The loan will help him have a work tool.

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Manar is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family. She learned to sew at a young age and by now has 10 years of experience with making dresses for women and children and also making small fabric household items based on her customers\u2019 needs. The small, income generating activity based in her home allows her to be flexible with the household duties as well as with the orders received from the clients. \r\n\r\nA major obstacle, however, is the fact that in her area power cuts are frequent and can last for many hours, with no regular patterns or predictability. This makes planning the work difficult, and also leaves her little time for the actual orders to be completed. To be able to better plan the work and deliver better quality services she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to afford the purchases she is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.\r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

She and her husband have four children. Her sons are now in Russia as migrant workers, and the youngest daughter attends secondary school. Darikhan has received secondary education. She works as a janitor at the village administrative office. As an additional source of income for her family, Darikhan raises livestock and gardens. She started this business 20 years ago by buying livestock for 3,000 KGS. Her husband helps her out on the farm. Thanks to Darikhan's hard work, her farm now includes eight sheep and an apple orchard producing a good harvest. Her monthly income is 2,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Darikhan has turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance  institution for a loan to increase her livestock by buying a cow. Darikhan plans to invest the resulting income into a further headcount increase, and plans to grow her savings so as to achieve financial stability.

children.  Her husband died young and her children were left without their father and the main family breadwinner.  It was very hard for Nazgul to survive his death, but she finally got a hold of herself and found some work so she could feed her family.  She works in a bakery as a part-time packer on a rotational basis, but unfortunately her salary is not enough to support her family and as a source of additional income she decided to raise animals.  She started doing this 15 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 3,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, she now has two cows, ten sheep and she also has a 2.25 hectare plot of land on which she grows wheat and legumes.  Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of developing her business further, Nazgul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy bulls to fatten up and sell for a profit at the local market.  Nazgul is a very enterprising and industrious woman and she believes that she can do well for her family.  She plans to use the income from the loan to further increase her head of livestock and she also intends to raise money to improve her financial situation and to build a good future for her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1480845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":123.01,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":85000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":411.76,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20152.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053487},{"amount":404.43,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":20152.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.34,"payment_id":542440335},{"amount":185.05,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10076.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.83,"payment_id":595435897},{"amount":347.41,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20152.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":64.36,"payment_id":636160973},{"amount":278.34,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":15114.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.48,"payment_id":664995305}],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T08:15:41Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":638889,"name":"Salome","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salome is 42 years old and runs a retail shop in Kangundo town.

His major clients are local residents of the area and those from nearby villages that come to Rukungiri to shop.  He wants a loan which he will use to buy more shoes to add to his stock.

He is married and has two children who are both currently in school. For the past year, Robert has been working hard to manage his pharmacy which sells medications. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Robert has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more medications for sale. This will help Robert to generate greater profits and take care of his family's basic needs. He hopes that in the future he will be able to increase his inventory. \r\n\r\nRobert is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Robert who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1480053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy more medications for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kasese","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":170102},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":176247},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":182613},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":189210},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":196044},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":203126},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":210463},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":218066},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":225943},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":234104},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":242560},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":251522}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.04,"local_amount":170102,"processed_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T09:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":172619.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440156327},{"amount":143.54,"local_amount":358860,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-21T08:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":364171.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459865984},{"amount":75.69,"local_amount":189210,"processed_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":192010.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467879237},{"amount":78.42,"local_amount":196044,"processed_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":198945.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479102542},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":203126,"processed_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":206132.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490797240},{"amount":84.18,"local_amount":210463,"processed_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":213577.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504219552},{"amount":87.23,"local_amount":218066,"processed_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-24T09:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":221293.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519783075},{"amount":90.38,"local_amount":225943,"processed_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":229286.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529988642},{"amount":93.64,"local_amount":234104,"processed_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":237568.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542480170},{"amount":97.02,"local_amount":242560,"processed_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":246149.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561613449},{"amount":100.61,"local_amount":251522,"processed_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":255244.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579523512}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T11:46:40Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:16:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null}]}
