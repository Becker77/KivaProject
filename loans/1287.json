However, he cannot fully meet his family's needs based on his salary alone. \r\n\r\nHayk is engaged in breeding a livestock of pigs, in viniculture, and in the cultivation of barley, peaches, apricots, plums and pears. He sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is a very important source of income for the family.

In composition, his family includes his retired parents, wife and children. His wife works on a collective farm. Kholnazar is engaged in agriculture, growing vegetables and cucumbers. <br \/><br \/>Winter is coming and Kholnazar is in a hurry to plant potatoes and wheat, so in the spring he will have a crop. For this, he is asking for a loan because his resources are not enough to buy mineral fertilizers and wheat. It is not too late to realize the planting, because winter in Tajikistan comes later than in other countries. But Kholnazar is not relaxing and quickly wants to plant a crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1480946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wheat and mineral fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qubadiyon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kholnazar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":213.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":219.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":225.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":232},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":238.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":245.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":252.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":259.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":274.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":282.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":290}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":216,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":223.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449683274},{"amount":46.91,"local_amount":216.5,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":223.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459152990},{"amount":48.86,"local_amount":225.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":233.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467969163},{"amount":50.26,"local_amount":232,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":239.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479189455},{"amount":51.7,"local_amount":238.6,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":246.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490882847},{"amount":53.17,"local_amount":245.4,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":253.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504309887},{"amount":54.69,"local_amount":252.4,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":261.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517591689},{"amount":297.61,"local_amount":1373.6,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1420.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530087345}],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T20:11:15Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:33:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":638988,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia is thankful for the financial assistance extended to her.

Approximately 6 years ago, she began her own beauty salon with which she has generated income to sustain the basic needs of the household and to provide education to her children. She came to learn this trade thanks to her mother, who has a beauty salon located in a city on the Caribbean coast. Her first job she had as an independent was with hair straighteners, as an in-home service; but due to family difficulties she had to stop this work, as she didn't have anyone with whom to leave the children to care for them while she worked. For this reason she decided to start a beauty salon in her home. There she provides services and generates economic resources, while caring for her children. Today she needs a loan to invest in the purchase of fixed assets (tables, mirrors, hair dressing chairs, washing stations, etc.). In this way she will be able to improve working conditions and also be able to provide better convenience to her customers, which will increase her income from the services that increase in the Christmas season. Ana wants to continue her trade and making a business that will be prosperous and competitive, so that she can generate reliable and stable income for her family that will give her the opportunity to enjoy a better quality of life and well being at the side of those that she loves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1478672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She works six days in a week, and her business is located in a cell in Ishaka town, where she has been since 2010. Her clients are mainly the families in Ishaka town.\r\n\r\nShe believes that if she gets a loan of 1,000,000 shillings, her business will expand and she will get enough money to pay tuition for her children. She would like to buy more stock using the loan money so that she makes more profits, which will in the long run help her to pay school fees and see all her children through school. Her major challenge is rainy weather, but she is hopeful that it will be over with

She is married and has seven children, with three of them currently in school. \r\n\r\nFor the past 15 years, Jovans has been working hard to manage her farming business:  She rears goats. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jovans has requested a loan of UGX 3,000,000 from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more goats.  It will help Jovans to generate greater profits and improve on the stock of her business by buying more goats and also taking care of her medical bills. \r\n\r\nJovans hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another business. \r\n\r\nJovans is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Jovans who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

He completed high school in 1998 and obtained a diploma in teaching. He resigned as a teacher because the income was not enough to sustain him and his family.\r\n\r\nHe operates a grocery store and sells Coca-Cola products to customers in his hometown of Zimba. Adrian has been running his business for 11 years now. The income from this business is very important to him and his family, as it helps cover basic needs. \r\n\r\nHe enjoys running his business because it gives him the opportunity to interact with other business owners in his hometown and earn a decent living.\r\n\r\nAdrian has applied for a Kiva loan to add to his drink stock.

Por razones de la vida viajo buscando un mejor futuro para su esposa y estando fuera del pa\u00eds, decidieron separarse, desde entonces vive solo con sus hermanos en la misma casa.  Se dedica a los trabajos de la agricultura y trabajos jornales de donde tiene sus ingresos para sus gastos personales y ayudar a sus hermanos en los gastos de la vivienda, que es donde solo hace un aporte; porque solo fuera pasa trabajando y esa es toda su familia que \u00e9l tiene, porque nunca pudo formar su propio hogar.\n\nJuan se dedica a la agricultura, desde que ten\u00eda la edad de 10 a\u00f1os, inicio trabajando como corralero en las haciendas que exist\u00edan antes andaba con ganado y realizaba trabajos en los cultivos de ma\u00edz en todo lo de la agricultura. Toda la vida esa ha sido la actividad, a la cual sea dedicado y gracias a eso tiene mucha experiencia en lo de ma\u00edz y frijol que son los cultivos que produce; todo esto lo aprendi\u00f3 de una manera obligado porque sus padres siempre les obligaban al trabajo no los dejaban asistir a la escuela como hoy manifiesta el cliente. A parte de la agricultura, se dedica a  hacer trabajos de jornal y tambi\u00e9n en la producci\u00f3n de ma\u00edz trabajan en conjunto con su otro hermano y la distancia que recorren para llegar al campo es de 45 minutos en bicicleta, que dice venir rendido cuando llega a casa, porque su trabajo lo realiza todo el d\u00eda de 6 a 5 de la tarde.\n\nEl dinero lo solicito para realizar, los pagos de mosos que pondr\u00e1 a cosechar 21,000 metros cuadrados de ma\u00edz y esto porque quiere salir con los primeros granos en el mes de enero donde a\u00fan se mantiene a un buen precio.

For reasons of life, he traveled to look for a better future for his wife, and since he was out of the country, they decided to separate. Since then, he lives unaccompanied, in the same house as his siblings. He works in agriculture and also as a day laborer, from which he has income for his personal expenses and to help his siblings with the household expenses, which is his main contribution, because he spends all his time working. This is all the family that he has, because he was never able to have his own family.\n\nJuan has worked in agriculture since the age of 10. He began working as a ranch hand on the ranches that existed in the past. He worked with cattle and did work in the corn fields in everything related to agriculture. His whole life has been this work, and thanks to this he has a lot of experience with corn and beans, which are the crops he produces. He was obliged to learn all this because his parents always required them to work. They did not let them go to school, as he states now. In addition to agriculture, he works as a day laborer and also in the production of corn. He works together with his other brother and the distance that they travel to arrive at the field is about 45 minutes by bicycle, which is to say that he is worn out when he arrives at the house, because he does his work all day from 6 [in the morning] until 5 in the afternoon.\n\nHe is applying for the loan to pay the workers who will harvest 21,000 square meters of corn, because he wants to appear with the first grains in the month of January when the price is still good. With the money, he will be able to cover the need to harvest his grain much more rapidly and easily and with less work for him and his brother.\n\nHe thinks that with the earnings from his production, he will be able to help his nephew, since he is like the son that he was never able to have. With tears in his eyes, the borrower greatly laments that he was never able to have his own family and have the support of his wife, although his siblings help him, but it's not the same. But he has faith in God that his condition in life will improve and he will be able to live in a way that requires less work.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1477595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

In line with cultural and traditional practices, as a yet-unmarried man he is living with his family.  \r\n\r\nTo generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of his family, he is working hard as a vegetable and fruit salesman. He started his little shop two years ago.\r\n\r\nA typical way to sell fruits and vegetables in his area is by driving around in the neighborhood, selling his goods on the street, near the homes of his customers. Every morning the streets of neighborhoods are noisy from the horns of such moving stalls, as women shop for the daily fresh goods for that day\u2019s lunch and dinner. \r\n\r\nRasol would like to buy a small vehicle, a 3-wheeled motorcycle with a platform on the back, typical for delivering and selling vegetables so he can participate in this mode of selling and increase his sales by going into the areas where customers are ready to buy. \r\n\r\nTo be able to make the purchase he is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients, and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.\r\n\r\nAs all the members of this group are under the age of 30 - with ages 25, 28, and 18 - the group qualifies for a \"youth loan.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":1480088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth"],"use":"to buy a small vehicle to transport his goods to his customers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T04:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T04:10:06Z","loan_amount":6000,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rasol ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hussain ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdulla ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841690},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449731574},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459210951},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-19T09:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468635380},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479254190},{"amount":3000,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-18T11:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561782396}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T03:29:31Z","paid_date":"2014-11-18T11:00:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":639053,"name":"Jabeen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jabeen is 31 years old, a married woman and the mother of five children.

member of this group is a 23 years old Iraqi woman. She is married and a mother of one child. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, she is one of many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income to help support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has five years of experience making dresses for women and children and also making small household fabric items, based on her customers\u2019 needs. Her small, income generating activity, based in her home, allows her to be flexible with the household duties as well as with the orders received from clients. \r\n\r\nA major obstacle, however, is that her electrical power is not reliable, frequently cutting off for hours with no regular pattern or predictability.  This makes planning her work difficult, and also leaves her little time to compete her actual work orders. To better plan the work and deliver higher quality services, she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine.  To be able to afford the purchases, she is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

She is a young married Iraqi woman. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Fatma is one of the many Iraqi women who are working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.<br \/><br \/>Despite her young age, she has many years of experience making dresses for women and children and also making small household items out of fabric based on her customers\u2019 needs. The small, income generating activity based in her home allows her to be flexible with her household duties as well as with the orders received from her clients. A major obstacle, however, is the fact that in her area power outages are frequent and can last for many hours, with no regular patterns or predictability. This makes planning the work difficult, and also leaves her little time for the actual orders to be completed. To be able to better plan the work and deliver better quality services she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to afford the purchases she is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. <br \/><br \/>Relief International Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.<br \/><br \/>Based on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi

In his family, only Rustamkhon and two of his elder sons are earning an income. For over 10 years, Rustamhkon has been providing a service renting out tables, chairs and plates. He makes it possible for residents of the Khamadoni region to rent tables, chair, plates for weddings and other events. Rustam has been working out of a small leased space for several years. Since he is a goal-oriented person by nature, he has decided to expand his business. His main goal is to own his proper store. He does not want to continue leasing space as this requires a lot of money. Rustamkhon lacks own funds in order to realize this plan, which is why he is applying for a loan. Rustamkhon would like to purchase a spacious store and use it to provide his services. He has already picked a suitable property; he just needs to make a payment and prepare the documents for the property transfer. Rustamkhon truly needs this loan.

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Neda is one of the many Iraqi women who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and to participate in meeting the financial needs of her family. She has over 10 years of experience with making dresses for women and children and also making small fabric household items based on her customers\u2019 needs. The small, income-generating activity based in her home allows her to be flexible with the household duties, as well as with the orders received from the clients. A major obstacle, however, is the fact that in her area power outages are frequent and can last for many hours, with no regular patterns or predictability. These outages make planning the work difficult and also leave her little time for the actual orders to be completed. To be able to better plan the work and to deliver better quality services, she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to afford the purchases, she is taking a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. \r\n\r\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq offers \u201cgroup loans\u201d for clients who are unable to provide a guarantor and, therefore, unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients, and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.\r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. Relief International Microfinance Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders\u2019 consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1480094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T05:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T05:30:06Z","loan_amount":6000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neda ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thamir ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salih ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Youngberg","image":null}},{"id":634787,"name":"Teddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teddy is 48 years old and lives in the town of Kalisizo in the region of Masaka in Uganda.

He left Tajikistan in order to improve the living conditions of his family. Muzafar's other children (two sons and a daughter) live with him. \r\n\r\nFor around two years, Muzafar has been in the business of crop farming. It is his only job and, currently, his only source of income for his family. \r\n\r\nIn Tajikistan, winter comes later than in other countries. This is why Muzafar still has a chance to sow wheat on his plot of land. The reason why he is starting to sow his seeds so late is that he did not have enough money. Muzafar decided to take out a loan to buy mineral fertilizers, tractor fuel and wheat grains in order to more quickly finish sowing his seeds. If he does not finish doing this on time then he won't have a harvest in the Spring. Muzafar needs assistance.

The group's representative is named Mary. She is a married woman who has been selling pineapple for five years. Mary works from as early as 8:00 AM until 5:00 PM every day. With the profits that she makes from her business, she is able to help cover the daily expenses of the family and save. \r\n\r\nMary is a member of one of the local branches of ID-Ghana and she is requesting a loan to buy more pineapple and pawpaw to resell to customers. Through this loan, she is hoping to see an increase in her profits. She would also like to contribute to the improvement of her family's nutrition. Her goal is to save some money, and to take care of her children.

He is a young father of two children. He has a son and a daughter. Fayzali has a happy marriage. He married his beloved girlfriend. His wife is a homemaker who looks after their children while Fayzali works in the fields. Fayzali practices crop farming. He grows wheat on his plot of land. Now it is time for the winter sowing of the wheat. Fayzali is planning to buy fuel for his tractor and wheat seeds.

He was taught the trade by his mother, who has flowers that she sells across the country.  Mauricio's flowers are grown on lots of land that he owns and he works there from Monday to Friday.  Mauricio has the support of an employee who works at the weekend, while he drives a taxi in order to boost his monthly income.  Mauricio is known for his drive, the care he gives his work, and his dedication.  He has overcome various difficulties that have arisen due to his lack of experience but he has managed to get ahead with his crops.  Mauricio is now applying for a loan to invest in fixed assets (stationary machinery and a plastic sheet) and farming supplies (manure, pesticides, fungicides, and more) in bulk.  This will allow Mauricio to continue with his work in a more organised fashion, and he will be able to better protect his crops from the sun and the various insects that pose a risk to his crops.  The result of this will be an excellent harvest of flowers that can be sold at a better price and which will generate higher profits. Mauricio wants to continue with his work, further strengthen his business and, in the future, be able to achieve his dream of having to flowers to export.  He thinks that this will be a great source of income which, in the long run, will mean a higher quality of life for him and his

He began this several years ago, having found it difficult to find work in a business due to his age.  This motivated him to look for new options which would allow him to make progress and attend to the well-being of his family, consisting of his wife and 6 children.  He works alone, seven days a week from 7am to 10pm and, never having been educated or received training in how to manage a business of this type, he learned the ropes by trial and error.  He has gradually stabilised his business and become well known in the local area.  He is currently applying for the loan to buy stock (grains, fizzy drinks, beer, dairy products, sweets, snacks, biscuits, etc.) in bulk, which will mean that he has enough to satisfy demand which is rising now that Christmas is approaching and his sales and income tend to increase.  In this way, Heriberto wants to keep striving to achieve financial stabilityand well-being for his family, his ambition being to provide them with a better quality of life for as long as God and his

She has worked for 14 years as a street vendor of coffee, spices, and fried food that she herself made.  She sold the products on a corner near a hospital, a school, and a church.  This way she generated the income to support the basic needs of her household.\r\n\r\nA short time later she acquired a loan and advice for improving the profitability of her business.  This motivated her to turn her small working place into a well-established kiosk where she continues selling her products.  She started to introduce new dishes because she got a fast food cart.\r\n\r\nCurrently Mery's requesting the support of a second loan cycle to buy supplies wholesale (pastry, soda, prepared fried foods, coffee, spices, and so forth).  This will allow her to stock up enough to satisfy demand, which increases at the end of the year.  The result will be a considerable improvement in the sales and profits she earns from her job.\r\n\r\nMery dreams of strengthening and keeping up her business over time because she has managed to get her family ahead with it.  She wants to continue doing this as long as God and her body allow so in the future she can enjoy more peaceful senior years in the company of those she loves.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1478846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T12:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T12:50:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43634},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44839},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46078},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47350},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48658},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50002},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51383},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52802},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54260},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55759},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57299},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58881},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60507},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62179},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63896},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65660},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67474},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69339}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.72},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":91335,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":92504.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010066},{"amount":22.69,"local_amount":43216,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":43769.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523718},{"amount":89.81,"local_amount":171063,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":173254.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227398},{"amount":364.55,"local_amount":694386,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":703280.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245041}],"funded_date":"2013-12-02T01:04:50Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:58:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":639101,"name":"Merlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlinda is a married woman and a mother of three young children.

She's confident that with more chickens her sales will increase, because often demand is greater than what she has.\r\n\r\nThis is why Lilian's requesting this loan from FUSAI to buy chickens to fatten, concentrated feed, and vitamins.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1478663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy chickens, concentrated feed, and vitamins","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":29.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":30.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":32.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":36.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":37.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.23,"local_amount":29.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":29.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":441330353},{"amount":30.18,"local_amount":30.18,"processed_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":30.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450362495},{"amount":31.16,"local_amount":31.16,"processed_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":31.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459011664},{"amount":32.17,"local_amount":32.17,"processed_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":32.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467822426},{"amount":33.22,"local_amount":33.22,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":33.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479370227},{"amount":34.3,"local_amount":34.3,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-19T08:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":34.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491253028},{"amount":109.74,"local_amount":109.74,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T08:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":109.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519528252}],"funded_date":"2013-12-06T18:21:36Z","paid_date":"2014-08-23T08:58:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":638150,"name":"Mar\u00eda Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, inici\u00f3 con su actividad de confecci\u00f3n hace varios a\u00f1os, idea que surgi\u00f3 de la necesidad y la crisis econ\u00f3mica por la que pasaba su familia; ya con la experiencia que hab\u00eda obtenido mientras trabajaba en diferentes talleres de confecci\u00f3n, decidi\u00f3 emprender su propio taller, trabajando con una m\u00e1quina de coser sencilla y confeccionando sobre moldes, pero cuando requer\u00eda hacer recubrimientos o fileteado deb\u00eda alquilar una m\u00e1quina por horas o esperar a que se la prestaran.

So, using the experience she had acquired working in other clothing factories, she decided to set up her own workshop, using a simple sewing machine and patterns.  However, when she wanted to make linings or do overlocking she had to hire a machine for a number of hours or wait until someone could lend her one.  Then, when she received business guidance on how to make her workshop more versatile so that she could make clothing to measure rather than by using patterns, she was motivated to seek the loan.  She would like to use it to replace her old sewing machine with an industrial flatbed one, which will enable her to streamline the production process and make her more efficient and competitive.  All this is because of her indomitable spirit and perseverance which drive her on in pursuit of her ambitions.  Her income from her business goes to contribute to the budget of her family, which consists of her husband and 3 sons.  Mar\u00eda's one desire is to continue strengthening her business and to make it a versatile workshop so she can offer her services to direct customers as well as third parties.  This will improve her business's profitability and guarantee the financial stability which will allow her to provide a better quality of life for her

10,14,16 and 18. He has a retail shop in a nearby cell and his customers are mainly residents of the cell and the neighboring cells. He works on the shop every day and dedicates twelve hours to the business every day. He started the shop in 2005 and he has seen the business grow from one level to another. In addition to the retail shop, Deus also trades coffee which boosts his income.

She stitches for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. However, due to lack of availability of funds she is unable to meet with the daily demands of her customers. For this reason she requested a loan of Rs 40,000 from the Kashf Foundation.

\u2018do-good\u2019 driven small enterprise.\n\nMeada always wanted to help people and completed her studies with a Technical Diploma in Prosthetics and Orthotics. Since her certification in Iraq in 1991, she participated in further training courses both at home and in Jordan. Her passion to help others, her skills to deliver, and her recognition to the most needed assistance for the people in her area led her to open her own small limbs manufacturing business which she opened in 2009.\n\nThe war and continued violence characterized by blasts and bombings have killed many and have left \u2013 and continue to leave \u2013 even more people with severe injuries and missing body parts. By providing individuals with prosthetics, Meada is assisting adults and children to lead normal lives, participate in everyday activities, attend schools and overcome the challenges of living with physical disabilities, overcome the challenges of dealing with the trauma and remaining signs of horrific past events.\n \nOpening the business was not without challenges. Rent was high cost, and the really good quality raw materials for the artificial limbs are extremely expensive. The high costs would have left many without assistance as the final products would have not been affordable to the people most in need. Meada decided to work with less expensive raw materials from Turkey \u2013 rather than using the admittedly better quality, but far too expensive German materials.    \n\nSlowly Meada was able to establish her business and started to overcome the initial challenges. She gives much credit to her husband also who has helped greatly at home. Meada and her husband are raising 4 children, and at the age of 42, has the greatest potentials for the future of her business.  She is participating in the WLIFT program, taking a SME business loans and participating in business skills training and mentoring to give her the business skills that match her unique small enterprise.   \n\nShe has currently qualified for a $7000 SME loan which she would like to use for purchasing a new, bigger gas oven, as the one she is currently using is an electric one, making work during power cuts difficult. She would like to replace the engine in the Softening Machine used to make the artificial limps more comfortable. With the new, better quality engine the work will be completed faster, reducing the time for orders to be completed, and thereby allowing for more orders to be taken. With the remaining amount she will be able to purchase more raw materials.\n\nMeada has many goals and plans for the further expansion of the business, she would like to eventually add a training room to the prosthesis manufacturing facility, equipped with proper training aids to help people get used to their new prosthesis limbs. In the video she explains with her own words the future plans:\n\n\"Peace upon you! I\u2019m specialist Meada from Iraq. I have a Prosthesis Factory, Al-Jawadeen specialized prosthesis center for the physically disabled. I received a loan of $7,000 from Relief International to improve my business. I would like to expand it as my business needs a training hall with equipment for the men and women (for getting used to the prosthesis). We serve disabled adults and children; adults with prosthesis and children with supportive aids.

","en":"Yuleidis, a 23 year-old youth, sells ice cream, recharging services, cellular calls, and sweets in general for a living. She decided to start a business a year ago when she observed the potential demand in the area where she lives and her need to generate income to support her college expenses. She studies financial management and is in control of her investment. She first sold communication services and subsequently satisfied her customers by offering them ice cream. Her sales have gradually increased and now her freezer is not sufficient to respond to the requests of her customers. Ice cream is not available when they are shopping, as they sell very quickly. Her goal is to have a store and earn more income to finish her college studies. For that, she works every day of the week without stopping from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

Sadly she was not able to pursue her studies since she has had to work from the time she was very young in order to help out with household expenses.   \r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and her desire to get ahead, she works selling second hand clothing like men's and women's pants, dresses, skirts, blouses, as well as bedspreads, children's clothing, and second hand toys.  She works around ten hours per day offering her products. The goal of the credit is to invest in product. This will allow her to supply her business by purchasing and selling second hand clothing so that in the near future she can obtain a better income.  Mar\u00eda is thankful for the help that Kiva investors have offered to people with limited resources and to poor countries like Nicaragua so that people can find dignified work.

She is 21 years old, single and without children. She lives with her parents. Her family depends solely on farming such as the cultivation of coffee and consequently she helps her parents with the different activities associated with the farm. She has been doing this for more than 5 years and it was her parents who taught her how to work the land. She works together with them but she also has her own plot of land that they gave to her which is located 2km from her house. They transferred it to her unkempt with the goal that she would be able to work and to understand the value of the things that they had provided to her and achieved through lots of work over the years. She has encountered some challenges with her work in the field including pests and changes in the natural climate, but competition is not a problem she faces and she is able to sell and generate an income for her family and home.

junto a su abuela y ella ya no le permiti\u00f3 de que continuara con sus estudios, puesto que consideraba, que eso era una perdida de tiempo. Esta acompa\u00f1ada, su esposo le ayuda en el negocio. Sus tres hijos, est\u00e1n casados y ya no viven con ella, solamente vive con su esposo.\n\nBlanca ha demostrado ser una persona luchadora, con muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n, lo que la a llevado a ser una gran comerciante de Gallinas Indias, oficio que aprendi\u00f3, hace aproximadamente 34 a\u00f1os, desde que deserto de la escuela, gracias a una vecina y amiga que la apoyo, para que ella pudiera iniciar su negocio, ya que su amiga viajaba tres d\u00edas por semana, a uno de los mercados mas importantes de la capital del pa\u00eds y a Blanca por su corta edad e inexperiencia, le permiti\u00f3 que viajara junto con ella, para que no se fuera a perder, y no le pasara nada malo. As\u00ed que como Blanca una ni\u00f1a de campo, le gustaba criar gallinas, decidi\u00f3 vender una parte de las que tenia, y le fue muy bien en el negocio. Desde entonces se a dedicado a este negocio. Ahora vende aproximadamente cuatrocientas gallinas por semana, ya que el trabajo es pesado recibe ayuda de su esposo y juntos mantienen el negocio, lo que a permitido estar mas tiempo juntos y mejorar la relaci\u00f3n entre ambos.\n\nBlanca necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en el negocio de las gallinas, ya que se acerca la \u00e9poca de fin de a\u00f1o, en donde la demanda de estas aumenta considerablemente, y es necesario para ella aprovechar esta temporada de venta. Con el pr\u00e9stamo se estar\u00e1 ayudando, para que logre comprar aproximadamente trescientas cincuenta gallinas, para luego llevarlas a comercializar.\n\n\nBlanca tiene el sue\u00f1o de ampliar el negocio, y as\u00ed aumentar las ventas. Ademas le gustar\u00eda comprar un veh\u00edculo para poder trasladar las gallinas,  ya que actualmente, tiene que contratar un veh\u00edculo, lo cual aumenta los gastos de producci\u00f3n.  ","en":"Blanca is 46 years old and went to school through the fourth grade.  She grew up with her grandmother, who did not allow her to continue her studies since she thought they were a waste of time.  Blanca is married and her husband helps her with her business.  Her three children are married and no longer live at home.  Blanca lives alone with her husband.\r\n\r\nBlanca has shown herself to be a fighter, with strong desires to get ahead.  This has allowed her to become a great seller of chickens, a business that she learned approximately 34 years ago, when she left school.  Thanks to a neighbor and friend who helped her, she was able to start her own business.  Her friend traveled three days each week to one of the most important markets in the capital of the country, and she allowed Blanca, with her young age and inexperience, to accompany her so that Blanca would not get lost and nothing bad would happen to her.  So since Blanca, a country girl, liked raising chickens, the neighbor decided to sell some of those that she had, and for Blanca the business went very well.  From that time she has been working in this field.  Now she sells approximately 400 chickens per week.  Since the work is heavy, she receives help from her husband and together they maintain the business, which has allowed them to spend more time together and to improve their relationship.\r\n\r\nBlanca needs a loan in order to invest in her chicken business.  The holidays are approaching, and thus the demand increases considerably.  It is important that she take advantage of this season for sales.  With the loan she will be helped to purchase approximately 350 chickens, which she will then sell.  \r\n\r\nBlanca dreams of growing her business and thus increasing sales.

She is a dreamer, and when she was very young, she acquired agricultural knowledge from her parents, who specialized in coffee growing.  She arises in the morning, does her chores, and then goes to her workplace where she teaches classes.  She is the mother of five children.  The eldest is in high school, the next two are in primary school in different grades, and the last two are minors that don\u2019t even attend kindergarten yet.  She has been engaged in buying and selling coffee for seven years, an activity she learned from her parents as they are business people and farmers.  For years, they have sold their product to the benefit of the community, their largest and main customer.  Luisa also sells clothing during the Christmas season, which allows her to earn better and higher income for her family.  When she leaves her workplace, she goes to the country to help her husband who is in charge of various activities and she helps him with the clearing, grain collection, fertilizer application, and other activities.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of being able to continue expanding her coffee crops so that in the future, her children can inherit decent, prosperous land.  This will allow her to have land where she can live, work, and generate income for her home.

She is 29, a housewife and a farmer. She is in a common-law marriage and has three children. The eldest is going to primary school, the other two are too young to attend school.\r\nMaria Jesus learned farming thanks to her parents, whom she helped from an early age with the maintenance of the coffee crops. Her crops are located in the same community where she lives and she goes there by beast of burden. She owns the land thanks to an inheritance from her parents.\r\nIn her youth, Maria Jesus was able to complete primary education thanks to the support from her parents but could not continue studying due to lack of funding. Secondary level studies were a bit more expensive and her parents had limited resources which didn't allow them to support her studies further, but rather, only to cover basic household needs such as food, clothing, or medicines, and these with many restrictions.\r\nMaria Jesus dreams of providing a better future for her children, with better opportunities and better quality of life so that they in turn will be able to provide for all the necessities of their families. She also wants to buy land to grow more coffee, of a better variety.

She is married, and her husband works at various jobs, including masonry, gardening, and waiting on tables, among others. He emigrated to the United States because of the poverty in which they were living, but still she cannot see big changes in her family. Her children have already formed their own families, and the only ones who are with her are two grandchildren who are in her care.\r\n\r\nShe has a pupusa [a typical food of El Salvador] business. She has 13 years of experience working in this business. In the past, she made and sold tamales, and sometimes she sold fruits and vegetables, but finally she decided to stay with this business, since she considers it more profitable than the earlier ones. She learned this business (making and selling pupusas) thanks to her older sister, who taught her until she perfected the product, creating loyalty in her customers because of the quality of her pupusas.\r\n\r\nIn this Christmas season, there is a greater stream of people who arrive to enjoy her pupusas. For this reason, she needs more working capital to buy the ingredients: corn, cheese, loroco (a flower used for flavoring), pork rinds, and oil, among other things, to cover the demand and thus take advantage of this opportunity that exists. With this, she can obtain a better income, which will allow her to continue investing in the future.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to create a substantial pupuseria in the area and thus generate employment for people from the canton who seek to obtain income but don't have the opportunities that allow this and see as the only option emigration to the United States, which only causes disintegration of the
