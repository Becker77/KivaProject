She has started her work with the lending partner, Fundacion Mujer, on her own, with the aim to improve the conditions of her micro-business at a very good time for sales: Christmas and the summer holiday season in the coastal area.\r\nMaritza wishes to contribute to the household income investing this small sum of money inorder to pay back quickly and then ask for a new loan with an improved solvency rate.\r\nMaritza lives in a poor region, with limited employment opportunities. This loan will allow her to acquire merchandise, increasing her inventory to cover the demand during the holiday period. She will recover the money for the payment fees weekly, which will allow her to have a wider margin to get the money to make the payments. Maritza proves to have excellent credit references and a wide experience in commerce. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1479496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"with catalog sales, clothing and custom jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas, Fray Casiano","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2013-11-29T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-28T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.52,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":23778.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":24254.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":24739.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25234.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25739},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":26253.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.52,"local_amount":23778.87,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25652.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459105363},{"amount":52.38,"local_amount":24254.45,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":26165.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.17,"payment_id":467920228},{"amount":53.4,"local_amount":24908.92,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":26871.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.57,"payment_id":479140980},{"amount":54.25,"local_amount":25400.45,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":27401.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":490834887},{"amount":55.78,"local_amount":25745.72,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":27774.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504261011},{"amount":56.15,"local_amount":25911.59,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":27952.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543369}],"funded_date":"2013-12-01T02:31:28Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:43:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Leticia Barbero","image":835885}},{"id":638785,"name":"Jaime Ignacio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jaime Ignacio agradece a todos los inversionistas por el pr\u00e9stamo y se siente muy contento por el apoyo brindado, \u00e9l continua vendiendo ceviche en uno de los mercados m\u00e1s populares de la ciudad del Cusco, \u00e9l continua participando en el banco comunal de la Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa y le va muy bien.

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHanidina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by individual pieces. She also sells herbal medicines and religious items for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nHanidina dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week.

Lutfidin is currently unemployed; he's been looking for a job for quite a long time, but has yet to find one that pays as well as he'd like.  He has decided to start up his own business as a taxi driver; however, he lacks the money to buy a taxi.  As such, Lutfidin feels his only option is to take out a loan, and is requesting a loan for as much money as necessary to buy a Daewoo Tico to use as a taxi.  This loan will allow Lutfidin to not only have a job, but a source of stable income for his family as well.  Once he's a taxi driver, he plans on working a fixed route in the city of Dushanbe (in Gissar).

Previously they were four members, but two more people joined the group. For that reason they decided to choose this name for the association. They live in a community of the Mazahua people, where the largest festival happens on September 28 and 29. There is a big horse race; people go through the streets to Santo San Miguel; loud rockets are heard; and in the evening people light fireworks known as \"toritos\" [\"little bulls\"] or \"castillos\" [\"castles\"]. \r\n\r\nRosa, or Rosy as her friends call her, is a member of the communal bank. She is 43 years old and has been married for 24 years to Macario; together they have formed a family with nine children, two boys and seven girls. Five of them are still dependent. While Mr. Macario works in the countryside, Ms. Rosy operates a small notions store. For this reason she is requesting a loan from VisionFund and KIVA to buy more merchandise such as earrings, rings, and inexpensive bracelets. She also sells thread and checkered fabrics for sewing, among other things. She says that although these are very simple and small things, it is going very well for her. She comments that she started her business 15 years ago, because Rosy had a great desire to help her husband with the household expenses: \"I saw how my husband was working long hours, but we couldn't make ends meet, and we didn't have enough money to cover all of the household expenses and the education of all of our children.\"  \r\n\r\nShe started the business in her mother-in-law's house, but her sales were not as favorable as she had hoped, so she decided to move the business to her house. However, in her mother-in-law's house she left behind a nixtamal [corn] mill which is also profitable. Rosy is very happy with her business, and she says that she wants to continue working hard and not abandon it, because currently her biggest difficulty is the competition within her community. Rosy comments: \u201cMy biggest dream is to be able to improve the store, because now it is only roofed with sheet metal, and to expand it to sell other items.\" Rosy also has the desire to buy a small truck and go out to \"ranchar\" (offer her products in other communities). In this way she will be able to increase her earnings to pay for the household expenses and her children's education. The other members of the group are Gloria, who will invest her loan in chickens and embroidered items; Teresa, who will buy sheep; Martina, who will obtain some turkeys; Miriam, who will invest in pigs; and Catalina, who will buy a nixtamal mill. All of them are very grateful to VisionFund and KIVA for the loan, because it will help them in various ways with their economic activities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1478626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy beads, earrings, necklaces, rings, checkered fabric, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel Agua Bendita, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":691.67,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-04T10:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":9042.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877978},{"amount":345.83,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4521.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449767008},{"amount":345.83,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4521.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247809},{"amount":345.84,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4521.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072863},{"amount":345.83,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4521.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479290182}],"funded_date":"2013-12-02T22:57:33Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T21:55:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":639270,"name":"Martha Azucena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha Azucena de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera con tres hijos, es originaria de Leon, lugar que est\u00e1 ubicado en la zona de occidente del pa\u00eds, se caracteriza por ser trabajadora, responsable, con ganas de superaci\u00f3n personal.

The majority of them earn a living by growing corn. \r\n\r\nJuan, who is the group's representative, says that they chose the name \"Zarzamora\" for the group due to the fact that the area where he lived and spent his childhood has a lot of Zarzamora, a fruit typical to this region. In the area, the fruit is known as \"Ro Gu\" in the mother tongue. \r\n\r\nJuan is 38 years old, and has been married to Veronica for 19 years. They have a family of five children, of whom four as still in school. Juan earns a living by fattening and selling sheep. He has been doing this for 8 years, and he says that his sheep reproduce quickly, and they sell fast. He buys them when they are small in order to raise and fatten them, typically for a period of 6 months. He sells them to people who sell the barbecued meat. He hasn't encountered any difficulties. He works during the year to grow corn and oats to ensure that his sheep have food. If they get sick, he takes them immediately to the vet for treatment.\r\n\r\nJuan says, \"I like this job very much since while I work and earn a living, my wife takes care of the sheep so that when they are fully grown, we can sell them and earn more income to improve our family's quality of life.\" \r\n\r\nJuan, Mar\u00eda Julia, Hilaria, and Rosalinda are very happy and grateful to VisionFund and KIVA, as due to the loan then can buy more sheep."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":1478619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel La Labor, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":3150,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6081.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6313.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6620.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7046.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7285.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7652.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":467.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":485.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":508.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":559.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":467.27,"local_amount":6082.08,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-04T10:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6109.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877980},{"amount":485.06,"local_amount":6313.65,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6341.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449767010},{"amount":508.66,"local_amount":6620.82,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-31T08:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6650.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247811},{"amount":541.36,"local_amount":7046.45,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7077.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072865},{"amount":559.75,"local_amount":7285.77,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":7318.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479290184},{"amount":587.9,"local_amount":7651.23,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7685.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490986593}],"funded_date":"2013-12-04T14:15:01Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T20:30:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepti Limaye","image":1365774}},{"id":639577,"name":"Nodar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nodar is 58 years old.

Unfortunately, because of the lack of economic resources, and the need to work starting at a young age, Jose was not able to study for a professional degree. \r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, Jose works in his small carpentry shop. He makes doors, tables, chairs and other items. Jose works every day for approximately 10 hours, and he believes it is going well for him because of his dedication and effort. \r\n\r\nJose is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help provided to him, he will be able to carry out improvements to his home. He wants to reinforce the walls and lay a concrete floor in his home. In this way, Jose will keep working and exerting himself to achieve his great dream of having a secure and appropriate place for his family to live.

That way he'll be able to obtain a little more profit, and therefore Alberto will continue to work and strive to achieve his biggest dream of owning his own house."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1480489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase garments for selling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T01:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T01:30:08Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":165.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":168.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":175.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":190.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":189.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":198.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":204.39},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":214.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":220.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":229.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":247.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":257.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":639587,"name":"Zuhura","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zuhura sells fruits and green vegetables.

es una persona muy trabajadora muy dedicada a su trabajo, tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada  desde hace 25 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Rosendo quien trabaja en su propio taxi, juntos formaron una familia con tres hijos de los cuales ya ninguno depende de dicha pareja. Do\u00f1a Esperanza se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de gorros, bufandas, guantes, capas, calentadores y medias  de estambre desde hace 38 a\u00f1os pl\u00e1tica que desde  los 7 a\u00f1os ten\u00eda un gran deseo por iniciar a bordar pero no tenia material para aprender sin embargo se las ingenio para tener un estambre. \u201cUn d\u00eda tome un su\u00e9ter y unas tijeras de mi mam\u00e1, busque un buen lugar para esconderme y cortar el su\u00e9ter de mi mam\u00e1 y as\u00ed obtener estambre, el gancho ya lo tenia me lo encontr\u00e9 en la calle rumbo a mi escuela\u201d Do\u00f1a Esperanza estaba muy contenta porque ya tenia estambre, pero su mam\u00e1 se encontraba disgustada  porque era su su\u00e9ter favorito y Do\u00f1a Esperanza lo hab\u00eda destruido. \u201cMi mam\u00e1 me rega\u00f1o por lo que hab\u00eda hecho, pero finalmente me compro estambres de colores para iniciar a bordar\u201d. En ese momento no sab\u00eda bordar pero aprendi\u00f3 de unos familiares que tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a la elaboraci\u00f3n de artesan\u00eda toan solo con verlos. Cuando ya ten\u00eda varias piezas a esa misma edad inicio a salir a las ciudades grandes para vender su artesan\u00eda y con sus primeras ganancias le repuso el su\u00e9ter a su mam\u00e1. Y desde entonces se ha dedicado a elaborar productos bordados para la temporada de fr\u00edos todo el a\u00f1o trabajan pero las \u00e9pocas buenas son en el invierno desde hace 6 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 fuera de su casa por una temporada larga porque en el lugar donde vive sus artesan\u00edas se las pagan muy baratas y en otros lugares es mejor remunerada. Esta vez est\u00e1n solicitando un cr\u00e9dito a VisionFund y KIVA  para comprar estambre y tambi\u00e9n m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda pero de otro material porque tambi\u00e9n se los solicitan sus clientes porque no les gusta el estambre, porque muchas veces si alguno de sus clientes le solicita un articulo especial necesita elmaterial, la combinaci\u00f3n y modelos son creatividad de Do\u00f1a esperanza  para realizar alguna prenda solo necesita de algunos minutos para tenerlos listos. El \u00fanico  reto de Do\u00f1a Esperanza es la falta de dinero para invertir un poco mas porque el material ya es muy caro por eso mismo el pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 de gran ayuda para su negocio. Do\u00f1a Esperanza comento \u201cMe hace muy feliz continuar con mi actividad me gusta mucho creo que tengo el don de elaborar los bordados\u201d. El sue\u00f1o de Do\u00f1a Esperanza es poder terminar sus locales que tiene en su casa para prest\u00e1rselos a una de sus sobrinas y junto con ella para arrancar nuevos negocios pero tambi\u00e9n quiere comprar animales para obtener mas ingresos.","en":"Do\u00f1a Esperanza, 44, is a friendly, good-natured woman, but she's serious about her work.  She and her husband, Rosendo, have been married for 25 years and have three grown children.  Rosendo has his own taxi business and Do\u00f1a Esperanza has operated a knitwear products business for 38 years.  She makes hats, scarves, gloves, etc. and tells us that she decided at 7 years old to learn to knit even though she had no materials to practice with.  \"One day, I took a sweater and a pair of scissors, found a place to hide and cut up the sweater--my mother's!--to make the yarn I needed.\"  Do\u00f1a Esperanza was happy with the result, but her mother less so because it was a favorite sweater.  \"My mother scolded me for ruining the sweater, then bought balls of yarn in different colors so that I could start knitting in earnest.\"  She learned by watching relatives who had businesses similar to the one that she has now and when she had pieces good enough to sell, she sold them in the market.  And she used the money that she made from her first sales to buy her mother a new sweater.  She has earned a living from making and selling knitted products ever since.  She works year-round, but knitwear is most in demand during the winter when it's coldest.  Local prices for her products are low so, for the last 6 years, she has sold what she makes in other parts where buyers pay more.  Do\u00f1a Esperanza is applying to VisionFund and Kiva for a loan that she will use to buy yarn and the other supplies that she needs to continue her knitwear business.  She designs all of her creations and only needs a few minutes to make them, but her materials are expensive and she needs help to buy them.  The loan will be a great help to her, she says: \"It makes me happy to know that I can carry the business forward . . . I enjoy it very much and think that I have a gift for making the products that I make\".  For the future, she wants to finish renovating space for shops at her house that she can loan to her nieces for businesses that they can operate together. She would also like to set up an animal-sales business that would generate an extra income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1478602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

The most prominent feast is when Santa Ana is celebrated. Jacinto is 32 years old. He's married to Fabiola, and together they have made a family with two children. Jacinto has owned a taxi for the past five years. He started this business because there were no other people providing these services. At first he didn't have all his papers in order but thanks to his first loan with VisionFund, he was able to legalize his business with the authorities. Jacinto is very glad to see his dream come true, because now he can drive freely around his community and his town. However, his biggest difficulty is the competition, since several new taxi stands have been opening in the past few months. This time Jacinto requested a loan in order to use it to purchase spare parts for his taxi.

Alma lives in a quiet rural town in a traditional Mazahua area where local people have held on to their language and traditions.  Alma is a friendly, good-natured woman, but serious about the craft products that she makes: \"I learned to make these when I was just a girl . . . my mother made silver earrings, necklaces, rings, key chains and other silver craft products and I learned at her knee\".  Alma started with just an ounce of silver and slowly built her business by using her earnings from the products she made to buy more silver and make more elaborate products.  Alma says that she and her husband make a living making and selling her products and that she values the chance to teach others about Mazahuan culture.  She has been buying tools for making her products for six years and says: \"Making earrings takes us about two days, the first to smelt and shape the silver and the second to solder the loose pieces together to create the final design\".

Con mucho esfuerzo ella ha salido adelante ya que su pareja hace 6 meses tuvo un accidente automovil\u00edstico en el cual quedo invalido.

She has a technical degree in computer technology but decided to help her parents with their coffee crops, and began to work on that. She's in a common law marriage and from this relationship with her live-in partner she has a 2-year-old son. She has been getting ahead with a great deal of effort, since six months ago her partner was in a car accident that left him disabled. A few months ago he had surgery on his spine but the results weren't positive. She has been working on the coffee crops alone ever since. This has been very difficult, because she has to do all the work. Occasionally, her siblings help her out, but it's not permanent - only when the work gets piled up. Her parents taught her to grow coffee. She acquired the knowledge she needed to work and get an income for herself and her family, and she has made the most of it. She owns a total of 4.5 manzanas, of which 2.5 are in production and 2 are being sowed (1 manzana equals about 1.740 acres). Part of the land she inherited from her parents and part of it they purchased by making an effort, and it's located 25 minutes away from where she lives. She gets around in a vehicle and picks up the people who help her reap the coffee, then in the afternoon she drops them off again at the meeting point. One of the challenges she faces is that people may take advantage of her because she's a woman, and that the middleman may not buy her coffee at fair prices. That's the reason why she requests a loan from COMIXMUL in order to purchase farm supplies with which she'll maintain her coffee crops. That way she'll have an excellent harvest and she'll be able to increase her profits for the sake of her family's well-being.\r\nErika's goal is to improve her earnings so that she can get herself and her family ahead, and therefore be able to buy more land in order to keep on growing more crops. She also aims to be able to help her husband get a second operation so that he can walk again. As a mother, she aims to leave her son a legacy and ensure his future so that he can become a professional and a decent person."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1480471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase farm supplies so she can maintain her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T02:50:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Rachel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":15390,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895356}],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T16:38:42Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":639293,"name":"Encarnacion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Encarnaci\u00f3n agradece a los inversionistas por el pr\u00e9stamo y se siente contenta por el apoyo brindado, ella continua trabajando elaborando tejidos y trabajando como empleado de hogar, Encarnaci\u00f3n solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de lana de alpaca para elaborar chompas para su negocio.

In order to generate more funds and improve the standard of living for his family members, Khvicha plans to buy a minibus and work on the line. If his loan is financed on the Kiva website, Khvicha will pay for a minibus and transport passengers from his district to the capital city.

With a loan of 2,500 GEL, Liuza will purchase a stock of basic groceries such as rice, salt, sugar, oil, etc., to start a store. Liuza owns commercial space so she will save rental costs. She will work as a salesperson herself and serve the clients in a friendly way. Liuza is a very determined lady and hopes her project will be lucrative.

He is a 33-year-old resident of a village in the Qubadiyon region of Tajikistan.  He would like to start his own business, but lacks the capital to do so; being a successful livestock farmer takes not only a lot of time, but money as well.  For instance, any cattle of good stock cost upwards of $1000 USD.  All the same, Shurat is not seeking to borrow a whole lot of money.  He doesn't like to take risks, and would much rather start small than risk everything at the outset.  He plans on taking out a loan to buy only a couple of cows for starters.  After he determines when they've been fattened enough and are ready to sell, he'll sell the cows at a local market for more than he paid for and make a tidy profit.  He hopes to earn an honest wage by dealing in cattle, and grow his business over time.  First and foremost, he needs to get his business up and running, and hopes you'll help him by contributing to his loan!"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1482460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"set up a new livestock-raising business and buy some bull calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qubadiyon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shuhrat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":327.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":336.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":346.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":355.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":365.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":376.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":386.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":397.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":408.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":431.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":443.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":456.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":469.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":482.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":495.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":509.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":523.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":538.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":553.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":569.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":585.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":601.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":618.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":639353,"name":"Maritza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maritza, de 50 a\u00f1os, es una mujer valiente y trabajadora, est\u00e1 casada con Max y con \u00e9l tiene 6 hijos, 2 de los cuales aun viven junto a ella y su esposo en su casa propia.

Most women still wear their very colorful traditional garments. The most celebrated holiday in this community is September 14, \"The Lord of the Miracles\" day. \r\n\r\nAlejandra is a hard-working woman aged 45. She is married to Jos\u00e9 since 25 years back, and they have formed a family with nine children whereof three are still dependent on their parents. Jos\u00e9 works in the field and Alejandra breeds and fattens chickens, turkeys, and sheep and then sells them to neighbors, friends, and relatives. \r\n\r\nShe has been running this business for three years and she says she started it when she was offered her first VisionFund loan, thinking that this activity could help her pay for the household expenses and for her children's education. Alejandra has already completed several loan cycles and thanks to that she has been able to buy her little animals. \r\n\r\n\"Thanks to the VisionFund loans and to Kiva, my family has received many benefits because now we can pay for my children's studies without any difficulties.\" She comments that the only hardship is when her animals get sick, or even die. This makes Alejandra very sad because it entails losses in investments and income. She says that it is very easy and comfortable to raise animals because she can keep an eye on her children while she is taking care of her animals. Alejandra's dream is to be able to continue raising her animals, thus continuing paying for the costs of her children without difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are Victoria, who sells fruits and vegetables; Julia, who raises sheep; Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Leticia who run grocery stores; Alberto, who will rent centerings for construction; and Bonifacia, who raises turkeys. They are all grateful to VisionFund and to Kiva for the loan they have been offered, because it will help them to grow their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1477382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens, turkeys, and sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dotegiare, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T11:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T11:50:04Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberto Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Bonifacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-04T10:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":14054.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877984},{"amount":469.11,"local_amount":6109.32,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-04T10:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6133.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449767014},{"amount":605.89,"local_amount":7890.68,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-31T08:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":7921.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247815}],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T14:33:34Z","paid_date":"2014-03-31T08:58:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Isabel Valencia","image":1247399}},{"id":640528,"name":"Akiba Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Saleh fait partie du groupe  Akiba et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

She is married and has one child with whom she lives in the house she owns. Her business is selling food and soft drinks that she prepares herself. Her stall is located in a market close to her home. She works every day from morning to evening. Sometimes her sales are very good when she is able to sell all her products during the day. She works together with her sister. \r\n\r\nShe has been running this business for 12  years, always with a lot of care. Occasionally she sells fish and chickens, too. She started out buying small quantities of inputs, and her capital increased little by little until she was able to buy larger quantities of products. She considers this business profitable because it consistently brings her good incomes. She comments that she decided to start this business with her family's well-being in mind and in order to help her husband cover for the household expenses. Now she is hoping to establish another stall and increase her income. \r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting 1,000 PEN and she is grateful for the opportunity offered, which allows her to continue working to achieve her goals. She pledges to be a punctual and responsible borrower just like the rest of her group.

She works at the business 12 hours per day and six days per week. Fatmata says that the main challenge to her business is the problem of price control in the market.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy food commodities like cooking seasoning, oil and rice for her business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and build a permanent structure. In the future, she plans to open a restaurant.

She doesn\u2019t have any children but is two months pregnant.  She has an incomplete middle school education, since she had already gotten together with her current husband.  He is the only one who works in the fields because he will not let her work because of her pregnancy, so she spends her time cooking and doing the housework.  She learned to work in the fields as a child, and her parents taught her to raise coffee.  She learned what she needed to develop her skills and she and her husband have four plots of farmland they got through their own efforts.

She is single and blessed with two children. She began her business because she wants to be self-employed and take care of her parent. In 2012, Jestina established her retail business. She works at the business from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and insufficient capital to expand her business. Jestina applied for a loan in order to buy more assorted drinks and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and have a permanent business location. In the future, Jestina plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1481356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She studied through high school and then met someone and had a baby.  A while afterwards, she separated from him.  She studied a nursing career but never actually worked in this profession due to the fact that it is very difficult to find work; a person needs to know someone in order to actually find a position in a health center or public clinic.  \r\n\r\nLater, she found a person to spend her life with, and together they have twins (her first son lives with his grandmother).  With this new relationship and through their combined efforts, Wendy and her life partner bought a plot of land and constructed a home.  Her eldest son is seven years old and is in second grade.  The twins are four years old and are in preschool.  \r\n\r\nShe makes a living growing coffee; she learned how to grow and harvest coffee from her parents when she was a young girl.  She has one plot of land and all of it is dedicated to producing coffee.  She acquired this farmland through her own efforts, and it is located in the area behind her house.

She has been running a grocery store for two years. During summer time, she and her husband make and sell boardwalk decks to local people. Their elder daughter studies at technology college. \r\n\r\nUsing her previous loan, she made an extension to her house, as well as insulated the walls. Now she is requesting a loan of MNT 6,000,000 to buy vacuum insulated windows, a low pressure heater and hardwood floor.

She is well-bred and educated.  Ruslana is serious about minding her expenses and she keeps to a strict budget.  Thanks to her earlier loan, Ruslana replaced her door (as you can see in the photo) and repaired her floors.  However, she was not able to finish all the repairs and she needs additional funds.  \r\n\r\nThis time, Ruslana is requesting a loan of 20,000 UAH to fix the bathroom.  The bathroom was installed way back in Soviet times and now it looks just awful.

help of her son and her mother.  They live in a village and have a large plot of land.  Over the last 10 years, they built three large greenhouses, and they have two others for seedlings.  Last year they installed a heating system.  Larisa reports that this was a big improvement.  She says, \"we work as hard as before, but our income is much bigger!\"  It was difficult for her to raise her son alone.  They never had enough money, but now she is joyful because they now have some security and success, and with her son now grown, she has someone on whom she can rely.\r\n\r\nThe loans really help Larisa.

However, this year like many farmers, Natalya and her neighbors suffered from unseasonable frosts.  In the spring, Natalya tried to save her cucumbers, but nonetheless they all froze.  So she replanted and was able to reap a good harvest, but later than she had planned.  This means that her profits were less than planned.  But Natalya didn't give up hope--she is a very up-beat person.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her income next year, Natalya is planning to build an additional greenhouse on her land, for which she is requesting a loan of 30,000 hryvni (UAH).

She stayed in school through the third grade since her parents, people of few means, could not support her or provide her with the opportunity to become a professional. Ever since she was very young, she has been in the business of raising coffee, having learned from her father the necessary techniques for planting, fertilizing, growing and harvesting the bean so that it could then be washed, dried, and depulped, and then finally sold to the various buyers that come from all over the region. The land that she and her husband work is theirs partly thanks to an inheritance from her father; it is located twenty minutes walking from their home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Antonia dreams of expanding her coffee plantings by buying more land, thus increasing her income for her family and home and helping her only son to complete his schooling and attend university. He will be able to prepare himself to have greater opportunities in life.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting today will be used to buy agricultural supplies which she will invest in her coffee fields. These will be what helps strengthen her family's economic situation at the end of the season.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":487.5,"image":{"id":1480643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Elmira works in agriculture. She grows and sells cacao beans and plaintains. She has five years experience in the field. She got into this work because her father was a farmer, and he got her into agricultural work from an early age, planting cacao and maize. The principal problem in this work is the strong variation that the price of cacao grain and corn can suffer during the season, but thanks to her experience and knowledge she has been able to get ahead with her production, and her goal now is to increase the plots she can cultivate and change her standard production to a certified organic cacao production.

Her profits from business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nDema hopes for the continuous success of her business and desires for her family to be closer to God. Every week, she meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and to repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1481609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Lupita comments that \"in my family, knowledge of embroidery has been passed down through the generations.\"  \r\n\r\nLupita's husband taught her to stitch.  She makes these products all through the year, but unfortunately her work is not valued, because her pay is very little.  However, she is requesting a loan to buy wool yarn to make her embroidered products, because in this season of every year, she goes to another city to sell her handicrafts.  This is the best way for her to obtain the highest earnings, although it is very risky to travel to these cities.  The difficulty that Lupita is experiencing is that she lacks the money to stock up on merchandise and buy more yarn.  In the place where she sells, her customers ask for special garments, and she needs wool in various colors.  Lupita tells us that she develops her styles and color combinations by observing how people dress, and her work is very unique.  With her aunt, she has plans to open new businesses, including the sale of clothing and a grocery store.  Lupita will tend to the 2 businesses, because she can not go out to work in more distant places because she suffers from a back injury."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1478607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

He offers financial services to people in his community by providing the service of money transfers and bill payments.\r\n\r\nAllan started running his business two years ago with the start up capital of $1,000, which he borrowed from some of his family. He has slowly built up his cash and is now working with a working capital float of $2,900. The proceeds from the business help Allan to provide for his family as it is his only source of income.

For the past year,  Samali has been working hard to manage her small business, which does tailoring. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Samali has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more materials for making clothes to sell, and will help Samali to generate greater profits and improve on the family\u2019s standard of living. Samali hopes that in the future she will be able to construct rental houses of her own. \r\n\r\nSamali is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Farming has been his main source of income for 5 years.  He produces and sells milk and maize.  He enjoys farming because of the return he gets for the work.  The challenge he faces is that sometimes there are long rains or cold weather that destroy his crops. \r\n\r\nKevin chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because of testimonies from other farmers of how Juhudi has helped them to improve their livelihood.  Therefore, he decided to give it a try and he found out that it was worth it.

For the past year, Christine has been working hard to manage her retail shop which sells drinks and nuts. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christine has requested a loan of 200,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more  drinks such as soda, water, and milk for resale, and will help Christine to generate greater profits and take care of her family.

She is married and has three children, two of whom are currently in school. For the past two years, Ann has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Ann has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more beans, maize flour and rice for sale, which will help Ann to generate greater profits and pay for school necessities for her children. Ann hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nAnn is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Asere has been working hard to manage her brew business, which sells local brews. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Asere has requested a loan of 350,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more pots, wood straws and millet for the business, and it will help Asere to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Asere hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a cow for her son. \r\n\r\nAsere is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells round palm sized rugs for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nEmelita dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes to have a better living.
