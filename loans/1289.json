He is a father of three and they all go to school. He would like to use this Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizers for rice production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase rice production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. He was very thankful for the previous loan, which he used to obtain more returns from rice production.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

El primer hijo trabaja en la capital, la segunda  hija trabaja en la alcald\u00eda municipal, el tercero  vive en Estados Unidos y el cuarto que actualmente est\u00e1 estudiando segundo a\u00f1o de Lic. En ciencias jur\u00eddicas.\n\nDon Dimas, se dedica a la cr\u00eda y explotaci\u00f3n de aves ponedoras, tambi\u00e9n tiene un peque\u00f1o taller de estructuras met\u00e1licas, donde elabora puertas, ventanas, etc.  Tiene 15 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la explotaci\u00f3n de aves, sus padres siempre  manten\u00eda aves en su casa, luego decidi\u00f3 ir a un agroservicio a pedir  asesor\u00eda t\u00e9cnica sobre esta actividad; la cual le facilitaron. En seguida compro 200 pollas y con los conocimientos logro tenerlas hasta el final de la postura, luego las descarto y meti\u00f3 un nuevo lote, fue como le gusto la actividad y sigue trabajando en ello hasta la fecha. \n\nAntes de esta actividad solo se dedicaba a la siembra de granos b\u00e1sicos,  por la falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos. La granja donde est\u00e1n las aves esta a 1km de su casa; ya que por higiene no puede tenerlas m\u00e1s cerca de su casa y para llegar se moviliza a veces en el carro o en bicicleta o a pie, al cuido de las gallinas le ayuda su esposa. Generalmente trabaja de 7 am a 5 de la tarde.\n\n\n   Don Dimas con el financiamiento, comprara 40 quintales de concentrado. El cr\u00e9dito mejorara su calidad de vida, ya que  comprar  todo el concentrado y no estar viajando seguido al agroservicio e incurrir en m\u00e1s gastos de transporte. El cr\u00e9dito mejorara  sus ingresos y cubrira as\u00ed las necesidades b\u00e1sicas de su familia.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es seguir trabajando con aves, ampliar sus galeras para meter m\u00e1s pollas,  que le generen m\u00e1s ingresos y con sus ganancias ayudar  a su hijo para que termine la carrera que a elegido.\n\n","en":"Dimas, 66, studied up to sixth grade.  He's married and his wife works on the farm taking care of their laying hens.  His oldest child works in the capital and his next one, a daughter, works for the city.  The third one lives in the United States and the fourth one is currently a student in his second year of legal studies.\r\n\r\nDimas makes a living raising and selling laying hens.  He also has a small metal shop where he fabricates doors, windows, and the like.  He has sold chickens for 15 years.  His parents always had poultry at home.  Then he decided to go to an agroservice for technical advice about this job.  On their advice he immediately bought 200 hens and because of his knowledge managed to keep them until they stopped laying.  Then he got rid of them and bought another lot.  He liked the work and has continued with it up to the present.\r\n\r\nBefore this job Dimas worked growing basic grains because of a lack of economic resources.  The farm where he keeps his poultry is a kilometer from his house; he can't keep them closer because of hygiene issues.  He gets there by car or bicycle or on foot.  His wife helps him take care of the hens.  He generally works from 7 a.m. until 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nDimas will buy 40 quintals of concentrated feed with the loan.  It will improve his quality of life because he'll buy the feed all at once and not have to travel frequently to the agroservice.  The loan will improve his income and cover his family's basic necessities.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to continue working with poultry and expand his coops with more hens to generate more income.  With his profits he wants to help his son finish his chosen educational program.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1539.6,"image":{"id":1480637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Cows are never raised for beef, but are raised for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1482012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

With the help of her husband Armine is extensively engaged in agribusiness which is the main source of the family's income. They are involved in cattle breeding, in aviculture, in breeding a livestock of sheep, and in beekeeping. Armine's husband sells the agricultural products in the local market. Armine and her husband work hard to be able to cover the increasing needs of the family. As life is getting more expensive day by day, Armine wants to expand her agribusiness a little bit to be able to meet the daily costs of the family more effectively. She needs a loan of USD 2000 to purchase two cows. As this is Armine\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. She and her family will be very thankful to the lenders for their goodwill and support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1482087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

To assist her family members in earning a living Karine is engaged in cattle breeding and in breeding a livestock of piglets. She sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is an important source of her family's income. To sustain her agribusiness and develop it further Karine needs a loan of USD 1300 to purchase a cow and a pig. As this is Karine\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history.

She lives with her husband, one-year-old daughter, and mother-in-law.  Gayane's husband is employed in the private sector and is the main breadwinner of the family. With the help of her mother-in-law, Gayane is engaged in cattle breeding. They sell the agricultural products in the local market, which is an essential source of the family's income. As life is getting more expensive on a day-to-day basis, it becomes harder to make ends meet. This is why Gayane wants to expand her agribusiness in order to be able to more effectively meet the increasing needs of her family. A loan of 1,500 USD will be a great support to this young, hard-working woman and her family, enabling them to purchase ten pigs. As this is Gayane\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn't have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. Gayane and her family rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will be very thankful to them for their help in collecting the needed loan amount in order to maintain and develop their

She lives with her husband, son, and daughter. She works at the village local school as a teacher. Her salary, however, is not enough to meet the basic needs of her family. With the help of her family members Svetik is extensively engaged in agribusiness, which is the most important source of her family's income. For more than 17 years, Svetik has been involved in cattle breeding, in aviculture, in breeding a livestock of sheep, in beekeeping, and in cultivation of wheat and grass. They sell the agricultural products in the local market. As it becomes harder to earn a living over time, Svetik wants to expand her agribusiness in order to more effectively meet the daily costs of her family. A loan of USD 3000 will be a great support to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling her to purchase 28 sheep. Svetik and her family rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will highly appreciate their support.

Her son helps her sell the agricultural products in the local market, which is a very important source of income for them. \r\n\r\nTo continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Julieta needs a loan of $3,000 to renovate the barn, to purchase two calves, to buy wheat seeds, and to pay for the harvesting services. She and her son highly rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will be thankful to them for the support in collecting the needed loan to maintain and develop their agribusiness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2862.8,"image":{"id":1482041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives with her husband and two little sons (7 and 5 years old, and shown in the photo). \r\n\r\nHaykanush works at the village local school as a teacher. Unfortunately, the teacher salary is so low that she cannot afford a living based on that salary alone. With the help of her husband, it has already been more than five years since Haykanush became engaged in aviculture. They have a farm of 2,000 hens. Haykanush and her husband sell the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of their income. \r\n\r\nIn order to continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way and to develop it further, Haykanush needs to make some investments.

He realized this dream about two years ago when he opened his shop with a sewing machine and started to offer service to third parties.  Little by little he grew, and today he has eleven machines and the help of five direct employees who work with him every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m.  He has recognition in the market and generates the money he needs to pay for his family's basic necessities.\r\n\r\nRam\u00f3n's requesting the current loan to buy a sewing machine and an overlock machine so he can increase his production, reduce his production time, and optimize his shop even more.  This will generate a higher level of income and the possibility of acquiring new and bigger contracts, because now he has the capacity.\r\n\r\nThis allows Ram\u00f3n to continue making progress in his job and opens the door to the future possibility of being able to achieve his dream of putting out his own line of clothing.

They asked for a 160,000 YER loan from AMB to buy different types of businesses. Nadia, 37 years old and a married woman with seven children, she is the leader of the group. She is illiterate and a good mother. She loves her husband and children very much and wants to do her best to see them happy. She knows that her husband's income can't cover all their needs, so she thought of starting up a small business.\r\n\r\nShe has a mill (\"tahoun\") and has been involved in purchasing grains then selling them to her customers after milling. She started her business because it has fast sales in the market and is attractive to business partners. She is an incredibly hard-working woman and as a result has a lot of experience. She said she provides people a service to put food on the table.

This is because her family was poor and everyone had to work so that they could eat. Her job was to sell candy on different bus routes around the city. She grew up in a commercial enviroment and thanks to this she has managed to set up a small stall that she holds on one of the streets downtown where she sells knitted woollen clothing and other items. She has been running the stall for 10 years and is well-known in the area. She has the advantage of being able to decide her own hours and can manage her resources. Her main challenges are the dangers she faces on the streets and the dramatic changes of temperature. Moreover, she does not receive any social security. Nevertheless, she carrys on working hard and, in this way, generates enough income to be able to provide for her family's basic needs. Her drive, determination and tenacity have led to to look for other ways to carry on improving and this is why she is requesting a loan to buy products at wholesale (jackets, balaclavas, scarves, gloves, and other knitted clothing). This will allow her to have a wider variety of items to sell and meet customer demand which increases during the winter months, and therefore increase her income. Sonia will continue to work hard to achieve her goal of selling her goods in a store where she will be more comfortable and will not be exposed to as many risks as she is on the street. She will also be able to improve her sales and give herself financial stability which will guarantee a better quality of life for her and her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1480848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy items at wholesale (jackets, balaclavas, scarves, gloves, and other wool products).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107094},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110058},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113105},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116235},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119453},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122759},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126157},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129649},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133238},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136926},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140716},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144610}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.9,"local_amount":102943,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":105888.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450585685},{"amount":121.24,"local_amount":227314,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":233817.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523730},{"amount":59.61,"local_amount":111761,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":114958.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227409},{"amount":63.69,"local_amount":119425,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":122841.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245052},{"amount":65.49,"local_amount":122785,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":126297.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855803},{"amount":67.33,"local_amount":126235,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":129846.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282555},{"amount":69.17,"local_amount":129685,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":133395.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520982909},{"amount":298.57,"local_amount":559852,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":575868.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531789639}],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T21:40:46Z","paid_date":"2014-09-25T09:25:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":640631,"name":"Matile","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matile is 49 years old and a partnered woman with four children.

From a young age, she discovered that she had a passion for art, painting and crafts. For this reason, she took a course and started selling different decorative items for the home, such as figurines made of plaster and bedspreads to family members, neighbors and friends. Through this, she has managed to generate income to support her husband with the household expenses. She is a very creative and organized person who is dedicated to her family and her work. This has led her to request the support of a loan to buy supplies and tools (paintbrushes, fabric, thread, paints, plaster and ceramic figurines,etc). If she has these supplies, she will be able to create her handicrafts and satisfy the demand that increases during the holiday season, which means that she will increase her income and be able to carry on contributing towards the household expenses and be able to invest in her business. Margarita dreams of taking her business a step further by transferring her workshop to commercial premises where she would also be able to sell her products. This would improve sales and allow her to reach more customers, and  as a consequence would mean that she could improve the quality of hers and her family's life so that they can live more comfortably."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1480853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

After this loan, Otara will be able to be more independent and help give her family a better standard of living. Otara is an entrepreneur at heart and has big dreams of one day owning a large dairy farm.\r\n\r\nThe women in the group also plan to save the money they earn from expanding their businesses to buy a food processing machine which they can all use to make spices and pickle vegetables together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1481578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more cows and expand her dairy farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Balipatna, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T04:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T04:10:09Z","loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Otara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kosala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhunubala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":225000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":225000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-08T11:00:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":640647,"name":"Tae","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tae is a 44-year-old married woman with 7 children.

","en":"Arcenia has been raising and selling pigs for the past two years, a trade that she learned from her relatives from an early age. She started her business by buying a few pigs and used some savings that she had to fatten them and sacrifice them so that they could be sold by the kilo. As she made a good profit, she decided to buy more pigs to fatten and started working daily in this area. In this way, she has been able to generate income to take home to her family, which is made up of her husband and their two children. Her drive, commitment and dedication have led her to look for ways to get ahead, and that is why she is requesting a loan which she will use to buy more pigs and concentrate for fattening. This will help to increase production and satisfy the demand for this type of meat, which goes up during the month of December, This will mean that she increases her family's income and will have the opportunity to grow her business and perhaps even fulfil her dream of finding bigger premises so that she can have more animals, All of this would mean that Arcenia could strengthen and improve her business in order to improve the quality of life and well-being of her loved ones."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1480861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy more pigs and concentrate for fattening.

He works in his own business, a vegetable store that he started several months ago as an alternative to earn his own income. The idea came to him when he was let go from a supermarket where he had worked for several years. He had various duties there, and among them was tending to the area of fruits and vegetables. That was where he got experience and it was one more motivation to start his own business. The business is located next to the supermarket where he used to work, and because of this he has the advantage of being recognized in the neighborhood, which gets a lot of traffic. He works there on his own every day and in this way he earns the income to provide the basic necessities for his family. He is currently requesting a loan to invest it in the purchase of shelves, a refrigerator, and to make some improvements to the store (paint it). This way he will give the business a better image and attract new customers so that he can increase his sales and the income he receives. Wilder wants to continue with his work and strengthen his business every day because it has become his principal source of income, which he can use to provide for better well being and living conditions for the people he loves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1480899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy shelves, a refrigerator, and to make some improvements to the store (paint it).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T07:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T07:50:07Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilder Edilson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87220},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89634},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92115},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94665},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97286},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99978},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102746},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105590},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108513},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111516},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114603},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117775},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121035},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124385},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127828},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131367},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135003},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138741}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.88,"local_amount":178819,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":181060.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450585686},{"amount":47.33,"local_amount":90150,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:51:25Z","rounded_local_amount":91280.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523737},{"amount":102.03,"local_amount":194340,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":196776.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227414},{"amount":806.76,"local_amount":1536691,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1555955.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245056}],"funded_date":"2014-01-29T15:10:24Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:58:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":640671,"name":"Joma'a","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joma\u2019a is 21 years old and lives with his family in Ramallah.

They both live in a four-bedroom apartment in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges in life among which are inadequate finances to increase her business and cater to her family's needs, sickness, death and accidents.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan requested, she will expand her business by buying manure, seedlings, medicine and a sprayer that she will use in watering her farm. In addition to that she will increase her farm size. She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has been doing it for a long time. Furthermore, she has regular customers who buy her products - especially vegetables and spices that are always in high demand. With this business activity, the community will benefit from her moderate selling prices, the distance to buy from the market will be reduced, and vegetables also provide vitamins to the consumers.\r\n \r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will cater to her family's needs, ensure her children's education, pay for her kitchen utensils and save some to meet the emergency needs of her family. She prefers loans from GHAPE because of low interest rates and convenient repayment intervals, and also because the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are disbursed. The social needs of members are also catered to at GHAPE.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1465636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy seedlings, fertilizer, sprayer and medicine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

She is only 22 years old and a housewife. She is the mother of three children; two sons and one daughter. They are 5 years old, 4 years old and 13 months old, respectively. Her husband is Kaodar, 22 years old. Momina passed Class V (Grade 5) and her husband passed Class VII (Grade 7). They live in the small village of Kholai in the small town of Dhupguri, in the district of Jalpaiguri, in their own Kachha house (mud and straw made). \r\n\r\nHer husband is engaged in agriculture. It is the main source of income with which they meet the household necessities. They have their own small piece of land. Some of this land they have purchased, some they have inherited from their parents. But the income from the cultivation is not sufficient to run such a big family now -a-days.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a loan from BJS to start a business cultivating tomatoes.

Here he began studying agriculture and learned from his relatives how to grow vegetables. Every year, his business grows and now he has several greenhouses already.   \r\n\r\nLast year, Lyova used a Kiva loan to install a heating system. That being said, he understood that for his quantity of greenhouses he would need a more powerful heater. Lyova is requesting a loan in the amount of 30,000 hryvnia to buy a more powerful boiler heater for his greenhouses. This will help him to plant his seedlings earlier and sell his harvest for a better price. \r\n\r\nLyova has a big family with four children. Now two of his daughters are of marrying age, which is why he is trying with all of his strength and finances to invest in his business in order to help his children start their own, individual lives.

many years already, Igor has been in the business of growing determinant tomatoes and cucumbers, as well as growing seedlings for sale. At first, Igor and his friends rented a car and transported their products to Russia. With the earned money, he bought land and built greenhouses. Now he doesn't have to travel as far, as customers come to meet him at his house. He has loyal customers. Over the last few years, Igor has gained a lot of experience. His crops are of an especially high quality and he takes pride in them.  \r\n \r\nHowever, this year, Igor has been unlucky. In Autumn of last year, he installed heating in all of his greenhouses. He made a big investment in this. In the Spring, when everything has been planted, it became apparent that he had bought poor-quality tubing. As a result, the first four clusters of tomatoes had been lost, and with them, his main source of profit. This is why Igor is for the first time applying for a loan. With the received loan, he plans to buy new tubes from a reputable manufacturer as well as buy a plastic cover and seeds. \"I am grateful for the opportunity to receive assistance for my business.\" Igor hopes to fix the heating system and receive a wonderful harvest this season.

She first got involved in this field working in a sewing shop that she ran with her mother-in-law. Unfortunately, her boyfriend -who was also the father of her first son- died tragically, and from that point, the relationship with her mother-in-law was never the same. Hence, they decided to split the business\u2019 capital and the equipment.\r\n\r\nThis is how Diana launched her own small sewing shop, which is the main source of income that allowed her to provide for her family and cover the household expenses.

They live in their own kaccha house (mud and straw-made).\r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is their agricultural activity. They have a plot of land where usually potatoes are grown.  Manju and her husband work hard and always have high quality potatoes, which are sold to local retailers. As the income is only seasonal, the earning is not sufficient to maintain their lifestyle and the expenses of their children's education. Manju needs to expand her existing business to give additional financial support to her family. So she has applied for this loan from BJS to buy potato seeds and fertilizers.\r\n\r\nManju also hopes her business will ensure that her family members and especially her children have a better education and a better future.

Yoreldis has had a business making and selling lunches for over ten years.  The business provides an income for the household.  Yoreldis learned this trade from her mother.  She also had a business like this but closed it due to family circumstances.\r\n\r\nTwo months after closing the business, Yoreldis and her sister asked around the neighbours to see if there was a need to reopen it.  Their response, and the responses of their first customers, were very positive.  The sisters have now been selling lunches and simple and special meals for four years.  They make the food to order.  Their customers are workers, who have jobs with carpenters, contractors, and in the neighbourhood.  Yoreldis and her sister buy the goods they need in the city market.  There they find the prices they need, which are very competitive. They buy in cash every day, working from 5am until 2pm.  Yoreldis' goal is to have their restaurant on premises separate from their home, so that the house will be more peaceful, and so that they can earn a lot more and pay for her children to study at university.  Yoreldis' biggest challenge is that she does not have enough working capital to achieve her dreams quickly.

Because of this, he knows his activity very well. Today he has the help of his life's companion.\r\n \r\nThe loan he has asked Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy materials to plant 7,000 square meters of plantains. With it, he will buy the seeds, pay for the soil preparation and for the fertilizer. If it isn't enough, he will pay for anything else he needs himself, because he has about 200 bunches of plantains that are almost ready to sell. This way, he thinks he will owe less and invest more and be filling the need of producing plantains. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's dream in the short term is to be able to build his own house when he gets the

cabeza de hogar. Durante toda su vida productiva se ha dedicado a trabajar como comerciante independiente, inici\u00f3 vendiendo diversos productos de manera ambulante en las calles de la ciudad, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 de una amiga que tambi\u00e9n realizaba esa labor. Hace 14 a\u00f1os, se le present\u00f3 la oportunidad de tomar un local en un pasaje comercial del centro de la ciudad que es muy reconocido por el amplio comercio de libros de todo tipo y, desde entonces comenz\u00f3 a vender estos productos, trabaja sola de lunes a s\u00e1bado de 8:00 am a 6:00 pm y as\u00ed genera los recursos suficientes para sustentar las necesidades de su familia, ya que toda la carga econ\u00f3mica recae sobre ella. Ella encuentra en su labor, la ventaja de no tener que rendir cuentas a otras personas y que puede manejar su propio tiempo, pero debe afrontar la desventaja de no tener los beneficios de las prestaciones sociales. Actualmente solicita el apoyo del cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de surtido al por mayor (libros acad\u00e9micos, de literatura, novelas, entre otros), as\u00ed podr\u00e1 abastecerse lo suficiente para satisfacer la demanda de fin de a\u00f1o y la de la temporada escolar del pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o, en la se incrementan sus ventas, generando mayor rentabilidad e ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Mar\u00eda manifiesta que su principal inter\u00e9s es poder cumplir el sue\u00f1o de tener su negocio en un local mejor ubicado, pues actualmente est\u00e1 en un segundo piso, por lo que en algunas ocasiones tiene inconvenientes para vender los libros; sin embargo ella sigue luchando incansablemente, pues aspira a ver sus hijos graduarse de la universidad y lograr que sean personas \u00edntegras y exitosas.","en":"Mar\u00eda is 39 years old. She is the single mother of 3 children and a head of household. During her productive life she has worked as an independent merchant. She started by selling different products as a street vendor in the city streets. She learned that activity from a friend who also did that kind of work. Fourteen years ago, the opportunity came up to have a locale in a hallway full of retailers in the city center. It is very well known for the sale of a wide variety of books of all types. She has been selling this type product since then. She only works Monday through Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and in this way she generates enough resources to fulfill her family's needs, since all of the financial responsibility is on her. In her works she finds that there is an advantage in not having to be accountable to other people  and that she can manage her own time. However, she faces the disadvantage that she doesn't have the benefits of social services. Right now, she is asking for the loan to invest in buying merchandise wholesale (textbooks, literature, novels and more) to stock up enough to fill the end of the year demand and the next school year. This is when her sales increase, generating more profits and income. Mar\u00eda says that her main interest is being able to make her dream come true of having her business in a better locale, because right now she is on the second floor. Sometimes that is inconvenient for selling books. Nonetheless, she keeps fighting tirelessly because she aspires to seeing her children graduate from college and become honest and successful people.

Two of their two sons are receiving an education.  They read in class IX (Grade 9) and class VI (Grade 6).  Their only daughter is still a child below school-going age.\r\n\r\nThey have their own kachha house( straw and mud-made) at Barosoria in the small town of Dhupguri in the district Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nThey are from a humble family of scarce economic resources, which is why Rabia's husband cultivates different crops in their own small piece of land.  He has been working in agriculture for many years and produces beans, onions and other vegetables for the family's consumption and sells some of his produce in the local markets.\r\n\r\nThe small income of Rabia's husband is not sufficient to get past the financial hurdles of their family, so she decided to start cultivating potatoes in their land. For this she needs capital, which they do not have, so she applied for this loan from BJS for purchasing potato seeds and fertilizers.  She hopes the profit which will be generated from their new business will meet the financial needs of their family as well as helping her to give her children better education.\r\n\r\nRabia hopes to upgrade their kachha house to a pacca one (made of concrete) in future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1479271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase good quality potato seeds and fertilizers for cultivating potatoes.
