For the last five years, Ana has managed a restaurant, with the goal of improving the well being of her son, who needs more care as he gets older.  Usually she begins working at 6 AM to prepare breakfast which she sell until 9 AM.  At that hour, she begins working on lunch which will be served at 2 PM.  A few hours later she begins working on dinner which will begin at around 7 or 8 PM depending on how sales are going.  The most difficult part of the work is that clients demand a lot of her time and attention, but overall Ana likes her job and that compensates for any inconvenience.  She is working with the well being of her son, who is the light of her life, in mind and would like to give him a brighter future.  With the money from this loan, she will buy new furniture for the restaurant to better attend to her clientele, expand her business, and improve her income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kahn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":213991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying new furniture to improve the comfort of her restaurant for customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-15T18:40:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-29T21:16:58Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336159},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957418},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227668},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422903},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":217.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116127},{"amount":70.85,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":217.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011087}],"funded_date":"2008-10-15T21:16:58Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kahn","image":986682}},{"id":73830,"name":"Joan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joan S. is a Tanzanian woman and SELFINA client who is 36 years old.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

He lives with his wife and a son. For more than 6 years, he has been involved in agricultural activities. He hires workers to work the land and gets help from his family with handling the money produced from the sales. \r\n\r\nLately, Abdujalil has expanded into raising livestock, which he also sells. He buys young cattle and cows, and when they are grown and heavy, he sells them. This is the first time that Abdujalil has requested a loan from IMON International. He has good references from his neighbors who consider him a responsible person. He requests this amount to buy seeds and fertilizer to grow wheat and onions on his land.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a nephew who lives with her and helps her, and she has accepted the responsibility of sending him to school. Her most cherished dream is have her business earn enough so that she will be able to afford to send her nephew to college.\r\n<p>\r\nEmilia has always had an entrepreneurial spirit and an independent outlook on life. She is willing to invest her time, effort and money in a business, when she is sure that she will profit from it. She started earning a living by putting up a small <i>carinderia<\/i>, or luncheonette, adjacent to her house to serve meals to the locals. It became so popular that she was inspired to expand her services and began to offer coffee and snacks between meal times. In 2002, she became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could have access to additional capital to expand her business because, as she explains, \"If you have a bigger investment [and] if you manage your business well, you will surely get a bigger return also.\"  Over time, Emilia has saved up and bought properties as an investment to secure her future.\r\n<p>\r\nAside from her luncheonette and cafeteria, Emilia earns additional income from two houses that she rents out. The smaller house is being rented by two students, while her bigger house is rented by a religious group. Emilia has been operating her carinderia and cafeteria for 32 years and she has been a landlord for only two. Her business nets her a profit of 4,000 pesos per month, which is enough for her living expenses, and she's been able to keep a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon for the seven years that she's been a member. Her previous loan of 19,500 pesos for her 11th loan was fully repaid on time without any delays in any of her weekly installments. \r\n<p>\r\nNow for her 12th loan cycle, Emilia is again borrowing 19,500 pesos to add to her working capital to ensure the sustainability of her business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":393673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The rest are older and live independently.  \r\n\r\nSince she was young, she has worked in agriculture and she currently grows potatoes, peas, and gladiolus flowers with her husband.  She says that farm work is tedious, because it is a constant watch on each plant so that a plague of insects doesn't harm their crops.  Julia knows that if given proper care and fertilizer, you can expect a good harvest.  Additionally, the experience she has with planting has allowed to her to learn the necessary techniques for harvesting the entire crop without problems.  She likes her work very much because she gets to work with her husband and together they work to plant and later sell everything to wholesale merchants in the city.  The sales give them a regular income that allow them to live comfortably with their daughter.\r\n\r\nSince she is a very hard-working woman, she plans to increase her gladiolus flower and pea production since the prices of those items are very good at the market.

He lives with his wife and one of his four children who helps him in his business. He has a carpentry shop in his house where he makes furniture in all varieties and styles, however the client likes. He also repairs furniture items that he finds in poor condition, making them look like they just came from the store. His wife and his son assist him in this and they are a great help to him. He has been working in carpentry and cabinetmaking for 15 years. He likes this profession because it allows him to have a tranquil life and to demonstrate his artistry and creativity.

SPBD's loans are Vagana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vagana Pilato are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She and her husband work on their small farm for the education of their 4 children.  She is dedicated to agriculture.  From girlhood, she has had two hectares of citrus plantations and 2 years ago she planted bananas also in two other hectares.  In the morning hours she prepares both breakfast and lunch, and thus gives herself time to go to buy merchandise for her small convenience store, where she is occupied in times when the small farm does not require as much attention.  What pleases her is harvest time for the bananas, which is every 15 days, since it is easy and does not take a lot of time.

The loan is for investment in her business like buying fabric, needles, and replacement parts for her sewing machine.\r\n\r\nOrbelina dreams of continuing this business because she depends upon its income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":260621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-05-27T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orbelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956939},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055669},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599855},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035744},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948142}],"funded_date":"2009-05-27T20:02:30Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:38:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":114822,"name":"\u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N. \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb (435970112) is a 39-year-old female living in the town of Kim \u0110\u1ed9ng.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Zam is an optimist; she prefers looking on the positive side of things even when circumstances are not in her favor. She says this has saved her soft drink business from running into the many stonewall challenges that often strike at the root of small businesses like hers. Fifteen years is the time she has been in this business.

The first business that Martha had was selling underclothes as an itinerant vendor, but 30 years ago, one of her friends taught her to make bed clothes, curtains, tablecloths, uniforms, skirts, blouses, pants, etc.  Now she has her own sewing workshop, which is located in the facilities of the San Francisco de As\u00eds Hospital in the same city where she lives.\r\n\r\nMartha is requesting this loan to buy a large quantity of raw materials like fabric, thread, lace, elastic, etc.  In this way, she will be able to offer her customers a variety of products at accessible prices.

After mixing, he pours the concrete into special metal forms and then dries slabs in a natural way. Now Gevorg is asking for a 720,000 Armenian dram (AMD) loan to buy a dryer for the slabs, which will allow him to shorten the period of production time.

","en":"Catalina is from a town rich in culture.  The archeological sites near her house are well known and there's also a butterfly sanctuary.  Cata, as she is know, is 35 years old.  She left school after the sixth grade because her family didn't have enough money for her to continue.  Dona Cata has operated a business buying and selling snacks and other merchandise for 6 years.  She is applying to Fundacion Realidad for a loan so that she can stock the business with merchandise that she will resell: fried snacks, instant soups, coffee, tea, soft drinks, juices, etc.  She wants to add a few grocery items because she wants to start a grocery business in the future.  She also has a few video games for the neighborhood kids.  She says that she decided to start the business to help her husband with household expenses.  She also wanted to do something that would make her feel useful.  She buys her stock from various stores in Zitacuaro.

With the money she is requesting, she will buy citrus seedlings and will hire field workers to clear the brush from her field so she can plant more crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":224260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of citrus seedlings and to hire field workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-24T04:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":850.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594879}],"funded_date":"2008-11-24T10:24:54Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geoffrey and Susan Gall","image":107956}},{"id":77974,"name":"Chan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chan C., 43, is the mother of four children.

She has been in business for such a long time thanks to the fine quality of her work. It could sometimes take her up to a whole month to finish embroidering, depending on how complicated the designs are. Rosalina makes clothing for her community\u2019s traditional festivities in which women wear skirts and shawls with bright and colorful embroidery. For Rosalina, this line of work is a form of entertainment. It has allowed her to care for her children, who are now mostly all adults and are very grateful to their mother for always protecting them and providing them with an education. In the future, Rosalina would like to stay in the embroidery business because it does not require great physical exertion. This is the second time she requests a loan from MFP, and she is committed to work for her microfinance institute\u2019s well-being.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store and by pig fattening.\r\n\r\nJudith\u2019s husband, Renato, helps run the businesses. They have five children who are between 15 and 31 years of age. One of her children is currently going to school and helps in the business. Judith joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,400 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJudith is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and pig fattening businesses, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 17th loan in the amount of PHP 18,000, which she intends to use in her general store and pig fattening business.  Judith is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":478980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Since he enjoys producing a quality product, Elmer receives technical assistance from government institutions who invest in his hard work so that he will be equipped to process the coffee beans and achieve a better quality product.  \r\n<p>\r\nElmer and his wife have reached an agreement to use the earnings from their grocery store to cover the household expenses.  This will allow them to save their income from farming to purchase a house in the city where they will open another store.  They will also buy a car for transporting passengers and hauling their produce to the markets.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  As he gets to know the members of his Communal Bank, Elmer is happy to be part of an integrated and responsible group.  With this loan of 1000 PEN, he will hire workers to help with harvesting his coffee.  He will also buy bags and baskets to help with gathering of the coffee.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":507591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Hire workers to harvest coffee & purchase bags and baskets for collecting coffee beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1057.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153905}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T02:02:33Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":189440,"name":"Luciana Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco comunal LUCIANA, en su Secuencia 2, est\u00e1 formado por 10 clientes, todas mujeres, la mayor\u00eda D. las socias pertenecen a la Zona D.

She owns a business venture, planting and harvesting taamu for sale. (Ta'amu in Samoa is cooked and eaten as a root vegetable like taro.)  She has many years of experience in this business.  Epenesa needs a loan of 1,000 WST to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or $146 per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Epenesa joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Epenesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She is a farmer from Tursunzade in Tajikistan. Growing up in this mostly agricultural region, she has learned many important things related to farming. She owns a greenhouse and grows different kinds of vegetables and has been in this business for 20 years. Yulduzkhon is seeking a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer. She believes this loan will help her improve conditions in her greenhouses thus ensuring richer harvests and a higher income. \r\n \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, as a key post along the Silk Road and site of the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only seven per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

her family.\r\n\r\nShe hopes the loan will be approved because she is a woman alone who has struggled constantly all these years to support her children in a proper home within her limited economic capacity.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

muri\u00f3 siendo a\u00fan ni\u00f1a, con sus hermanas vio a su madre enfrentar con responsabilidad este reto de educarlas como personas de bien.  Ella desde que estaba en el bachillerato practic\u00f3 el h\u00e1bito del ahorro, pues con el poco dinero que su mama le daba para la merienda, lograba  juntarlo  para comprar productos que luego vend\u00eda  entre sus compa\u00f1eras de clase y obten\u00eda su utilidad, pr\u00e1ctica que hoy tambi\u00e9n realiza  y que le permiti\u00f3 iniciar y sostener  el  negocio de vender mercanc\u00eda variada;  ella comenta que  con lo que le da su esposo para cubrir los gastos del hogar  ella ahorra y esta es justamente la base de su capital de trabajo que ha fortalecido la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo , mediante cr\u00e9ditos y ya tiene alrededor de 7 a\u00f1os de estar vinculada  a esta organizaci\u00f3n. El negocio de Mary Luz consiste en conseguirle a sus clientes las mercanc\u00edas que ellos necesiten en la l\u00ednea de jabones, cremas dentales, papel higi\u00e9nico, adornos, accesorios, papeler\u00eda  que exhibe en una peque\u00f1a vitrina y  que vende de contado y  de otras mercanc\u00edas como cosm\u00e9ticos, ropa que suele  d\u00e1rsela a sus clientes para que le paguen a plazos de acuerdo al plan concertado. Mary Luz prefiere clientes que trabajen en empresas, para no tener dificultades con la recuperaci\u00f3n de su dinero, porque dice  que \u201csi una persona no trabaja no tiene de donde sacar para pagarle\u201d. Desde que inici\u00f3 en la Fundaci\u00f3n su capital de trabajo se ha incrementado y el beneficio de la utilidad de su negocio se refleja en que ha mejorado su vivienda, que  antes estaba en proceso de construcci\u00f3n y ahora ya luce muy adecuada, de igual manera ha comprado un computador para que sus ni\u00f1os estudien y est\u00e1 validando el bachillerato, mientras su esposo trabaja en un restaurante, para sacar entre los dos adelante a su familia. Mary Luz cuenta que tiene una hermana que la acompa\u00f1a en todos las innovaciones que le  hace a su negocio, pues ella tiene una capacidad creativa maravillosa para envolver regalos, hacer arreglos acordes a cada situaci\u00f3n  y la ha ayudado, como cuando Mary Luz se invent\u00f3 vender a los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1as sorpresas que incluyeron premios y les dej\u00f2 este negocio una  muy buena utilidad.  En la actualidad Mary solicita un cr\u00e9dito a la Fundaci\u00f3n para comprar mercanc\u00eda variada y prepararse para venderla el d\u00eda del amor y de la amistad, porque quiere en su negocio exhibir peque\u00f1os detalles bien empacados, que llamen la atenci\u00f3n : Cosm\u00e9ticos, cuadernillos, cintas, papel de regalo, adornos, ganchos y accesorios.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Mary es hacer de su negocio un gran almac\u00e9n, donde pueda atender m\u00e1s efectivamente a sus hijos de 3, 8, 10 y 11 a\u00f1os de edad,  desde su hogar y no salir tanto donde sus clientes;  y este es justamente su gran desaf\u00edo, porque tiene muchos afanes generados por la forma de desarrollar su negocio, pero quiere seguir siendo independiente y construir junto a  su esposo una familia exitosa de la mano de Dios.\n\n","en":"Marly Luz O. is a very responsible person.  This is because her father died when she was still a girl; she and her sisters saw how her mother responsibly faced the goal of teaching them to be good people.\r\n\r\nEver since she was in high school she has practiced the habit of saving.  She got together the little bit of money her mother gave her for a snack and bought products that she later sold to her classmates.  She got a profit, and she continues to do so now.  This allowed her to start and sustain her business of selling varied merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she saves from what her husband gives her to cover the household expenses.  This is indeed the base of her working capital, which the Funcaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has strengthened through loans.  She has been involved with this organization for around seven years.\r\n\r\nMary Luz\u2019s business consists of getting her customers the merchandise they need like soap, toothpaste, toilet paper, decorations, accessories, and stationery that she displays in a small showcase.  She sells these products for cash.  The other merchandise like cosmetics and clothes she usually gives to her customers, and they make payments according to the agreed upon plan.\r\n\r\nMary Luz prefers customers who work in companies so that she does not have difficulties recovering her money.  She says, \u201cIf a person does not work, they do not have the means to pay her\u201d.  Since she started in the Fundaci\u00f3n her working capital has increased, and the beneficial profit from her business is reflected in the improvements made to her house.  \r\n\r\nThe house was previously under construction, and now it looks good.  In the same fashion she has bought a computer for her children to use in their education, and she is pursuing a high school degree.  Her husband works in a restaurant so that between the two of them they can get their family ahead.\r\n\r\nMary Luz says that she has a sister who joins her in all of the innovations she makes to her business.  She has a marvelous creative capacity to wrap presents and make arrangements for each situation.  She helps her.  For instance, when Mary Luz came up with the idea of selling surprises that included prizes for small children, it made this business very profitable.\r\n\r\nMary is currently requesting a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n to buy varied merchandise to sell for Valentine\u2019s Day.  She wants her business to display small items with good packaging, which will call attention to them.  She will buy things like cosmetics, small notebooks, ribbons, wrapping paper, decorations, clips, and accessories.  \r\n\r\nMary\u2019s dream is to make her business a great store.  Then she would be able to take care of her children more effectively at home and not have to leave so much to see her customers.  Her children are 3, 8, 10, and 11 years old.  That is precisely her great challenge.  She is very eager to develop her business.  However, she wants to continue being independent.  Together with her husband she also wants to build a successful family in Gods\u2019 hands.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Luz is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offerings. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Luz from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":574786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase new items to expand product offerings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

Dulbar thinks it's possible to get a quality education in Tajikistan, and at a lower cost than abroad, but her son has plans to eventually transfer to another university all the same.  The university he's currently applying to will select among on-site students from both secondary as well as other post-secondary schools on a competitive basis.  Her son feels that this loan will make the process easier for him, and gives his thanks to Kiva for their help and for the big role they'll play in his life.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1705211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay for university","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"kostakos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dulbar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":269.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":285.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":295.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":310.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":310.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":308.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":329.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":352.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":363.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":365.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.29},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.29},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.6},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":825227,"name":"Fancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello world!

With your loan, Fancy will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money.

In the future, she hopes to increase her sales and purchase a personal meat grinder. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian to English by Anna Startseva, Kiva Volunteer<p><b>\r\n\u0418\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0445\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u2013 39 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0443\u0436 \u0443\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0420\u0424, \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435.  \u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0443\u0436\u0435 6 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0444\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430. <p>\r\n\u041a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u041c\u0417\u0424 \u00ab\u041c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u00bb \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 2004\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0438 \u0435\u0451 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u043b\u0438 70$. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c  \u043e\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e,  \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0451 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u043e 300$.  \u0412 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438  \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0443."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":55135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase her sales and purchase a meat grinder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2007-08-26T07:05:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-09T16:18:15Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2007-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2007-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2007-09-26T09:22:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58948},{"amount":69,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2007-10-26T09:23:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72265},{"amount":69,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T10:22:56Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86990},{"amount":68,"local_amount":68,"processed_date":"2007-12-26T10:18:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103060}],"funded_date":"2007-08-26T16:18:15Z","paid_date":"2007-12-26T10:18:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":20638,"name":"Heab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Heab T., age 41, sells fruit in the market, earning about $4.75 per day in revenue.
