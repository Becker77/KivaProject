He has a very optimistic outlook on life, is always in a good mood, and is a good family man.  His family is very warm and welcoming.  Alexander is an excellent businessman.  He never just sits around, rather he works constantly.  Over the last 20 years, he has been able to build up a large farm and he has many highly productive greenhouses.  He raises early vegetables like radish, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and he reaps three harvests a year.\r\n\r\nBecause it was cold this year, the autumn harvest was unsuccessful and he earned less than usual.  And so, Alexander has decided to apply for a loan.  With the 40,000 hryvni (UAH) he receives, he will buy plastic greenhouse film, seed, and a boiler for the greenhouses where he raises seedlings.  There isn't much time left since planting for the next season goes on in December and Alexander tries to have everything ready in advance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4875,"image":{"id":1482857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She was not able to continue in school because of a lack of money, as her parents did not have enough money for her to continue to study.  Also, she had to move to another town.  Her father died when she was 8 years old.  Upon his death, it fell to her to take over responsibility for her younger siblings.  In order to support them, she used to travel to other towns to sell vegetables and to buy them food.  After some years she found a partner, and now she has 4 children, all of whom are involved in agricultural activities for every harvest.  Her oldest child is 17 years old.  He only finished 6th grade because he didn't like to study, and so it was best for him to work the land with his father.  They also have a 16 year-old daughter who also left school after 6th grade.  She works on the domestic household chores.  Their third child is 14 years old.  Like their oldest, he did not enjoy school and so left after 5th grade to work in the fields.  Their youngest child is 10 years old and is attending a local school.  He is in the third grade.  \r\n\r\nJesus de Navidad has 1 manzana (about 1.5 acres) of land which she and her partner obtained through a lot of hard work, as they both also work on other farms.  Everyone in the family gets involved during the time that they harvest the coffee.  One challenge that she faces is that the price is falling in the market, and that the wholesalers will buy her coffee at a low price, even though she does all of the processing of the coffee.  \r\n\r\nJesus de Navidad's goal is to improve her crops so that she can get more income, improve her property, and be able to leave it to her children.  This way, even though they didn't want to continue with their education, they can work the land and build their own homes.  She is requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies, because she has land to cultivate, and this way she can generate the income she hopes for in order to accomplish her goals and dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1480524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

This was very difficult to live through, but his son remained with him and was a excellent source of support.  Sergei is an excellent father and his son tries to emulate him in everything, and is in the very same business.  Together, they decided to develop their farming business.\r\n\r\nThis year Sergei and his son raised an excellent crop of tomatoes.  The tomatoes were very large and were notable for their quality.  Now, Sergei has decided to install a heating system in the greenhouses so they will be able to plant their seedlings earlier in the year.  For this reason he has applied for a loan.  With a loan of 25,000 hryvni (UAH), next year Sergei will be able to reap the harvest earlier and to sell it for a higher price."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":1482862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase and install a heating system for his greenhouses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":942.96,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergei","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2107.04,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25086.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":942.96,"payment_id":517560710}],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T17:09:54Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T12:39:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":640704,"name":"Maen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maen is 25 years old.

She lives with her husband and son in the department of Solol\u00e1.  She dreams of getting her family ahead.  Currently she earns her living making traditional clothing in her house.  She chose this business because her mother taught it to her when she was young.  She's been doing it for 18 years now, and it has been quite productive in generating income and profits.  \r\n\r\nThis season she has noticed an increase in demand for traditional clothing because people in her community are attending end-of-year activities, so Elvia is seeking a loan for 8000GTQ to buy thread and woven fabrics that she'll use to make the clothing.  \r\n\r\nElvia's greatest dream is to use the business to increase profits so she can improve her family's economic

Znamenka. She and her husband have been running the business together for many years. They are very open, sociable people. They are respected and well know throughout the region, since they provide agricultural equipment parts to drivers from other towns. With their extensive experience, they know what part to send, so that the buyers will have everything they need. Recently Galina noticed that fewer agricultural parts were being bought, and car parts were in higher demand. In order to not lose customers, they decided to expand their inventory of car parts, using a loan of 21,000 hryvnia. The loan will really help Galina develop her business.

It took one and a half years for her to recover. Through all of this, Ludmila did not stop her much loved work.

She is married and the mother of a 10 year old child. During the last years she has had work experience, working in a restaurant which paid her only 2000 COP per hour. This wasn't sufficient to support her family's finances so she decided to quit her job. Four months ago she decided to open her own business. It is a store which offers accessories, paper products, ice-cream, and photocopy services. So she has managed to generate the economic resources necessary to help her husband to pay the family's expenses. <br \/><br \/>Her drive, perseverance and the spirit to get ahead motivated her to request her first loan with which she wants to buy stock wholesale (earrings, rings, necklaces, bracelets, notebooks, pencils, markers, paints, ice-cream, sweet sauces, biscuits, wafers, etc.). With this she can have her business well-stocked and satisfy the varied tastes and needs of her clientele, raising the level of her sales and increasing her revenues that she receives for her labor.<br \/><br \/>Lina says that with the help of this loan she can realize her dream of being independent. At the same time reach an economic stability to further strengthen her business and make it a strong source of income. So she can give her son a better future and education and share with those she loves a nigher quality of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1481473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock wholesale (earrings, rings, necklaces, bracelets, notebooks, pencils, markers, paints, ice-cream, sweet sauces, biscuits, wafers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barbosa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-01T22:50:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-30T22:50:24Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lina Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71396},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73372},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75403},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77490},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79635},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81839},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86433},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91284},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93811},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96407}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.95,"local_amount":144668,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":146399.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450585691},{"amount":39.64,"local_amount":75503,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":76406.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523747},{"amount":82,"local_amount":156199,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:00:09Z","rounded_local_amount":158068.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227424},{"amount":327.41,"local_amount":623630,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":631094.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855813}],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T00:04:04Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T14:39:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":639894,"name":"Sixta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sixta vive en la ciudad de Imperial, cada d\u00eda se levanta muy temprano para acudir a su centro de labores, ya que ella es obrera en un fundo agr\u00edcola de su ciudad, con lo cual es su \u00fanico ingreso para poder solventar los gastos de su familia ya que es madre de 2 peque\u00f1os de 12 y 7 a\u00f1os.\n\nSixta esta agradecida con los prestamistas kiva ya que gracias a la ayuda que le han brindado podr\u00e1 comprar materiales de construcci\u00f3n para poder realizar mejoras en su vivienda, y de esta manera poder mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia, as\u00ed ella seguir\u00e1 luchando para poder hacer realidad su gran sue\u00f1o:\u201d Terminar de construir su vivienda de material noble y poder darle una profesi\u00f3n a su familia\u201d.\n","en":"Sixta lives in the city of Imperial.

She completed school through the 3rd grade because she couldn't go on studying due to lack of financial support from her parents, who had scant resources. She is a young woman with many hopes of making something of herself. She is a clothes maker and, along with her husband who is a plant manager at a factory, she has a small micro-business using fabric to produce shirts, baby clothes, pants, overalls, vests, boxers, etc for all ages.    \r\n\r\nShe has been making clothes for more than 5 years, but has only been in business as a micro-business owner for 4 years.

Over the course of months, she saw the demand she was generating with the quality of her products and decided to launch her own business. She gives thanks to God for the results she has seen so far, seeing as today she doesn't just have 2 machines, but a whole variety with which she makes merchandise for sale at the local market to students, other stores, schools, and the general public.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to make her micro-business into a major business that is competitive at the national and international level, that is known for the quality, durability, and technique with which her products are made. As a mother, she also dreams of supporting her children and giving them the opportunity she never had to get an education, as today a university education is a requirement for social acceptance, getting a good job, gaining new knowledge and learning methods for growing a business, and in order to be competitive.   \r\n\r\nThis is why today she is taking out this loan to buy primary materials

He grows basic grains; corn, beans, and sorghum.  He also has a micro bus, which he works with making trips that people request.  Luis has principles and moral values that have made him a very well-known person in the area where he lives.\r\n\r\nHe lives with his family, which is comprised of his wife and their three children.  Two of the children go to elementary school at the community school center.  His oldest daughter attends the city university.  His wife devotes herself to the household chores.\r\n\r\nHe has 32 years of experience working in agriculture.  He says that he learned this from his father because during that time, this was his family\u2019s main source of income.  When he turned 23, he traveled to the United States.  He worked there for four years.  He then returned and got the micro bus, which is still working.\r\n\r\nThe loan that was granted will be used to buy a cow from good stock.  He says that he has a lot of free space.  One of his goals is to start raising livestock.  This way he will be increasing the income for his family.\r\n\r\nLuis\u2019s dreams and goals for the future are to have a farmyard of good quality cattle and to produce dairy products.  He also wants to buy another micro bus to transport more people.

For emigration reasons, she did not continue with her studies and worked selling toys and clothing for children.  She is married and her husband works as a farmer.  They have three children, two of whom attend school.\r\n\r\nShe has worked as a merchant for five years since she was not able to find a job due to the small amount of education she has.  When she was young, she went out to sell clothing with her mother, and realized that she could also earn a living that way, so she started doing that type of work.  Sonia has a stand in the center of town.  She works from 7:00am until 1:00pm from Monday to Sunday.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to purchase more merchandise (toys and children's clothing), since this is the time when there is a strong demand for the products she sells.  It is necessary to have enough merchandise and meet the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to have a business with strong products and a strong income.  Her dream is to give her children an education so that they can be professionals and have a better style of life, different than the one she has.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1482054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She completed all but one year of elementary school.  She attended school through the third grade but was not able to complete her primary school education because her parents did not have the financial resources.  She is married and along with her husband she grows coffee, as well as chayotes, oranges, plantains and bananas.  She has a large family made up of four children; a girl and three boys.  The children attend school.  Etelinda  has a lot of experience with agriculture since she was interested in learning about it from a very early age. With patience and care, her parents taught her the proper techniques for planting and the maintenance required to keep the plants healthy and clean.   As a producer, the only things she has to worry about is that her crops could be lost due to a freeze (weather factors), infestation, or sicknesses.  Competition is not a problem for the sale of her products because she has customers that have supported her for many years.  Her crops are located on the same property where her house is located, so she can care for and maintain her crops personally. Her plan for the future is to cultivate a better variety of coffee which would allow her to compete in the national and international market. Her dream for her business and her family is to increase production, as mentioned before, and for her children to complete their educations so they can become professionals with college degrees and have better opportunities in their lives. The loan she is requesting today is for the purchase of agricultural supplies that she will use to take care of her crops.  This will provide her with a good crop and better income to support her family and her home. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1482076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase agricultural supplies for her coffee plants.

She had always been a stay-at-home mom and depended on her husband economically, but once her children were grown and working themselves, she took the initiative to find an activity to earn her own income. In this way she began selling merchandise such as clothing, shoes, lotions and perfumes. The first products she sold were given to her by her oldest son who lives abroad, and bit-by-bit she invested her earnings from those products into more inventory for the business. Her clientele also grew: in addition to selling to her family members and neighbors, she also had clients in the businesses where her other children work. In this manner she generated sufficient income to cover her personal expenses and to help with household expenses. She ran this business for 8 years, but because she lacked working capital, her business was interrupted.\r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a loan to reactivate the business and purchase merchandise in bulk (blouses, jeans, shirts, tennis shoes and other shoes, perfumes, games, etc.) and to pay off the remaining balance of a current loan. This will allow her to have a wide variety of merchandise to satisfy the demand which grows in the month of December. Her advantage is that she sells the name brand products her clients like, which increases her level of earnings. Bernarda, with her perseverance, charisma and good energy hopes to continue working in her business and continue receiving income to spend as she likes. She would also like to buy an apartment in a good location to spend her old age comfortably, at the side of her husband and her sons."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":1482175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She attended school through the ninth grade but due to her family's financial situation she cold not continue.  She is in a relationship and her partner works as a driver at a business.  Her daughter is two years old, and does not yet attend school due to her age. \r\n\r\nShe sells fruit and vegetables on foot, with a guacal (gourd bowl) on her head.  She has done this type of work for 11 years and learned it from her mother, who also does the same work.  Edith sells in the cantons near her home.  She leaves at 4am to buy produce, as this is the hour when the fruit and vegetables are freshest.  She also helps her father who works in agriculture.  He plants corn and maize.  She has a time she starts work, but she doesn't have a fixed time when she finishes. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to purchase fruit and vegetables, with the goal of increasing her income.  This will allow her to purchase more merchandise.  Even though she will have to work more, she is sure she will obtain better income. \r\n\r\nIn the future she sees herself with a fixed stall in the market, so she doesn't have to walk through the streets selling.  She hopes that her daughter does not suffer the way she did.  With the loans she can achieve the momentum that she needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1482115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase fruit and vegetables.

Nevertheless, she is optimistic and sure she will have an excellent coffee crop.\r\n\r\nShe needs a loan to purchase agricultural supplies to support her coffee crop, such as fertilizers and leaf fertilizers.  She dreams of growing her plot; planting and cultivating new coffee plants is the only way to secure the future for her family and her daily financial situation is precarious.  She is also teaching her children to work so that they are good people and value the hard work that she does in order to get by and have a decent life.

She is married, and she has only completed three years of primary education. It was because of her family's poor economic status that she could not continue studying.\r\n\r\nEnma is the mother of two children who live in separate homes, and who help her occasionally with her coffee crops, cutting and harvesting the beans. Enma has a lot of experience in the cultivation of coffee because she learned at a very early age from her parents, and she has been performing this trade with her husband for more than 28 years. \r\n\r\nShe also does other things to generate income for her family such as selling cow's milk as well as dairy products.  The land that she cultivates was given to her by her parents, and it is located three kilometers from her home, which she can reach walking, sometimes dressed for her work fertilizing and cleaning the crops.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband are the only ones involved in this business, and they pay for labor because they don't have enough strength to do it by themselves. Enma hopes to have an excellent harvest because this is what the economy of her home depends on -- selling the output to the intermediaries who come to her town and the different stores in the area. \r\n\r\nThis is why she needs financing to purchase fertilizers, liquid plant food, and labor that will be able to support her coffee cultivation and generate more income. Enma will also be able to reach her goals of continuing to expand her coffee crops, improve her home because it needs maintenance, and to keep strengthening her heritage for her children, grandchildren, and further generations. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1482137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy agricultural supplies to support her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T03:10:04Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1425,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":29240.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504237068}],"funded_date":"2013-12-13T17:58:16Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:05:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Estrada","image":null}},{"id":640338,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase agricultural products to help with her coffee crops.

She and her family have lived in the Barrio la Castellana for five years. This sector is well-traveled, which is why her business has grown in this short time.\r\n\r\nRamona is applying for credit to invest in the repair of the roof of her home and in the purchase of chairs and table to furnish her business and offer better service to her customers.

She is the mother of four children; one child is too young and fully dependent upon their mother. \r\n\r\nHer husband owns a clothing business and his practice is to buy fabrics from wholesalers and sell it to the retailers. He has lot of customers who like to buy fabrics from him. Sometimes he purchases fabrics from out of the city to minimize the cost and sells it to the retailers. He has good reputation in the market and his current customers refer him to the other retailers as well. As a result, new customer demand is increasing day by day but he does not have sufficient funds to buy more fabrics.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Shagufta requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband would be able to buy more fabrics to fulfill the demand.\r\nShe is in her third loan cycle and has shown an excellent repayment behavior. She has already been taking the loan from BRAC and investing in the business. She hopes that the savings will much increase and she will complete the remaining construction of her house. Her dreams are for the bright future of her children, establishment of her business, and better living standards for her family.

Nowadays due to household expenses, he does not have the amount to buy scrap goods, and does not have scrap to sell to get money.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Parveen requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy scrap goods, establish his enterprise, and make some savings to meet sudden needs or incidents.\r\n \r\nShe is very impressed with this honorable support, and shows her wish to take more loans after the payment of this loan. She thanks Kiva and it's field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1483168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy scrap goods for resale.

Because of this, he is unable to generate any income. He wants to repair the rickshaw as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Ishrat has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

He has worked with Arvand for more than two years. Askarjon's first loan was used to renovate his house. In April, Askarjon's seasonal work begins. He makes bricks, which requires a lot of physical strength. His wife does not work. She is a housewife and takes care of the children. To make an income sufficient to meet his family's needs, Askarjon works a second job. He works in animal husbandry. He raises and sells cattle. Now he is just starting this business and hopes that it will help him to improve his family's economic situation. Therefore Askarjon approached Arvand for a loan to buy a few head of cattle. He thanks Arvand in advanced for the financial support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1467635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Therefore, Qobiljon has his own business that brings him an income.  Qobiljon's children are in school, and he also needs money to provide his children with everything they need to study.  Thus, in order to have a good and stable income for living Qobiljon is engaged in his own business.  For several years he worked as a taxi driver.  He has this own passenger car, but he has been operating this vehicle for a long time and he had to fix it many times.  \n\nNow he is planning to buy a new and better car to maintain and expand his business.

","en":"Mahmadsafar, age 32, sells wooden windows and doors.  He lives and works in the Gissar district of Tajikistan and has his own shop.  His business is doing well and brings a good income.  Mahmadsafar has been involved in this business for the past five years, and his job allows him to support his family -- his wife and his two young children.  \r\n\r\nMahmadsafar and his family used to live in his parents' house, where several families also lived.  Thanks to his job, Mahmadsafar was able to build his own house in which he recently moved with his wife and children.  Mahmadsafar's business means a lot to him, and he would like to expand it.  However, he doesn't have enough money to do so.  For this reason, he is taking a loan to bring new merchandise in and increase his sales.  This loan is very important to him.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mahmadsafar plans to open his own workshop and get involved in the production of wooden and plastic windows and doors.  MLO Humo and Partners wish him success in his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n

Here is her story.\n\"My name is Farangees. I have graduated a high school in Khorog, Tajikistan this year and enrolled the American University of Central Asia.\nI would like to describe how active am I in the social life. I love being involved in different extracurricular activities. I volunteer in my school and in the Youth Center of Khorog. My responsibilities both at school and the Youth Center are the same: I teach Math and English language. At school I teach to younger students, but as for the Youth Center, there are students of different ages attending my classes. Before applying to the American University of Central Asia, I have conducted a small research and interviews with the currently enrolled students, trying to identify the amounts of funds required for studying at AUCA and living in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. I leave in the family of 7, including myself. I am the eldest child in the family, meaning that I bear the responsibility to support my younger sister and brother and my parents now, when I already grew up. Therefore my family is not able to afford full tuition fees at AUCA. I need KIVA loan to ensure that I will not have to think about finance while I pursue my degree. I think it is worth mentioning that from the very beginning, when I just heard about the American University of Central Asia, I started thinking of studying there, as lots of people study there from all over Central Asian region, and it is one of the best Universities in the region. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to all the students one of which is Kiva loan. The loan helps students to cover their tuition fees, which is a great help to those students who cannot afford paying the fees fully.\"\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1476585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She plans to sell the surplus and pay school fees for her children. She also plans to join a saving and loaning scheme to save some of the money obtained from selling the surplus. This will give her more financial independence and help her absorb financial shocks in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1476680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is single: she and her husband separated 16 years ago and each followed different paths. She kept her four children and has been fighting since then to support them. Currently only two of her children live with her, as the other two have their own homes. \r\n\r\nShe works selling fish in the canton where she is from. She has been doing this work since she was very young; her mother taught it to her. She also has another job taking care of a young boy in the house of a neighbor who lives in the same community as she does. To do this work she travels about five kilometers each day, and one of her daughters takes charge of selling in the business.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy more fish, because she wants to open a stall in the community market so she doesn't have to travel so far from her home to sell it. The loan will improve her life, as she will be able to avoid going so far and exposing herself to crime and other dangers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own business and to build her house in one place, from a better material, as it is currently of mixed materials.

This group consists of 9 women who have worked for 8 years as an organised group in Fray Casiano, an area of great poverty in Puntarenas, in the central Pacific region of  Costa Rica. They have shown a good understanding of the concepts of group work: solidarity, saving, as well as coordinating activities to generate funds. They have clear rules on the work. The women have asked for loans and understand the working of the group model. They have a board of directors and the documents were prepared to request this third loan, to have one new companion join who had participated in the first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, as well as have one woman leave who took part in the former loan with the communal bank Mujer Emprendedoras. Their hard work and effort has allowed each of them to be better street merchants; this fact was evidenced during a visit with each one of the members.<br \/><br \/>Yesenia is a member of the group and she will invest her loan in buying sandals, clothes, beauty products and general merchandise, thus increasing her inventory and meeting orders placed during Christmas and New Year, which is a great opportunity for sales. In addition, these women sell food and raffles, which allows them to increase their saving and support their family with the household costs and with their children's education, since the majority of the members are single mothers and heads of their household, and their economic support is very important to their own quality of life as well as to that of their sons and daughters.<br \/><br \/>Yesenia is a tenacious woman and, thanks to the internal organisation of the group, she manages the weekly repayments which allows them more leeway to obtain money for repaying the loan. She is the president of the group and they consider her a good leader and hope to get this loan in order to continue growing daily. They are hard-working women who have managed to succeed and improve their families' incomes by means of this group. They support their children's studies and support their partners with the family costs. They have managed to make their presence felt in the area where they live and are known for their weekend activities, when they sell food in the community. This gives work to others (mainly family members) through the preparation of these dishes which are typical of the coastal area of Costa Rica. They include vigor\u00f3n (boiled yuca or cassava mixed with crunchy pork rinds and covered with a spicy cabbage coleslaw). traditional pig soup, shellfish and tamales, which is a sort of steam-cooked corn dough and often served at Christmas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6950,"image":{"id":1479458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

","en":"Erika is a farmer who has been working off the land since she was young, having been taught by her parents. Thanks to this, she now owns dairy cattle whose products she sells, be it milk or curds and cheese. This generates enough of an income to support her family, comprised of her husband and her two children who she has brought up with effort and dedication. \r\n\r\nErika is currently requesting a loan to buy a dairy cow which is being sold at a good price. With this purchase she can increase her yield to 50 litres of milk daily, which would give her the opportunity to sell more products and receive a greater income for her family. With her drive and perseverance Erika would like to keep working hard to make every one of her dreams reality, such as acquiring more heads of dairy cattle to offer employment opportunities to other people in the region. For her this would make her business more profitable and ensure a more profitable and successful future for her children.

The challenge she faces is that during prolonged seasons of drought, there is less production.\r\n\r\nRose chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because of their good loan terms and better services, and they also improve the livelihood of small farm holders.

50 and married with four children. Three of them are married and live on their own, and her youngest son lives with his parents and works selling coal. Mastura has a high school education and raises animals and crops as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has four milk cows and 12 sheep that are well taken care of as well as a small parcel of land on which she grows hay, enough to harvest 600 bales in a season. She uses 300 of these bales for her own animals and sells the rest. Mastura's husband also helps a great deal with the business, monthly income from which is 5,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Mastura has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase a cow and a calf for fattening and resale. She plans to use profits from the loan for further augmentation of her herd, and for improvement of her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1483323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow and a calf for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chimgen village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.2,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mastura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":253.18,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":12543.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.07,"payment_id":459019731},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":12543.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749644},{"amount":255.82,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":12543.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.43,"payment_id":529946999},{"amount":239.55,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":12543.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.7,"payment_id":561578145}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T21:01:19Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":640840,"name":"Ngani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngani is a married woman with two children, both of whom are adults.

From a very young age he worked in farming, growing a variety of the most profitable products in the area such as organic cocoa, coffee, barbasco and other crops. Over time he was able to fulfil his objectives, one of which was to build his own house. After a few years he decided, on the recommendation of a family member, to make a living by buying produce and gradually this became his main business. He has been doing this for more than 10 years and this has enabled him to make good profits which have benefitted the household finances. \r\n\r\nLuciano says that working with barbasco requires a certain amount of care, since they are roots which will ultimately be used for insecticides and natural repellents. He really likes his work since he acts as a bridge between the growers who bring their produce to him, to an area he has set side at his home, and the big wholesale buyers in the region whom he sells to. This is how he makes his profits. \r\n\r\nThis is Luciano's second loan with Kiva and he is grateful for the financial support he is getting to make progress in life.

","en":"Gardenia is 45 years old. She is married to Hip\u00f3lito, and has three children. Thanks to their hard work they have their own home. Their 11-year-old daughter lives with them and goes to school, while their two sons are now grown up and independent.\r\n\r\nThe family lives in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, a very commercial and productive city. It is also well-known because the people of the Ts\u00e1chila ethnic group live in this region of Ecuador, and so it receives visits from Ecuadorian and international tourists who want to learn more about the Ts\u00e1chila culture. Gardenia's husband Hip\u00f3lito has worked for several years in the business of buying and selling scrap, and has been the household's main support. Little by little, with hard work they were able to help their children do well and become independent.\r\n\r\nGardenia too wanted to do something to improve their income, and so for the past three years she has worked selling cosmetics from catalogues. She is a very hard-working woman, and she has established customers who she visit every day.

She lives in a common-law marriage with her partner.  She moved to the city about two years ago looking for new opportunities to get ahead.\n\nIt has been difficult to find a job in a business, however, because she lacks work experience.  This motivated her to start her own business, a vegetable shop where she sells a variety of fruits and vegetables.  She also wants to start selling fried foods like empanadas, pastry, fried dough, and other things to supplement her income.  She hopes to support her husband with the financial responsibility of the household.\n\nHer drive and enterprising spirit lead her to request the support of the loan, with which she wants to buy shelves to store the produce, produce wholesale, shelving, and a tank of propane gas.  This way she can begin her work project, with which she hopes to be able to improve her family's living conditions.\n\nYaneri knows that to achieve her goals and get her business ahead she has to work with discipline, determination, and a lot of dedication.  This is the key to success and being able to keep on making progress toward realizing her dreams.  She especially dreams of having her own store, which will generate more profits for her so she can give her children a better future that is full of opportunities to advance and be honest and successful people.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1480868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

He was born in San Javier, which is located in the \u00d1uflo de Ch\u00e1vez province within the department of Santa Cruz in Bolivia.  He hopes to complete a network technology course \"CISCO CCNA\" at UPSA University.  He needs an educational loan in order to be able to pay for his studies.\r\n\r\nJaime has worked for two years in sales at an Information Systems business.  He lives with his parents and siblings and does not have another means of economic income.  His main motivation is becoming a better person and being able to help his parents economically in the future.  Jaime has always liked everything related to electronics, and so he is currently studying Electronic Engineering.  He wants to work in network development and therefore wants to complete this high-level technology course, which is also necessary to enhance and complement what he has already learned at the University.  He currently dedicates approximately four hours to studying and investigating interesting topics related to this profession.\r\n\r\nJaime hopes to expand his knowledge so that he can work in another area of the company, one that is more closely related to his career path and where he can develop his potential and skills.  He also hopes in the future to have his own business, which will make him feel that he is truly a professional.  \r\n\r\nHe does not think that there is something particularly special about himself that sets him apart to receive financing for his studies; he truly believes in equality among human beings, emphasizing that everyone has the same rights to education and to be treated with dignity by society.  He does feel very fortunate, since he has not had any huge setbacks in being able to study.  However, he already has a lot of university expenses, and the economic help he may receive will benefit him greatly in being able to complete one of his personal aspirations as a student.\r\n\r\nJaime is very grateful to the people that want to help others by giving them the opportunity to continue studying.  He says that he would like to \"help other people to reach their dreams,\" and he admires the generosity and good of others."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1472235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

lives in Totolapan Morelos with her husband, Alejandro, and their two children, Canaldo and Sergio.

Alejandro works in the fields and since it is only him and the boys, he rents the land that he is not able to farm on.  Alejandra bought a piece of land 15 years ago before meeting Alejandro.  Once they started living together they started building and expanding the house little by little.  But with the kids and their strenuous work this has been slower than they planned for.  Today, the family lives in a two bedroom house with a living room and what they started building as a kitchen.  \n\nAlejandro and Alejandra make around $700 USD a month through informal jobs, so accessing credit is impossible for them. For the last three months they have been saving to finish building the kitchen with a proper roof that will protect the stove that they bought after saving for quite some time.  Alejandra needs this loan to finish paying for the construction materials.  A proper roof and walls for the kitchen will protect their investment in the stove and will give the family a clean place where they can cook and eat.  The family will receive supervision visits from certified technicians to monitor the quality and progress of the construction.  The new construction will give this family the home they have been dreaming of for so long.
