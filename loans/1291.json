She used to live by the river El Tamarindo, but the hurricane Mith destroyed her house and a new one was built for her and her two children in this community. Her life has been difficult being a single mother. She spent many years working in Costa Rica to save money and buy what she owns today, and to open her business to support her family.

Leticia works as an assistant in the kitchen of a tourist center nearby.  Her working hours are long, and she balances this work with cooking and other household chores.  Leticia lives with her husband Jesus, a construction worker, and their two children. \n\nEach time they have to use the restroom they have to walk a couple of blocks to the community facility.  To avoid this inconvenience when showering, they simply use a bucket and cup at their house.  The family has been living here for the last 5 years, working hard to save and continuously improve their house.  When they first moved into their house the family bought kitchen appliances, but they have been using and storing them on their front porch because they have no space inside the house.  \n\nSince Leticia and Jesus do not have formal jobs and their income is low and variable, around $800 USD a month, neither of them has access to credit from banks or other organizations.  Leticia has been saving for the last three months to finish building the kitchen and a bathroom for the family.  She is now asking for a loan to complete the payment for required building materials.  The family will receive supervision visits from certified technicians to monitor the quality and progress of the construction.  \n\nThe kitchen will provide a healthy space for the family to cook and eat and the bathroom will give a healthier way of life and privacy to the family.  Leticia and Jesus want to make sure they take the right steps to give better opportunities to their children, and support them as they work their way through school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1481254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to pay for materials to build a kitchen and a bathroom","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Totolapan, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":301,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1017.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1043.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1069.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1095.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1151.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.27,"local_amount":1017.57,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1026.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439722343},{"amount":80.24,"local_amount":1043.02,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1051.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449628389},{"amount":82.23,"local_amount":1069.09,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1078.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459095186},{"amount":84.3,"local_amount":1095.82,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1105.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467910098},{"amount":86.4,"local_amount":1123.21,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-27T08:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479130918},{"amount":88.56,"local_amount":1151.29,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-01T09:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1161.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490824813}],"funded_date":"2013-12-08T14:19:37Z","paid_date":"2014-07-01T09:33:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":639754,"name":"Melissa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Melissa es una joven emprendedora de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, estudiante de universidad y dedicada a la venta de mercanc\u00eda importada desde hace aproximadamente un a\u00f1o.

But now, she sees her kids bathing with a bucket every morning and having to use a latrine which is not very sanitary. \n\nFelix and Josefina have been saving for some time to make the necessary additions to their home.  They know that a proper roof and a complete bathroom will not only make life more comfortable but also healthier.  They are asking for a loan to finish paying for the materials they need to build the bathroom and a cement roof instead of the tin roof they currently have. \n\nJosefina and Felix make around $600 USD a month, and they have no access to other types of credit.  The family will receive supervisory visits from certified technicians to monitor the quality and progress of the construction.  The new construction will give their children and the rest of the family more privacy and a healthier life.  The family looks forward to cooler summers and warmer winters.

Unfortunately she was not able to finish her schooling because she began work at a very young age so she could support her family. Marina separated from her husband many years ago and has had to care and provide for her three children alone. One son still lives with her but is now married. He works in construction and his daughter is eight months old but they and his wife do not depend on her because they are able to support each other together. \r\n\r\nMarina sells live chickens, an activity that she has carried for forty years. With this business she has gotten her children ahead and built her own home where she lives. This work has been a family business and due to the need to make a living for her family, she began to sell chickens, the only economic activity that she carries out. She travels to the country's capital twice a week. Her children help her occasionally. On days that she goes out to sell, she leaves at 5:00am and returns in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to buy more chickens because in these days her sales are increasing a little bit.

She is happy to help them and have them there every evening when they shower, but for the family this arrangement has become a little uncomfortable.  They also want to build a bedroom for Kevin since he is growing up very fast and may be joined by a sibling soon. \n\nZedei and Irving make around $600 USD a month.  Since they are both informally self employed, they have no way of showing their income and therefore have no access to formal credit.  With their loan they will receive all the building materials they need as well as technical assistance and supervision from certified technicians, who will monitor and supervise the construction work to make sure that all quality and safety standards are met.  \n\nZedei is excited to see her house and her dreams grow, but most of all, she is excited to build a beautiful house where Kevin and her future children will grow up."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1482283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to pay for materials to build a bathroom and a bedroom","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Totolapan, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":301,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T21:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T21:00:10Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zedei Bestabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1017.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1043.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1069.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1095.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1151.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.27,"local_amount":1017.57,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439722348},{"amount":80.24,"local_amount":1043.02,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449628394},{"amount":82.23,"local_amount":1069.09,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1075.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459095191},{"amount":84.3,"local_amount":1095.82,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1102.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467910103},{"amount":86.4,"local_amount":1123.21,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-28T08:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1129.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479130923},{"amount":88.56,"local_amount":1151.29,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-01T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1157.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490824816}],"funded_date":"2013-12-04T05:19:25Z","paid_date":"2014-07-01T09:33:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":640399,"name":"Manuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manuel works selling insoles for shoes.

Patricia works as a cleaner in a motel a couple of towns away.  She has long hours but says she would rather work there than in the field like her husband.  Patricia and Gregorio have worked really hard to have the house they live in.  However, their kids are growing, especially the two oldest Anastacia and Sara, and these girls need a bedroom of their own to replace the living room they currently sleep in. \n\nPatricia knows that the family can be protected against the cold weather in winter and hot temperatures in summer if they change their current tin roof to a proper cement roof.  This change will also help them keep the house in better condition and will improve the health of the family.  Patricia has been saving for the last three months to buy materials for the improvements she wants to make to house.  She is requesting a loan to finish paying for the materials. \n\nPatricia and Gregorio both have informal jobs and low incomes so many institutions will not give them credit.

He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase their production. With the profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Every afternoon, Rosa goes out with their son to sell what Julio Cesar grows in the field.  Their hard work earns them roughly $600 USD a month. \n\nJulio Cesar has worked hard over the years and has been able to build a home for his family.  However, their house is small even for the young family.  They all live, cook, eat and sleep in the same room.  Julio and Rosa know that more children will come soon and they need to expand before that happens.  The family has been saving for the last three months to add two additional bedrooms and one bathroom to this house.  This loan will help them pay for the materials needed to finish the construction and get expert supervision. \n\nJulio Cesar has no access to credit with other organizations because he has an informal job that does not pay much and has irregular cash flows.  The family will work together to build this addition to their home.  They will receive supervision visits from certified technicians to monitor the quality and progress of the construction, and to prevent them from losing all the time and money they have already invested.  In less than 3 months, Julio Cesar, Rosa and their child will be able to live in a better house with more space, that allows them to lead a healthier lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1481288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to build a bedroom and a bathroom","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Totolapan, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":301,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1017.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1043.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1069.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1095.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1151.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.27,"local_amount":1017.57,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1026.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439722340},{"amount":80.24,"local_amount":1043.02,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1051.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449628386},{"amount":82.23,"local_amount":1069.09,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1078.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459095183},{"amount":259.26,"local_amount":3370.32,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3399.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467910095}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T19:53:11Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T12:05:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":640943,"name":"Logo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Logo is a 50 year old married woman with four children.

He has been working there for over 35 years, first helping his father and now managing the business.  These days his wife Ema helps him with some tasks of the business.  Ema and Ciro have been married for a long time, and their children have flown the coop and now live with their own families.  \n\nWhen they first built their current home, there was no water or sewage service so the thought of a complete bathroom was never in their plans.  Thirty years later things have changed in Totolapan.  For some time now they have been thinking about adding a bathroom to the house.  They also want to add a living room now that their grandchildren and their own kids come to visit their home so often.  The area where the grandchildren currently play is near the couple's stove, which makes Ema nervous.\n\nEma and Ciro have no access to credit through traditional banking because of their income and their age.

","en":"Ariel, who is 50 years old, is married and the father of two children whom he has taken care of with sacrifice and dedication. During the last years of his employment, he worked for four years at a nationally-known producer of dairy products as a deliveryman. However, at that point they required that he replace his vehicle to continue working. Since he didn't have the resources to do it, he had to resign from the company. Soon after, he sold his truck; with the money he received and the little bit of on-the-job knowledge he had acquired as a driver, he opened his own auto mechanic's shop. For the seven years that he has been running this business, he has managed to generate the income he needs to pay for the basic needs of his household. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he is requesting the support of a loan; he hopes to buy work tools, a drill, and assorted replacement parts at wholesale (spark plugs, lights, rearview mirrors, axles, brakes, and other parts) and to pay off some outstanding debts. This will allow him to replace the tools that have gotten lost and improve the service he provides. With the necessary supplies and tools on hand, he will optimize his labor time and be able to serve a larger number of customers, thus generating additional income. Ariel hopes to keep working in that way to keep his business running, strengthen it, and grow it in order to generate greater income. With that extra income, he would like to open a parts shop alongside his workshop; this will supplement the money coming in to sustain his household and provide his family with a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1481301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

Turgunbuu has a higher education. She works as a teacher at a local school. Her husband does not work, but he helps on the farm. He prepares hay and feed for the winter for the livestock. To make additional income for her family, Turgunbuu works in animal husbandry and horticulture. She started twelve years ago when she bought livestock for 15,000 KGS. Because of Turgunbuu's hard work, her farm now has eight dairy cows, 31 sheep, and a small garden with apples and plums. Every year, Turgunbuu  and her children gather apples and plums and sell them at the local market. They do all of the work to care for the garden. Turgunbuu's husband trims and cares for the trees. They get a monthly income of 12,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Turgunbuu approached the microfinance bank Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy sheep for breeding. Turgunbuu plans to invest her profits into expanding her number of livestock, and plans to save enough money to buy a car. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1483368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Don-Kyshtak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T22:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T22:40:07Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turgunbuu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2771},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2740},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2810},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2883},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2957},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3034},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3112},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3193},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3275},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.73,"local_amount":2771,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2825.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942737},{"amount":57.08,"local_amount":2740,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2794.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449553270},{"amount":57.84,"local_amount":2810,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2865.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.7,"payment_id":459019732},{"amount":59.42,"local_amount":2883,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2940.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.65,"payment_id":467831057},{"amount":61.6,"local_amount":2957,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3015.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053490},{"amount":63.21,"local_amount":3034,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3094.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749645},{"amount":64.83,"local_amount":3112,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3173.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178365},{"amount":66.52,"local_amount":3193,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3256.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462972},{"amount":68.11,"local_amount":3275,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3339.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.12,"payment_id":529947000},{"amount":66,"local_amount":3225,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3288.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.19,"payment_id":542440338}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T09:26:23Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:24:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":640970,"name":"Khoeurn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khoeurn is 62 years old.

and works in Drogobych, Ukraine.  He is involved in the transportation of various goods.  He has been working in this field for three years already and has his own regular customers.\r\n\r\nHe is taking a loan of 5,000 Hryvnia in order to buy tires for his car, which he uses regularly.  He is not afraid of offering many services, but the regular orders he receives affect the condition of his car.  Because his car is now showing signs of wear and tear, he needs to repair it and change some of its parts.  Roman carefully monitors the condition of his vehicle, in order to keep his business going.\r\n\r\nRoman's dream is to make enough money to afford his own home.  In order to see his dream come true, he is ready to work even more, especially since he has a passion for his job.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1504079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy tires for the car he uses to transport goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Drogobych","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49.35 23.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-01-01T23:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T23:50:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":149.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":424}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104,"local_amount":832,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":856.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449652467},{"amount":49.71,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":428.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":459120735},{"amount":36.4,"local_amount":418,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":430.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.85,"payment_id":467936476},{"amount":40.02,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":428.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.98,"payment_id":479157309},{"amount":40.34,"local_amount":418,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":430.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.91,"payment_id":490851533},{"amount":72.28,"local_amount":836,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":860.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":32.22,"payment_id":517560728},{"amount":35.59,"local_amount":408,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":419.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.41,"payment_id":530043526},{"amount":36.54,"local_amount":418,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":430.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.71,"payment_id":542536315},{"amount":30.51,"local_amount":418,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":430.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.74,"payment_id":561669393},{"amount":30.27,"local_amount":420,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":432.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.23,"payment_id":579589089}],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T04:20:34Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:42:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":641008,"name":"Soloau","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soloau is a 23-year-old married woman with one child.

In addition, she raises chickens for fattening in the end-of-year season and she has been doing this for 11 years. Since she needs to bring income to her family, she decided on the business of making tortillas. Therefore, in the same manner, she went involving the other business that she does to date.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the other businesses, she butchers pigs 2 times a week. She carries out the activities in her house; she does not have to travel to work. Only her niece helps her and she starts at 5 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan to buy corn for the tortilla shop and purchase chickens for fattening to sell them in the end-of-year holidays.

She is married and has 6 children.  She began her business because she wanted to improve her status of living. In 2007, Fatu established her business selling general items.  She works at her business from 8:00 am to 7:00pm, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFatu requires a loan in order to purchase more items like cigarettes, biscuits, drinks and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her living condition. In the future, Fatu plans to own the biggest shop in her community. She thanks you for your

In this area nobody has potable water from their tap.  Many people use well water which is often very dirty.  To get safe drinking water people have to buy water, which is very expensive.  That is why Titin started to sell Nazava Water Filters and has so far had great success.  She paid her first KIVA loan back on time and also made same prepaid orders in between. \n\n \u201cSelling the Nazava filters for drinking water and for filtering household water for washing and cooking is a very appropriate business opportunity here in Cikarang and the surrounding area.  I hope that with this KIVA loan, I can become the largest agent in the greater Jakarta region.\u201d\n\nThis KIVA loan allows Titin to save on shipping costs, enables her to expand more quickly and will therefore provide more people with safe and affordable drinking water.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1481635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to expand water purifier sales and increase the access to safe and affordable drinking water in Cikarang, West Java, Indonesia","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cikarang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T01:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T01:40:11Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Titin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":22000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":4400000,"processed_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4425150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459156133},{"amount":1500,"local_amount":17600000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":17700600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490612957}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T11:48:26Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:43:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":652730,"name":"Qorilazo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cQORILAZO\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

The whole family works all day.\r\n\r\nThis year, Nataliya's second harvest suffered from the frost, so part of the crops was lost.  Her son also left home to study at a naval college with high tuition fees.  For these reasons, Nataliya has decided to apply for a loan of 30,000 hryvnia.  She will use the money to buy seeds, plastic sheeting and fertilizers for the new season.  She is very thankful for the help she is receiving, saying \"Thank you for all your help.

She says the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase bags of charcoal to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her welfare and increase her business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatmata plans to open a food stand table.

This is her greatest source of income for feeding her 2 daughters, ages 8 and 10.\r\n\r\nDolores has been making her living in cattle raising for the last 5 years. She learned this sector from her parents who worked raising cattle and making milk byproducts like cheese and curds; they sold them in the same region. People sell Dolores milk when she does not have production from her cows. This is how she does not lose this source of income for feeding her daughters.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be invested for the purchase of two pasture heifers, given that there is already a pasture to keep them along with the 4 cows she currently possesses.

Majmoua. They all work in Lebanon to provide their families a better living. They decided to join hands and establish the group because they all truly need support with their financial expenses. \r\n\r\n\r\nNida is the group leader and featured member of the group. She is the second lady from the right side of the picture and is wearing a yellow top. She is a 44-year-old single mother of five children, for whom she is sacrificing her life to provide them with the best living and education ever. They live back in the Philippines, where she dreams of going back and establishing her own business soon. She is the only financial provider of the family, since the children's father does not acknowledge the family any more. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that she has a very low income makes it impossible for her to be able to rightfully provide for her children, or even cover her own expenses. The Al Majmoua loan will be invested in supporting her in her own business, preparing and selling Filipino food. The loan will be used to buy necessary raw materials and special catering needs (plates, boxes and many other necessary required needs). This is a highly requested type of business in Lebanon, since it is a special foreign menu. She is very anxious about this loan, because she believes that developing her business will increase her income and help her develop her precious family's living.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the other group members, Sara Jane is at the center of the picture wearing a white top, Ederlyn is the first on the right with a white striped black top, Evelyn is the first on the left with a pink top, and Deveniel is the second from the left wearing a pink and white top.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1483432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to support her Filipino food business through buying necessary raw materials and special catering needs (plates, boxes and many other required needs).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Beirut","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.871944 35.509722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deveniel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ederlyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":427.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":414.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":414.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":414.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":414.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":414.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":427.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":427.5,"local_amount":427.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":427.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439630637},{"amount":414.5,"local_amount":414.5,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T09:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":414.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449538301},{"amount":414.5,"local_amount":414.5,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T08:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":414.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459003360},{"amount":414.5,"local_amount":414.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T09:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":414.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467813674},{"amount":829,"local_amount":829,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":829,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479036016}],"funded_date":"2013-12-11T15:13:13Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T09:03:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":641057,"name":"Penda","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La dame Penda, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 45 ans, \u00e9volue dans le commerce de divers produits susceptibles de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un profit \u00e0 la vente.

After finishing college, she was employed for 2 years, but after a time the business where she worked no longer needed her services and this drover her to look for alternatives to generate income that would allow her to help her mother supporting the home. She had the idea of producing personalized gift items such as cell phone and datebook cases, aprons, briefcases, and more. She started to make them and offer them on the internet. Today, after 8 months in business, her customers order via email or on the telephone, since each detail is personalized according to her customers' tastes. Right now, she is asking for the help of a loan to invest in creating a web page, buying an industrial planer, and buying materials wholesale (fabric, thread, canvas, and more). This will allow her to continue with her work dynamic and she will be able to optimize the production time with the new machine. The one she has doesn't give her the performance she needs. In addition, she will be able to have a website where she can exhibit her products and facilitate contact with her customer, thus improving her sales and the income she gets from this art. All of this will allow Lorena to keep advancing towards achieving her goals for the future. In the short term, she wants to open the market in other cities.

For this reason, he is applying for the support of the loan, with which he wants to buy wholesale agricultural supplies (compost, pesticides, and fertilizers, among other items), which are necessary to prepare the land and thus get a much more productive harvest, which will allow him to sell at a better price and thus increase his profit margin. F\u00e9lix only wants to continue this income-generating activity, because he is happy doing his work, and in the future he wants to expand his plantings to generate employment opportunities that will allow him to improve not only his quality of life, but also that of other neighbors in the

is an experienced farmer from Dalarik village of the Armavir region of Armenia. She lives with her husband and three school aged children (a 16-year-old son and two daughters - 15 and 12 years old). Aghavni's husband is a craftsman in the private sector.  He is the main breadwinner of the family and works hard to be able to make ends meet. To help her husband in earning a living for the family, Aghavni is engaged in cattle breeding, agriculture, and in the cultivation of sunflowers, grass, and grapes. She sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is an important source of income for the family. To sustain her agribusiness, Aghavni needs a loan of 3,000 USD to purchase a cow and some forage (grass and barley). She had previously taken a loan from a local financial institution but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Aghavni is now able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Aghavni and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain and develop their agribusiness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2846,"image":{"id":1483474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Today she counts on the help of a sister and a niece who work as direct employees. She has two other operators who are not directly employed who do the finishing and packing of the production. <br \/><br \/>The loan that Gloria is requesting will be invested in the purchase of wholesale supplies (cloth and thread). This will be used to make school and staff uniforms. Gloria will also be in a position to accept new contracts to increase her revenues. She hopes to to be able to attain her dream of having a workshop in a commercial space with access for vehicles to transport the product in a more efficient manner.

She has never counted on the support of her son's father. At 31 years old, she is the owner of a store where she sells clothing, bags, scarves from India, and crafts that she makes herself. She works alone every day from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and it is an activity that she learned from experience; that is how she manages to generate the economic resources that allow her to afford her basic household needs. Maria's strength, tenacity, and perseverance have allowed her to overcome the different obstacles that life presents, especially those that affect her economic stability. Sometimes her income is not enough to keep up with the family expenses, but it does not hold her back. Instead, motivated by her love for her son, she continues struggling tirelessly. Currently she is requesting a loan with which she would like to buy supplies wholesale (blouses, pants, bags, accessories, scarves, among others). With this she could have a wider variety of stock to offer her customers and satisfy their diverse wants and needs, managing to increase her sales and the income she earns for her work. This is how Maria hopes to continue fighting to carry on her business. Her main hope is to make it grow and establish herself enough to get a stand in the market, which would allow her to generate better economic resources and guarantee her economic stability to give her son a better future, with an education and quality of life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1482446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale supplies (blouses, pants, bags, accessories, scarves, among others).

Her eldest daughter is a university student, all the rest are in school. Her husband works as a machine operator in a local business. He has a salary, but unfortunately its not enough to provides for all of their family's needs which is why Nazgul has decided to help her husband with this. Nazgul has a secondary education. \r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Nazgul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 15 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nazgul's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 1 calf and 15 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). Her children help her with this business. They change the animals' water as well as cut and prepare the hay for the livestock. Nazgul performs all of the necessary activities to taking care of livestock. Two times per year, she uses a veterinarian's services. Nazgul has all of the necessary conditions required for housing her livestock. \r\n \r\nFor the purpose of further developing her business, Nazgul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan to buy goats to increase the size of her herd. Nazgul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for the future education of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1483402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy goats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Beshkent village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.2,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":253.18,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":12543.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.07,"payment_id":459019733},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":12543.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749646},{"amount":255.82,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12543.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.43,"payment_id":529947001},{"amount":239.55,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":12543.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.7,"payment_id":579488722}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T13:33:48Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":653158,"name":"Rubilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rubilyn, age 43, is married and blessed with five children.

During his life he has had four years of work experience working as a sawyer, however as he wanted to gain an income working independently he decided to stand down from that position and offer his services freelance. To do so he has had to rent a chainsaw.

Since he will not have to waste money paying rent on a machine, it will give him the freedom to do all types of jobs in many different areas in the region, thus increasing his sales and income.\r\n\r\nOrlando states that he wants to keep striving to achieve his goals.

girls and a boy. Her husband is a builder who works privately on a by-order basis. In his spare time, he helps Nazgul take care of the household and farm. Nazgul is a very hardworking and patient woman. Despite that fact that she has young children, she successfully manages to raise her children, feed them and spend time with them. In order to provide for a good future for her children, Nazgul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nazgul's hard work, she currently has 8 milk cows on her farm. Nazgul milks the cows herself and sell the milk for profit. Her monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Nazgul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Nazgul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for the future education of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1483444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chet-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":40.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":584.25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":30593.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":40.75,"payment_id":579488725}],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T14:16:31Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":653170,"name":"Delta Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geoffrey, who is in his early 40's, is married with four children who are still in school.

Jyldyz has gone through a difficult divorce with her husband. At first, she was completely lost and depressed. She did not know how to go on living with four children, how to raise them alone, how to take care of them. Finally, five years ago, she rented a small location where she currently makes baked goods. She did this with start-up capital in the amount of 3,000 som (KGS). Having developed her business and attracted loyal customers, Jyldyz has an average monthly income of 12,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing and expanding her business, Jyldyz turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan to buy two baking ovens.

","en":"Niyozali lives in the Rudaki district and is just getting started as a businessman. He is married and has six children. His four sons are between the ages of 10 and 21, and his two daughters are 8 and 16. His two eldest sons are in Russia: one is working and the other is getting ready to go to university. The rest of the children are still in school. His wife is a homemaker, and he himself worked as a taxi driver up until now. To improve his family's finances, Niyozali decided to start a retail business. He thinks selling grocery products will be profitable and therefore plans to open a shop. Niyozali already has a location for the store and just needs to buy food products. He has asked for a loan to help him do this. His wife and children will help Niyozali with the new business and hope very much for support.

She has five children: three of them are still studying and two are adults and work together with her and their father in agriculture. Every day, they perform different activities, such as spreading fertilizers and cleaning and weeding the fields. \r\n\r\nShe studied three years of primary school thanks to her parents, but could not continue due to the lack of economic support. Eight years ago, she started to grow coffee together with her husband, but she learned to do it when she was very young, thanks to her parents who have been working with this for many years. She also has a small grocery store at home and her customers are friends, relatives, neighbors and people from the surroundings. They work their own land, located close to where they live, so they have easy access to it and can easily give it maintenance.\r\n\r\nHer plans and goals for the future are to enlarge her coffee plantations and buy more land. She will plant more and better types of coffee in order to make her product more attractive to her customers. She wants to give her children the opportunity to study at the university and become professionals so that in the future, when she and her husband are gone, they can continue to work their land, start their own businesses, create jobs and be independent entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies, such as compost, leaf fertilizers and other types of fertilizers needed to strengthen and protect her coffee plantations."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":612.5,"image":{"id":1481486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies for her coffee plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":245,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T10:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595663580},{"amount":367.5,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":7541.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762583}],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T11:10:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":641153,"name":"Tinku","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tinku, a 37-year-old woman, is a rural resident of Haspatal Para in Maynaguri in the district Jalpaiguri.

","en":"Sayvali, a pharmacist, continues to work in his pharmacy. Two years ago he took out a loan to acquire antibiotics, syringes, and other essential supplies. He expresses his thanks to everyone for the financial support of his business. Sayvali values his business, since he takes care of the residents of his region with quality medical supplies and of his family with the income.

Reyna is originally from Sauce, in the north of Nicaragua, and is hard-working, responsible and has a desire to get ahead.  In her free time, Reyna likes to enjoy the company of her family.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to a lack of money, Reyna was not able to study at university and had to work from a young age.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and her desire to get ahead, Reyna now has a gym in her home.  She works ten hours every day.  This loan will be used to maintain the exercise machines in the gym so that, in the not-too-distant future, she can earn a higher income.  Reyna is grateful to Kiva investors for helping poor countries such as Nicaragua and for giving poor people the opportunity to have a decent job."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1504818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to invest in working capital and to maintain gym equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-01-02T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.63,"local_amount":1265.71,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1292.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449669236},{"amount":50.69,"local_amount":1267.3,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1293.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459139880},{"amount":50.58,"local_amount":1264.48,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1291.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955635},{"amount":48.5,"local_amount":1212.52,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176398},{"amount":50.78,"local_amount":1269.39,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1296.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490871046},{"amount":51.85,"local_amount":1296.19,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-23T09:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1323.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298298},{"amount":50.45,"local_amount":1261.21,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1287.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517581147},{"amount":50.43,"local_amount":1260.8,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1287.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530064461},{"amount":105.09,"local_amount":2627.17,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542557763},{"amount":48.8,"local_amount":1220.02,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579618619},{"amount":42.2,"local_amount":1055.21,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595205229}],"funded_date":"2014-01-08T22:07:48Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T14:06:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":653187,"name":"Samini","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samini is a married woman with four children;

","en":"Jorge Enrique is an honest, tolerant, and responsible person who has endeavored to carry out the activities he proposes to perform. He is currently enrolled in the 11th grade and has ended the first semester of Assembly, Repair, and Maintenance of Computer Hardware with CampoAlto. \r\nSince his childhood, he has been curious about mechanical and electrical operations invented by humankind. \r\nOn of the great reasons to study in CampoAlto for Jorge Enrique is due to his mother, Adriana, who studied to be a nursing assistant as one of the first graduates of ACESALUD in 2001. Jose Enrique took into account the great efficiency and achievement that CampoAlto has at the forefront in the area of industry and the development of work competency.\r\nWith the current knowledge and development that exists in the world, Jorge Enrique has developed a liking of the subject of assembly and maintenance since adding different operating systems to the internal components of a computer provides great functionality. \r\nAnother additional reason to have a career in assembly and maintenance is that Jorge Enrique's brother, Cristhian, is working with technology and gives Jorge Enrique the inspiration and motivation to pursue this career.\r\nIt is an excellent career for his entry into the field that will allow him to work in different types of jobs.\r\nJorge Enrique belongs to a group of young people who currently pay a budget tuition for the semester, however, the tuition for next semester has increased and his family can not cover the extra amount because of their lack of resources, therefore, he needs a Kiva loan to ease his tuition payment and finish his studies.

","en":"Lina Mar\u00eda's starting her second semester of pharmaceutical services.  She lives with her mother, father, and brother.\r\n\r\nLina Mar\u00eda's mother currently doesn't have a fixed income because she works in child care and doesn't get paid if she gets sick or suffers some setback.  Her father earns minimum wage working as a messenger for a temporary job agency.  This is the only household income.  Lina Mar\u00eda doesn't work because it's difficult for a minor to earn an acceptable wage in a respectable place.\r\n\r\nLina Mar\u00eda needs help from Kiva because she was making a fairly affordable monthly payment but the amount almost doubled so it's difficult for her to pay it.  Also, she's finishing her degree next year and will have to pay the graduation fees.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 54 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Jacob is pictured on the right of the Bidii Group with his hand raised.\r\n\r\nJacob is married and has six children. He is 42 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Jacob has been a farmer for 18 years. Jacob described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJacob first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Jacob joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Jacob plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, buy a goat and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Jacob\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

He is, however, constrained financially and is hoping to receive a loan from Kiva that will enable him to purchase these farm inputs.
