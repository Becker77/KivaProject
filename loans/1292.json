Jeomar is originally from Sauce, in the north of Nicaragua.  She is hard-working, responsible and has a desire to get ahead. Unfortunately due to a lack of money, Jeomar was not able to study at university and had to work from a young age in order to help with household bills.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts and her desire to get ahead, Jeomar works selling staple goods.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nPamela is married and has five children.  She is 30 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking,  reliable,  trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Pamela has been a farmer for 13 years.  Pamela described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Pamela\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  She first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds and to earn enough to feed her family and send her  children to school.  \r\n\r\nAs an active member in her community, Pamela also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and  spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nPamela plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school and save for the future.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from harvest, more of farm training, more farm group support, and is able to save money and  feed the family.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Pamela and the Mahanga Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1483548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":235356,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235356}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2725,"local_amount":235356,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":236121.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722786}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T16:50:56Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":653246,"name":"Muashoki Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stumai, who is in her mid 50s, is married with four children, one of whom goes to school and the rest have finished schooling.

She is pictured here in a group of One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 36 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Emma has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEmma is married and has three children.  She is 25 years old and is known as friendly, hard-working, reliable and trustworthy and an experienced farmer. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's prayer group and burial committee.  Emma has been a farmer for eight years.  Emma described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEmma joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Emma joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  Because she is an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Emma has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Emma's life because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and was able to feed the family.  In the future, Emma hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and a goat and invest in a business.  \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEmma and the Mulika Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1483540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cost-efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moureen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":240705,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240705}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2800,"local_amount":240705,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":242619.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722788}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T00:07:13Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":641211,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is a 23-year-old married man who has one child.

","en":"Faizali is a young and active resident of the Farkhor region. He is 27 years old. He is married and his wife is a housewife. Faizali has higher education in accounting. He works as an accountant at a village school. \n\nFaizali has a cowshed in his yard. He decided to start a cattle breeding business. Faizali is interested in buying and reselling cattle.

She describes herself as honest, and earns a living by running a retail business where she sells bread, milk, sugar and other household goods. She has been involved in this business for two years and operates out of a busy area. Her biggest challenge is a lack of funds.

Because of this he is unable to generate any amount of income.  He wants to repair it as soon as possible.  However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing his rickshaw.  Therefore Zahida, as a member of a two person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband cover the cost of repairing his rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

laboratory analysis. She always wanted to have her private business built on her specialty, and in 1993 she was finally able to establish it. With over 10 years experience she remembers that one of the main challenges for her to start up her business was the fact that the nature of her business obviously requires her to be located close to doctors and clinics. This means being new in an area where such businesses and offices are concentrated in, where rent is expensive, space is difficult to find, and establishing reputation as a newcomer is challenging.\n\nZainab has not only overcome those initial challenges, by now she has built a reputation through her precise work and genuine work ethic. Respected by peers and family, Zainab speaks highly of her husband who has been supporting her in all her endeavours. With such support Zainab is not only a successfully laboratory owner, but she is also a respected mother of 4 children.\n\nHer children and husband are proud of her achievements, and Zainab has more ambitious goals to attain in the future. She would like to continuously improve to eventually become the best in her city and accredited by the doctors and clinics in the area.\n\nHer growing business and enthusiasm built on a truly scientific foundation qualifies Zaineb to participate in the WLIFT special training program for SME clients and have also made her eligible to take a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq to purchase a new machine with all its utilities for hormone analysis.\n\nAs she explains with her own words: I\u2019m Zainab, Laboratorial Assistant (this is the official title for graduates from Technical Colleges with Diploma \u201ctwo year study\u201d), I would like to get a loan from Relief International for the purpose of purchasing an analysis\/system device to improve\/speed up my work. Thank you very much.  \n\nIn addition to the investment in the business, from the training Zainab hopes to gain in-depth knowledge to develop the business and serve her clients better through improved administrative and management skills."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":12500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":12500,"image":{"id":1501052,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2912,"youtubeId":"6imU-NGvHSw","title":"Kiva Borrower

Sylvia currently sells to wholesalers and came to realize that she did not have enough financial capital. So, she joined the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Florecitas\u201d so that she can purchase more products in bulk like watermelons, pineapples, plantains, bananas and melons, as well as potatoes, carrots and onions. Silvia travels to two different towns to buy and sell her products. She does this 2 or 3 days each week so that leaves her time to spend with her family.\r\n\r\nSilvia and the rest of the ladies in the Trust Bank learn a great deal from the educational trainings that they participate in during their monthly meetings on subjects like self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, business management, nutrition and medicinal plants. This month, they are learning about the importance of children\u2019s education.

As a little girl she would make clothes for her dolls. With this love and passion she developed her skills and became a professional seamstress. With skill, passion, and ambition she grew the business and currently employs 3 other seamstresses. It is also used as a facility to train other women who would like to learn and work in this sector.  \n\nAt the start of the business she faced many challenges; one of the biggest ones was the high rent of shops, but with a little creativity and a lot of work, she managed to find an interesting solution. She rented a property from the government for 25 years and had a modest, but sufficient, building built on it, which is perfectly suitable for the sewing workshop.   \n\nHer creativity, dedication and potential for continued growth qualifies her to participate in the WLIFT training program and to take an SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq. She would like purchase additional, high quality embroidery machines which will enable her to provide a new set of services and deliver more competitive products. \n\nAs she explains with their own words: I\u2019m Shukria. I\u2019ve been a tailor for 20 years. I want to develop my business and improve my factory. With the help of Relief International, I will advance my business. I will purchase good quality embroidery machines to improve my services. Now I have three female workers with me, and, with God\u2019s will, the number of workers will increase to more than seven, as I have a big space and five sewing machines.\n\nShukria is a member of the industry union and constantly keeps an eye on the type of services in demand. The in-demand embroidery is one of these services she has learned about and would like to add to improve her business opportunities. \n\nShukria is 45 years old. She is a widow and a mother of 2 children whom she is supporting and raising alone \u2013 showing a great example to all children in the neighborhood about what hard work can achieve.  She is well respected, and although she did not receive a formal education, she has had a lifelong learning experience and has become a business woman with sustainable income.   \n\nShe would like to continue to grow, increase her income and continue to be a respected valuable member of her community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1501075,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2913,"youtubeId":"CRrPBkG4HbY","title":"Kiva Borrower

Now they are experiencing a tough time due to their poverty. \r\n\r\nMarjina has taken the initiative to help her husband financially. She heard that BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) offers loans to women in their community, so she applied for a loan of 15,000 INR to purchase potato seeds and fertilizers for growing potatoes in her own land along with the other vegetables. She has given preference to this business as potato cultivation is a very profitable job in her area. Potatoes have great demand in her area and they are used in most Indian dishes, so that\u2019s why Marjina hopes she can extend her business with the profit from her business.

The other two sons are working for a building contractor.\r\n\r\nSanju's husband owns a cycle-van.  He earns money by carrying people and goods in his cycle-van. Sanju works in animal husbandry, a business she began five years ago and which serves as a major source of income for the family. But they need more money to give financial sustenance to their family.\r\n\r\nSanju came to know about BJS and has taken a loan from them to purchase a cow and start a new business of milk supply and making dairy products like paneer (fresh cheese), butter and curd, which are in great demand in the present market. She will sell her products to her neighbours. She hopes to get an increase in the production of milk which, ultimately, helps in generating more cash.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of giving better education to her children, overcoming the financial hurdles, and purchasing more cows with the profit generated from her business and making a cattle herd.\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1504701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a cow to start a business selling milk and milk products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-01-02T18:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T18:30:08Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T20:31:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":652951,"name":"Shamim's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamim is from Pakistan!

She has a 6th grade education and a degree as a beautician. Two of her sons are high school graduates, one with a specialization in Administration and the other in Hotel and Tourism. Her youngest son is in 9th grade. She knows the value of education for herself and for her children.\n\nAlva has owned a combination general store and beauty shop in San Juan del Obispo near Antigua, Guatemala for three years. Alva is seeking a loan of GTQ30,000 for expansion and growth. She has observed that many local residents take time-consuming trips to Antigua to buy things that she could be profitably selling there in San Juan. Her dream is to create a small supermarket in her building as there isn\u2019t one locally. \n\nHer first steps will be to use the beauty shop area and some spare rooms in her attached home, to accommodate new product lines such as bookstore items, paper products and metal goods. She will also expand her offerings of food and household items. She will begin accepting debit cards, hire an additional worker and blanket the community with flyers and posters. It is the size and scope of what she is trying to do that make her an exceptional candidate for the advanced training and larger loan of the Namaste Starz program.\n\nIn working with Fundaci\u00f3n Namaste Guatemaya (FNG), Alva recently completed its nine-month Basic Business Development program and increased her monthly profits by 33% to GTQ9,000. Alva is highly motivated as shown by the fact that she works 70-hour weeks to achieve her goals! Now by working with FNG\u2019s STARZ program she is aiming for monthly profits of GTQ11,824 by the end of 2014.\n\nThe STARZ program is unique in the world of microfinance as the loan repayments are tied to the profits of the borrower instead of being fixed payments. Since loan payments are linked to profits she can ride out business cycles or other unforeseen events.\n\nThrough the STARZ program high potential women receive intensive business coaching bi-weekly over two to three years. They also receive a formal six-month education in financial literacy and business operations that leads to a diploma in Small and Medium Enterprise Management by the Guatemalan Technical Institute for Training and Productivity (INTECAP). Credit is not generally available to women with businesses of this size, so an important program element is a right-sized business loan. \n\nThe women also receive coaching in leadership, economic and gender empowerment, and renegotiating household power relationships. By working with Fundaci\u00f3n Namaste Guatemaya, the STARZ participant and her business advisor have a continuous-loop, real-time monitoring, evaluation and learning system.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2518.75,"image":{"id":1484612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to pay for a new bookstore and paper products lines in her store.

is 49 years old and is married to Samser, 60 years old. They live in Dhupguri with their four children. Both of them are illiterate, but can sign their names. Jabeda is a housewife and sometimes works as a daily laborer with an inconsistent income. Her husband has involved himself in farming seasonal vegetables on his own farmland. He sells the vegetables to the local market, but he is unable to earn sufficient income for his family. \r\n\r\nTheir children also engaged themselves in agricultural work. Day by day their financial condition is going down, and they are losing their hope for being successful at meeting the family\u2019s basic needs. \r\n\r\nJabeda wishes to grow potatoes to generate more income. They have their own land and experience in the agricultural field. This is the main reason for choosing this business.

Right now she wants to count on Kiva so that she can continue her studies. It really would be very useful because she doesn't have the resources necessary to continue in this amazing field and doesn't want to abandon her dream at the half-way mark. Together with Kiva she can continue striving for this goal. Her objective is to complete this phase and obtain a good job so she can continue with the nursing profession and specialize in two areas, namely pediatrics and OB-GYN. That way her life would be linked with the care and wellness of people who need it. After finishing these stages she knows she will be able to help her family financially, and healthwise because of the daily care she could provide. This is one of the most difficult fields of study, but also one of the most rewarding because she would be a part of incomparable and unforgettable stories every day.

Like other members of her group, due to economic hardship, her family is currently using a double-pit latrine which is now degraded. With a portion of this loan, Luom will be able to build a hygienic septic tank latrine and a hand-washing device with soap. Those facilities would also help her family improve their health and living conditions, as well as afford safety for them, particularly at night and during rainstorms. In addition, the facilities will provide convenience, cleanliness, and privacy for all family members, while contributing to the environmental protection of the community.

Their only son is studying in class V (grade 5). She has completed class VIII standard (grade 8) but her husband is illiterate. Throughout the day, she manages all the household work and her husband keeps himself busy selling grocery items from his grocery shop. Shampa wishes to extend this business because their grocery shop is in great demand in her area. There is only one shop in the village of Baroghoria at Dhupguri where the villagers usually buy their daily grocery items. She wants to renovate their shop with more grocery items but they have no capital to meet the demands of the shop. She learned about BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) and requested a loan to buy more grocery items for their shop. In the future, she wants to become a good entrepreneur and improve her business gradually with the profit she can earn from the shop. She can make her concrete house more beautiful with the profit from the business. Shampa sincerely thanks BJS and Kiva for their kind support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1504732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is Nenita, 57, resident of Batasan, Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Leve and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household, while operating a business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nNenita maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct-selling brands, like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. \r\n\r\nA customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s costs are lower than those in the catalog and the difference represents the profit that dealers are counting on as their income. \r\n\r\nNenita's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Nenita is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products, like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nNenita dreams to add another business and hopes to have a better living. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1271929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

He tells why he needs this KIVA loan in its own words: \n\n\"[My] business started as one kiosk in the city of Manokwari and one kiosk in a nearby village.  I am now in the beginning stages of opening two more kiosks in two other villages in the next several months, so that those villages can also have access to clean and affordable drinking water.\n\nIn the province of West Papua, Indonesia, very few people have access to drinking water that is both safe AND affordable.  Many people are forced either to purchase bottled water that is very expensive or boil their own water which also is expensive, labor-intensive, and pollutes the environment.  In the areas far from the city, because boiling water requires so much work, many people risk drinking untreated water and, as a result, continually suffer from water-borne illnesses. Nazava\u2019s water filtration technology provides a superior alternative in its simple design, affordability, and ability to produce safe drinking water. My business\u2019s primary goal is to actively portray Jesus Christ\u2019s love for all people by caring for the physical needs of the people of West Papua via:\n\n1.\tProviding a safe, affordable, and practical clean drinking water solution to the communities throughout Papua Barat.\n2.\tTeaching and equipping other aspiring Papuan entrepreneurs how to open their own kiosks in their villages and how to run a successful kiosk business selling the Nazava filters.\n\nBecause the demand for the Nazava filters is so high, I have trouble keeping sufficient stock to meet the demand.  I do not charge a high profit margin, which makes it difficult to increase my business\u2019 inventory.  This loan will allow me to increase my inventory and minimize the time I am out of stock and cannot serve the local community.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1481648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to provide a safe, affordable, and practical clean drinking water solution to the communities throughout Papua Barat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Manokwari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Socrates","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":22000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5500000},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5500000},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5500000},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1875,"local_amount":22000000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":22125750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490612958}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T20:54:23Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:43:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":641354,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn is a hardworking entrepreneur who operates a general store in the Philippines, which she has been doing for five years.

children on her own. Last year in August,  Ardakbubu's husband died from a serious illness. Struggling to survive the death of her beloved husband, Ardakbubu braced herself, as it was necessary to start a new life without a spouse but with children who need to land on their feet. The children helped Ardakbubu to recover. <br \/><br \/>Ardakbubu has a specialized high school education. She graduated from a technical school, with a specialty as a cook. She worked as a cook for just five years.<br \/><br \/>As a main source of income for her family, Ardakbubu raises livestock, having started 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Ardakbubu and her children currently have on their homestead: one dairy cow, 15 sheep, and similarly Ardakbubu with her children works 2.40 hectares of land, where she grows mainly beans and potatoes. The resulting crop is sold to wholesale suppliers. Monthly income consists of 4,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Ardakbubu turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan - to buy cows for expanding her count of livestock. <br \/><br \/>Ardakbubu plans to invest income from the loan in further propagation of domestic animals, and plans to save money for her son's wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1483493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kok-Kashat village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Orphan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ardakbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":511.62,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":25086.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.88,"payment_id":529947005},{"amount":479.09,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25086.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.41,"payment_id":579488729}],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T22:23:15Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":641372,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vilma works hard to support her family.

She is 56 years old.  She works as a teacher at a school.  Her husband works at a dekhan farm.  She has three children.  Her sons have grown up and now help the family.  But the income in the family is not enough for continued family development.  Animal husbandry and farming are the primary types of activities for the village residents. In order to increase the quality of living for her family, Turdi is involved in breeding livestock.  Her children and husband help her with this.  She wants to request a loan to buy livestock and feed to grow her business.  Turdi came to Arvand with this goal and she is certain that she can grow her business and, thus, increase her family's

She started with farm labor and household chores when she was ten years old, learning from her parents. She grows her crops on a plot of land close to her house. There are some seasons in which the farm does not do very well and her income to maintain her family is much lower. Therefore, a few months ago, she started raising chickens and taking care of her milk cow so that it produces more milk and she can sell more cheese.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan to buy fertilizer and insecticide to cultivate 7,000 square meters of corn. She will also buy a cage for her chickens. What she most wants, however, is to buy another cow. She hopes to have good harvests and better earnings for her family, so that they do not suffer what she suffered.

raising four children together with her husband. Her husband is a farmer, and children attend a school.  Aigul has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 18 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aigul's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 2 horses and 5 calves. Aigul and her family already prepared 450 haystacks, 1 ton of barley and 8 tons of corn.

She lives with her partner and has two children, aged 3 and 5. After finishing her secondary education, she started working to help her parents. \r\n\r\nShe principally works with wool fabrics to make clothing, particularly stockings, caps and sweaters for both girls and boys. She makes these in a variety of colors, depending on the customer's order. She learned to sew and weave from her older sister, who had been in this same line of work for a long time.\r\n\r\nJessica is in her first year with Edaprospo.

Now she has two children.  They go to school and she's a single mother who she raises her children alone because her husband abandoned her.\r\n\r\nRosa helped her mother with the agricultural labor after she stopped going to school.  Now she plants 14,000 square meters of corn with the help of her sister.  She also has had a small store for the last year and a half, which has improved her income and minimized the risk of being left without an income.  Depending solely on the corn, often the losses are numerous and the crop is seriously affected.\r\n\r\nThe land she farms is 2.5 kilometers from her house and she gets there on bicycle, working from 6 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon.  Her sister helps her with the work and they hire the services of another person to help with the heaviest work that they can't do.\r\n\r\nShe'll invest the loan in expanding the store where she has the merchandise, buying more products to sell, and having a larger caf\u00e9.

Emigdio used to work as a farmer but left that job to his children and now makes a living as a self-employed construction worker.  Agustina works in a nearby convenience store helping with anything that is needed.  \n\nThe house they live in is the result of years of work.  The tin roof makes the house really humid in spring and summer and very cold in winter, and with their age these changes are harder each year.  Emigdio wants to change the roof for a more adequate one and build a proper bathroom in the house so there is no need to walk outside every time they want to use it.  Emigdio and Agustina have been saving for the last three months to replace the roof with a proper cement roof and to build the bathroom. \n\nTogether, the couple makes around $800 USD a month.

He's done this ever since he was a young boy. His father taught him and his siblings about farming. His land is about a kilometre from his house. Both his wife and his eldest son help him. The mornings are spent tending the cows, and then he sets off for his fields where he looks after his crops.\r\n\r\nDaily buying and selling livestock is another source of income for Jos\u00e9 and his family.

All her children are married and live on their own except for the youngest, who lives with them and helps them tend to their farm.  \r\n\r\nGulaiym is an old hand at raising livestock; she's been at it 43 years, and started off with only 1,000 som worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, she currently has 2 dairy cows and 6 sheep on her farm, and her monthly income is nearly 10,000 som.  To expand her farm, she's seeking a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners to buy a heifer.  She plans on using any extra money that the loan will allow her to make to add even more livestock to her farm, as well as to save money to buy a

He only studied until the 8th grade because financial resources were scarce and he could not continue his school work and so he dedicated himself full time to working. His partner is a housewife and they have 2 children. One is 4 and about to begin kindergarten and one is 2 months old.\r\n\r\nEver is a small farmer. He works 7,000 square meters of corn. He learned as a youth since his father was a farmer and taught him this work. He has also been working for 15 years in a carpentry workshop as there are times when the harvest only provides enough for consumption and he needs to pay some expenses. He does not have a work schedule but when he is in the workshop he gets there at 7:00AM and as he is paid by piece work he does not have a set departure time. \r\n\r\nHe plans to use the loan to work 7,000 square meters of irrigated corn, God willing, to harvest in April. The loan gives him an opportunity to get ahead as the money that he earns in the carpentry workshop will be used to pay for school fees for his son and for feeding the family.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have a better quality of life and to be able to support his children so they can have the education he was not able to have. The loan will provide a motivation to work and make more sacrifices in order to be certain not only that he can meet his dreams and those of his family but also he is thinking of not being an employee of a workshop but to have his own carpentry workshop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1503998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies and to work 7,000 square meters of irrigated corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ever Ulises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215971}],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T05:02:27Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":653415,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After losing her husband to the violence of South Sudan, Joyce fled the country with her children in search of a new life. When she arrived in Kenya, she made contact with a British organization that assists refugees in Nairobi, and after a few months of waiting, Joyce and her family were permitted to immigrate to the United States as refugees.\r\n\r\nDespite experiencing the tremendous culture shock of moving to a new country, Joyce made the best of her situation. She found a job at a San Diego health center and worked there until she was recently laid off.  She began looking for employment through a temporary employment agency, but had difficulty finding a job in the crowded job market. Instead of letting her circumstances hold her back, she instead saw it as an opportunity to take her employment into her own hands. \r\n\r\nShe began selling a variety of cultural goods, such as traditional Sudanese clothing and art pieces, taking out her first microloan to fund her venture.  She eventually moved into selling lotions, perfumes and cr\u00e8mes at local swap meets, focusing on selling consumer goods that would appeal to the local African immigrant community.  \r\n\r\nNow on her eighth microloan, Joyce has demonstrated tremendous character through the years with regular, on-time repayments and a commitment to growing her business. She plans to use her $4,000 Kiva loan to increase her inventory, enabling her to sell at additional outdoor markets and ultimately grow her income.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what her business dream would be, she shared, \u201cI want to become financially independent and perhaps start my own import and export business one day.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3608.58,"image":{"id":1504963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

They live in their home and Teresa and her two children are supported by her husband.\r\n\r\nTeresa dedicates herself to the work of the household chores in her home and the care of her children while her husband goes to work. She says that since she was small she has been engaged in this activity that was taught to her by her own mother. Since she was little her mother helped her learn this activity and Teresa says it is a very important activity and that she is proud to preform it for her family and that she is always supported by her husband in the work they do.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is for the installation of electricity in their home because, up to now, they do not have this service that is so necessary for them. For several years they have had the desire to put electricity in their home and not be in the dark at night, a condition which generated insecurity at home because there was no proper lighting.\r\n\r\nTeresa has always wanted to continue studying and working and finish a college career. She wants to live in a house that is dignified and for her child to be a good person and study a lot.

He finished his High School which his parents struggled to provide him with in order to get ahead. He lives with his mother, who is the person who helped him in so much, growing up together with his brother. The brothers work together in agriculture and their mother is dependent on them. <br \/><br \/>Mario has worked in agriculture since he was 16. His father taught him to work the fields and thanks to this he has a lot of knowledge today about the different activities required to produce a harvest. He and his brother work together growing 10,500 square meters of corn and beans. They have to walk 45 minutes to get to their fields. And to work and to sell their harvest they have to carry the product on their backs or by animal. They don't have normal work hours, they work until the job is done. <br \/><br \/>The loan that Mar\u00edo is requesting is to pay for labor to harvest their crops as it is too difficult for just him and his brother. They have a lot of work to do and this helps their client as the crops have to be transported to his house. From there the harvest can be sold and they will have income to pay the loan and help their mother with the household expenses.<br \/><br \/>Mar\u00edo wants to continue working in agriculture and wants to harvest more in the coming season. So he hopes his brother will continue to help him. He also has the support of his mother to help him along. He is thinking of buying a plot of land to build his own house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1482716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for labor to harvest their crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T01:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T01:00:05Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00edo Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.66,"local_amount":87.66,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":87.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622392},{"amount":187.34,"local_amount":187.34,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":187.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216636}],"funded_date":"2013-12-04T07:59:29Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":641452,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha is a married mother and has children, all of whom attend school.
