He has been learning the techniques to work on a lathe machine from professionals. Now he has come to know how to operate a lathe machine so that he can carry on his newly started business. Due to his lack of experience, the lathe machine has gotten damaged and needs maintenance. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Noor requested a loan for her husband so that he can fulfill the deficiencies of the lathe

She lives accompanied by her life partner. Ever since she was young her parents have taught her everything related to farm work, and as a result she has been able to work as an employee on various dairy farms.\r\n\r\nShe is in charge of caring for and milking the cows. Some time ago she obtained her first dairy cows and since then she has been handling the success of her business independently. Everything produced is sold and so this generates the financial resources sufficient to assist her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is asking for help with financing as she wants to buy two dairy cows which will permit her to increase her production and thus cope with the challenges she faces such as low sale prices and the high cost of agricultural supplies that she needs to care for the animals. However, she is aware that to achieve her goals, she must continue fighting with care, discipline, and dedication. Only then will she be able to achieve the dream of expanding her business and of buying a greater number of dairy cattle that will guarantee a favorable financial stability in order to be able to offer her son a better education and to enjoy a better quality of life in the company of her loved ones."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1482734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

His son who is 13 is the one who helps him work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in agriculture all his life. He began to work with his father, since he was one of the oldest, and so he had to help him work to earn a living for the whole family. He has to walk about 2 kilometers to arrive at his field. He doesn't have a regular schedule, since it depends on the crop, and his son accompanies him after he leaves school, since he is teaching him how to work the land.\r\n\r\nWith the money from the loan, he will buy seeds, fertilizer, and all the supplies that he is going to need for the 7000 square meters of corn that he is going to grow.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have a house in better conditions than those he has now, and also to be able to give all his children the education he did not have. With the loan, he knows that it is a commitment, but he also knows well that it will serve as an incentive to work more and in better conditions, and he knows he will only achieve it based on much effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1504005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy the seeds, fertilizer, and all the supplies that he is going to need for the 7000 square meters of corn that he is going to grow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T02:30:06Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903370}],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T17:11:59Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":653465,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a buy-and-sell banana business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 12,000 through NWTF to purchase more bananas to resell in her buy-and-sell banana business.\r\n\r\nTeresita has been in this business for three years.

He was born into a very humble family who taught him when he was very young to do all the farm chores so that when he was grown he could earn his own livelihood. Thanks to that, he has worked in agriculture for more than 31 years, and he now has plantings of corn, beans, and passion fruit. In addition, he has breeding cattle and produces milk. All the production that he obtains from his different activities is sold to generate sufficient income to pay the expenses of his family, which consists of his wife and two children, ages 8 and 6. With the intention of continuing his activities, he is applying for the support of the loan to buy two milk cows that will replace two animals that are in a period of gestation. Thus he will be able to maintain his level of production so that he will be able to face the challenges that are presented to him because of the high costs of the agricultural supplies that he needs and the low sales price for his products. Jos\u00e9 says that his principal goal is to expand his production of milk, since he has a lot of available space to have more animals and thus be able to achieve a financial stability that will help him to offer a better future and well-being to his children and his

Her daughter is 12 years old and is in school. Nazgul has a higher education. She works as a teacher in a local school. She has a lot of experience working with children, therefore all the children in the village and their parents respect her very much as a highly-qualified teacher and simple person. <br \/><br \/>As a source of additional income for her family, Nazgul is engaged in raising livestock, having started 19 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 6,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Nazgul currently has on her homestead: two dairy cows, two horses, and 13 sheep. Her husband - a farmer - helps Nazgul around the farm. Together they prepare the feed in unison, change the water, and clean the stable. Nazgul manages to teach at the school and to take care of her household. Monthly income consists of 8,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her farm, Nazgul turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan - to buy steers for fattening and subsequent sale at the market at a high price. <br \/><br \/>Nazgul plans to invest income from the loan to further propagate the quantity of domestic animals, and also in the future intends to purchase an automobile."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1484010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy steers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":65.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1031.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1120.75,"local_amount":55000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":55527.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.63,"payment_id":459019738},{"amount":463.53,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":25239.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":52.09,"payment_id":595435901}],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T21:12:06Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":653502,"name":"Thoy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thoy (in the photo) lives in a village about twenty kilometers south of Phnom Penh City.

","en":"Lola is a kind and responsible woman from the city of Qurgan-Tube.  She is 31 years old, married, and she has three children (two daughters who are 12 and 7 years old, and a son who is 5).  For the past two years, she has been sewing traditional Tajik comforters from quilted cotton called, \"kurpa\" and \"kurpacha\".  Her sewing services are always in high demand because in every Tajik family, a young woman receives a \"kurpa\" and \"kurpacha\" when she gets married.  For this reason, Lola's business is quite profitable.\r\n\r\nLola's husband works on a construction site in Russia, and sends money home every month so that his wife can take care of the family's expenses.  Lola currently wants to help her brother-in-law (her sister's husband), who, until now, had been providing taxi services, for a few years, using his own car.  However, Lola's sister and and brother-in-law have had to perform major repairs in their house lately.  Having miscalculated their financial capacity, they ended up having to sell the car to complete their home repairs, which left the family without any source of income.  Lola is well aware of her sister's difficult circumstances, and she would like to help her.\r\n\r\nLola already has some savings, but she is also requesting a loan to cover the missing amount.  She plans to buy a good-quality new car for her brother-in-law.   Her brother-in-law plans to convert this car to natural gas, and will use it to resume his activity. Lola and her family really need this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n

He learned the job by doing it.  He works alone every day, but his highest income comes on the weekend because he has steady customers.  He sees an advantage in his broad experience, but sometimes he's challenged by the amount of competition in this line of work.  This is how he earns enough money to support his two-year-old son and pay for his basic household necessities.\r\n\r\nCurrently Hugo's requesting the loan to buy a bass and to maintain his equipment.  This way he'll have the possibility of offering better and more complete customer service and improving the amount of money he earns from his job.\r\n\r\nHugo wants to make his business grow and turn it into a great sound business that will be competitive and profitable.

with her husband, is raising four children. All of her children are little, with the oldest being 11 years old and the youngest, 2 years old. Damira has a higher education. She works as a teacher at a local school. She has a small salary. Her husband works odd jobs as he cannot find full-time employment. \r\n\r\nAs an additional source of income for her family, Damira practices livestock breeding. She started this business 14 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Damira's hard work, she currently has 7 milk cows, 1 horse and 6 sheep on her farm. Damira is very hardworking. Everyday she gets up at the crack of dawn and gets her children ready for school. Then she cuts hay and waters her livestock, goes to work, returns home for lunch, feeds her livestock again, meets her children at school, brings them home, feeds them dinner and finishes her work in the barn. \r\n\r\nShe is very motivated and believes that by working hard and consistently on her animal breeding business, she will be able to improve her family's wellbeing and provide a better future for her children. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Damira turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Damira plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for the future education of her children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1484283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

In this way, she can keep fighting to be able to make her greatest dream come true: to allow her daughter to become a professional, and to have a big business sewing garments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1505100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T13:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T13:50:12Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":74.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":77.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":82.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":84.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":88.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":91.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.9,"local_amount":74.76,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450391612},{"amount":31.16,"local_amount":77.88,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":87.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459068033},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":82.57,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:20:49Z","rounded_local_amount":92.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467880957},{"amount":33.84,"local_amount":84.59,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-01T09:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":94.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479104447},{"amount":72.08,"local_amount":180.2,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":201.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490799503}],"funded_date":"2014-01-04T00:53:54Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:09:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":653531,"name":"Kibibi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kibibi is married and has four children, all of whom go to school.

Her older daughter is 17 years old and is a student in the eleventh grade. Her son is 13 years old and a student in the seventh grade. Batma and her children were left without the main member of their family, without a father and husband. She dreams that her children will study at a prestigious university so that the will have good jobs. Unfortunately, Batma only finished secondary school and for the last 16 years has been in the business of animal breeding. She started this business 16 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Batma's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 15 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS).

in a rural village of the Cheung Prey district of Kampong Cham province, Cambodia, Mai is 46 years old and a widowed mother of two children. Nowadays, one schoolchild still depends on her.  \r\n\r\nFor the sake of her family, Mai has been farming on two hectares of rice farm as the main source of income and supplements her family income via a pig-raising business. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Mai with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

A few months ago, he was doing a job as a laborer in a firm on very low wages. \r\n\r\nNow, he has decided to drive a rickshaw again. He already had an auto rickshaw of his own, but he was not driving it due to its damaged body. Suriya gave him a piece of advice that he should drive his own auto rickshaw, and this time, he has agreed to drive. Therefore, she is taking loan to encourage her husband, so that he can buy a new rickshaw body and drive the auto rickshaw again.\r\n \r\nSuriya hopes that her husband will stabilize with this profession this time and drive an auto rickshaw for the long run.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.

He is 58 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, the savings group, the prayer group and the burial committee.  Albert has been a farmer for 20 years.  He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\r\n\r\nHe first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and to earn enough to feed his family and send their children to school.  As an active member in his community, Albert also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes leading. He also wants to help more farmers in his community and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nAlbert plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, more of farm training, more farm group support, and is able to save money and feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAlbert and the Alpha Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3575,"image":{"id":1483590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer.\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T15:00:04Z","loan_amount":3575,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hosea ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":310242,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":310242}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3575,"local_amount":310242,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":310309.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722789}],"funded_date":"2014-01-29T18:24:08Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":641553,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum and millet.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T15:00:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":16100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":16100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":8050,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":8680,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468017150},{"amount":13.48,"local_amount":1085,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-26T09:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1169.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240530},{"amount":39.75,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-29T09:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3450.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517652129},{"amount":24.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-04T09:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2156.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530133580}],"funded_date":"2013-12-11T00:35:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":641544,"name":"Muna Ahmed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muna Ahmed is 20 years old.

All\u00ed estudia hasta quinto semestre, pero una vez m\u00e1s el sue\u00f1o se ve interrumpido, en esta ocasi\u00f3n por motivos econ\u00f3micos.

","en":"Mar\u00eda Fernanda is a very enterprising woman who works hard to accomplish her ideals. She grew up in a family composed of a mother who struggled with a lot of effort and dedication to always give her excellent principles and a good education at home as Mar\u00eda's father left her mother when he found out that she was pregnant. Since then, her mother has been of an unconditional support together with her younger stepsister, to not lose hope, and so that each day is a new beginning with all the virtues to achieving success.\r\n\r\nWhen Mar\u00eda Fernanda was 10 years old and her milk teeth were replaced with adult ones she suffered a bit as it wasn't something typical; her adult teeth were smaller and crowns that were not very aesthetic had to be put in place, making her the mockery of the school and family for a little while. This experience led to a \u2018dream\u2019, for which she is continually fighting. A dream to such an extent that she decided to pursue studies in healthcare, dentistry in particular, in order to make people happy, whether they had problems, childhood traumas as she had at one time, or simply for health or cosmetic reasons so that they could smile with pride and that they could have a new look in society.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mar\u00eda Fernanda completed her secondary school studies, and to make her dream a reality, she applied to university, failing on that attempt but with optimism she entered another university to start her professional career. At this university she studied up to the 5th semester, but once again her dream was interrupted, this time round for financial reasons. \r\n\r\nShe is a young woman who is proof of the compromise, perseverance and love for the dream that she had as a child, a dream that is now the profession and her greatest desire. She is sure that it is a vocation that is in her blood, hence why she has never tired and will continue to chase after the dream until she has made it a reality. It is for this reason that she decided to take a step back and resume her studies in the same branch but now from a technical aspect as she still does not have the financial stability with which to continue university studies.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Fernanda is currently studying at Campoalto, Oral Care, in the morning from Monday to Friday and due to the aforementioned financial instability she needs the support of Kiva, where she hopes to continue making firm steps to realizing her dream. As this is a step towards financial security that will enable her to finish her university studies, obtaining knowledge for the wellbeing of many, such as Mar\u00eda Fernanda, who look to smile at life despite the untimely difficulties presented along the way which are inherent to life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1505385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of enrollment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T15:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T15:10:19Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Fernanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392920},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069601},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882544},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201908},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":291369.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286049}],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T15:31:48Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":653589,"name":"Soka's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokha, aged 40 years old, is married and has four children, living in a rural village of the Moung Russey district of Battambang province, Cambodia.

Samphan, a fourth-time borrower, and her co-borrower, who is a first-time borrower, are in a group of two with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The past loan has enabled her to improve her living conditions better than before. Now, she and her co-borrower are seeking a loan of 1,000,000 KHR each.

The care that she gives to the patients is something that makes her feel good.

He is the only source of income for their family. Though a housewife, Lipika also helps her husband in his business, yet it is impossible for them to live life in a decent way. That\u2019s why Lipika has decided to start a business of her own. \r\n\r\nShe wants to start a bakery shop and wants to prepare breads, biscuits, etc. She needs some capital to start her business. Lipika has taken a loan from BJS to purchase necessary ingredients like flour, yeast, oil, cinnamon, sugar, baking powder and other necessary equipment to start her bakery. As it is a profitable business, she hopes it will give her greater profitability, as there are no other bakery shops in the locality. This will improve her family\u2019s financial condition.   \r\n\r\nShe gives her thanks to BJS and Kiva for the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1505321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded

She needs Kiva's help because she is poor and is also a mother and the head of her family.  Luz has two young children and does not receive financial support from their father.  Luz works as a salesperson and has a very low income. Consequently she wants to do better and have a profession in order to provide her two children with financial stability and to have a better job as a pharmacy assistant, with a fixed salary. Luz's wage as a salesperson is not enough to cover her children's and her household expenses.\r\n\r\nLuz knows that if she has a profession, she will have plenty of opportunities in order to get ahead with her children and that she will be able to give them a good upbringing.  Luz is grateful to Kiva for supporting her with her dream of becoming a professional as, when she was a child, she also did not have a father. Luz lived only with her mother and siblings and so she could not study.  She had to pay for high school herself and now she must continue to pay for her education. With no help from anyone, it is difficult for Luz to pay for such expensive studies as she must also pay her rent, utility bills, for food, and for childcare when she goes out to work.  The important things is, though, that she is making the effort to be able to study and is not doing nothing.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and for the support that you can provide to Luz.  She really does want to be a person who is of use in society and wants to be a great professional."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1505428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one semester's tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T16:50:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T16:50:26Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Dary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392925},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069606},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882549},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201913},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":291369.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286054}],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T19:27:24Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":653684,"name":"Margaret's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret, who is in her mid 30's, is married with one child who is still at school.

And here he found the possibility of a business when the suppliers offered him the opportunity to generate more income selling sea-foods. So he starts his day searching for mullet, bocachico, and mojarra (siver perch) which he sells mainly to restaurants located in the center of the city. He offers his product for cash. He works from 8 am until noon. <br \/><br \/>His goal is to open his own shop located in the most commercial area of the city of Barranquilla. Marcos plans to improve his infrastructure to respond to his growing clientele. To do this he needs a cooler to fill with the fish and sell much more in the Christmas and End of Year celebrations. At this time the consumption by customers in restaurants increases. So Marcos sells more and more, taking advantage of his Kiva loan which he is requesting in order to invest in fish and a cooler."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1496654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish and a cooler.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcos Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1040000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87600},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":93348},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96148},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99033},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102004},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105064},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108216},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111462},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114806},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":122319}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.33,"local_amount":87600,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89385.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450415499},{"amount":49.36,"local_amount":93348,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":95251.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459104635},{"amount":50.85,"local_amount":96148,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":98108.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467919543},{"amount":52.37,"local_amount":99033,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":101051.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140341},{"amount":53.95,"local_amount":102004,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":104083.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834224},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":105064,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":107205.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504260351},{"amount":241.58,"local_amount":456803,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":466115.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542627}],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T12:18:48Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:39:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":648180,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria  es una se\u00f1ora que actualmente se encuentra separada de su esposos con el que tuvo 2 hijas, vive en su casa  junto a su hija en la zona Norte de la ciudad de La Paz.

old, married, and together with her husband is bringing up six children. Toktokan is a happy mother with many children. Three sons are working abroad in Russia and they send part of their salary every month to support the family. The remaining children are school age, and in their free time help Toktokan around the homestead. Her husband manufactures national musical instruments called \"komuz\" from wood. Very few people can manufacture such instruments and Toktokan's husband is among them. He makes komuzes on order and has a small income. <br \/><br \/>Toktokan has a high school education. As a main source of income for her family, Toktokan raises livestock, having started 13 years ago with a livestock purchase of 10,000 som KGS. Thanks to the hard work of Toktokan and her children, the homestead currently has: one heifer, five sheep, and ten goats. Also on the territory of the house, Toktokan has a small garden with apple and plum trees. In the autumn after collecting the crop, Toktokan prepares jam and compotes for her family from apples and plums. And the remaining portion of fruit and berries are sold. Monthly income consists of 20,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>Toktokan has a very friendly and musical family: Toktokan's husband himself manufactures, plays and sings with the komuz and the children sign along. <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Toktokan turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan - to buy sheep to increase the livestock headcount. <br \/><br \/>Toktokan plans to invest income from the loan to further propagate the quantity of domestic animals, and plans to save money for the  construction of a new building for livestock to replace the old one."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1484396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She feels very happy to be studying this profession because she has learned a lot in her rotations and she has encountered marvelous people who have taught her. \n\nHer family consists of three siblings, her mother and a nephew. She is the youngest. Her father died 12 years ago when she was only seven years old. She suffered greatly because of the loss of her father, but she overcame it with time. Her mother sacrificed a lot to raise them, because she played the role of father and mother during a very difficult stage of their growth. However, now she does not have the finanial means to pay for her semester of school. Today they are people who are very aware of their life goals, with projects in mind to now be the ones who are helping their mother. \n\nRosa is thankful to her mother for paying for her education and supporting her in what she likes, because that is what they need to advance as a family - to give each other advice and encouragement to complete their projects. However, now she lacks the financial resources to pay this semester. Rosa wants to be a good nurse, to be recognized at work, and to stand out for what she does and how she carries herself. One of her dreams is to get to know many countries and different cultures. She also wants to study English to go and work in the United States and have economic stability. \n\nNow that Rosa does not live with her mother, she has come to realize that it is not easy. Rosa was accustomed to seeing her mother every day, but being apart has made her stronger and made her appreciate her mother more. She is more dependent on her. Rosa believes that for some people it is worrisome that their mother does not live at the house, and they think it is because of household problems. However, this is not the case. Her mother wanted her children to be more responsible for their things and the house which their father left to them. Rosa has realized that to be responsible for the house is fantastic. She can say that she has the most wonderful family because they are very unified and more dependent on each other, and she has the loveliest mother who loves them and cares for them greatly, and she hopes that this will continue for many years more.\n\nWith her technical training, Rosa will have her future secured and the satisfaction that her time was not wasted but rather well used for her personal development. She wants to continue studying this area of health because she enjoys helping other people who need her care. She thanks Kiva for helping her to be able to finish her studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1498979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to help pay for a semester of school to finish her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T17:50:51Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T17:50:51Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Estella ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":840000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":145084.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392884},{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":145084.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069565},{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":145084.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882508},{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":145084.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201872},{"amount":150,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":290169.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286013}],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T19:07:21Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie N.","image":1077468}},{"id":641278,"name":"Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandro es cliente de Kubo Financiero y esta es su historia:\n\nAlejandro se considera una persona responsable, trabajadora y humanitaria.
