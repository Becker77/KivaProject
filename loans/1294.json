Now as an adult, Hernan starts the work day at 7 AM and finishes at 3 PM. Lunches are his only product and he sells to his customers every day Monday through Saturday without exception. He buys from wholesalers in installments and sells to the employees of businesses, and his dream is to increase his income through contracts. Currently he has contacted the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to apply for a credikiva, which is the first loan he has applied for at this organization, and with it he will purchase larger quantities of ingredients like oil, rice, meat, etc. The objective is to pay for his purchases outright and not have to wait to recoup money from sales, so as to provide a better service to his customers. That's exactly why he sees a very successful outcome for his investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1505430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\r\n\r\nPius is 60 years old, married, and has five children.  He is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Pius has been a farmer for 20 years.  He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\r\n\r\nPius joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.

Because he likes being a leader and an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Pius has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved his life because he has earned more profits from his harvest, has more farm training and farm group support, and is able to save money and  feed the family.  In the future, Pius hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, and buy a cow. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Pius and the Lukwa Group will use the loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and this loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":1484217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Timothy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":187215,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187215}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2175,"local_amount":187215,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":188789.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722796}],"funded_date":"2014-01-30T00:51:18Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":641279,"name":"Carlos Ignacio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos Ignacio es cliente Kubo Financiero y esta es su historia:\n\nCarlos tiene 30 a\u00f1os y es soltero, \u00e9l se dedica al servicio de transporte en mototaxi desde hace 12 a\u00f1os. \n\n\u00c9l es due\u00f1o de 5 mototaxi que operan en una unidad habitacional, da a trabajar cuatro de esas unidades y \u00e9l opera la otra.

She was greatly benefited by her last Kiva loan, because she was able to have more capital at hand to invest. Her liquidity fluctuated, so her sales and profits increased along with the earnings of her small business and her family's income. \"God bless them so they will always keep supporting us\" are her words for the Kiva lenders. \n\nShe currently needs to attend to her customers' requests, because they are higher during the month of December and her working capital is insufficient for responding to them at this time.

She is studying to be a nurse\u2019s aide at Campo Alto; she\u2019s in her third semester.  She has already finished the theoretical portion on campus, and since December has been doing her practical training in a hospital.  This is a great opportunity, because she can be a big help and support to the patients while she goes on learning.  She chose this major because it is a lovely profession to try to help others recover and feel better just when they are going through a bad time of poor health.  In the hospital they give her the opportunity to do a lot of procedures.\n\nOne of the reasons she was motivated to study at Campo Alto was the chance they gave her to have an agreement in which she paid only a small portion of her monthly fees.  Unfortunately, the program ended and the costs are a little high for her to pay, because she doesn\u2019t have a consistent job and she has to pay the daily bus fares.  Because of this, she is asking Kiva to please give her support and allow her to belong to their program.  In this way she can keep studying and complete her dreams and goals to finish her nurse\u2019s aide program and begin the process to enter the police force.  This program is a great help because they teach you to survive every day and keep in mind that many people have problems that are worse than those that she could complain of, whether they are health problem or family problems.

She is the mother of five children.  Two of them are adults who are more involved in different activities in the field with their father.  The third attends secondary school and the two younger children attend elementary school.  Her largest source of income is the cultivation of coffee but she also works cultivating basic staple foods (corn and beans) as well as raising and fattening pigs and chickens to sell in the community.  Sometimes she makes by-products for sale from both of these products such as pork or chicken tamales, in this way generating more income to support her children and the different necessities that arise.  Her coffee crops are located a distance of 1 kilometer from her house and the family goes there together to be able to attend to the plantation. \r\n\r\nHer plans are to continue cultivating more basic staple food products like corn and beans, especially in the summer season, implementing an irrigation system, by drip or butterfly valves, which will help with the growth, maintenance and development of the products.  As a mother she wants to see her children graduate and have good careers that help their personal and family development as the economic situation in their country is not the best. \r\n\r\nSo today Ceferina is requesting financial support for the purchase of agricultural supplies like fertilizers, manure and liquid fertilizers to spray on the leaves, among other things, to be able to attend to her coffee crops since this will give better protection to the seeds and better foliage to the plants.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1505453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase agricultural supplies to attend to her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-26T10:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6066,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579541417},{"amount":425,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T10:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8593.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595663610}],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T22:53:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melanie Snellings","image":null}},{"id":641618,"name":"Jacinta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacinta is a married woman with four children.

She has four children. She describes herself as a focused and determined person. She operates a retail business where she sells milk, sugar, bread, washing soap, and other items. Her business is located in an urban area and her primary customers are local consumers. \r\n\r\nShe describes her biggest business challenge to be the low demand of products.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 69 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Isaac is pictured on the right of the Bidii Group with his hand raised.\r\n\r\nIsaac is married and has 8 children. He is 46 years old and is known as friendly, reliable, hardworking, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group and prayer group. Isaac has been a farmer for 20 years. Isaac described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Isaac\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He first joined One Acre Fund in 2009 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, Isaac also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Isaac also joined One Acre Fund because they give inputs in time. He became a group leader because he is free when needed.\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r\nIsaac plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, more farm group support, and is able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nIsaac and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":1483579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":369081,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4275,"local_amount":369081,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":370428.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722787}],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T20:37:01Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":653750,"name":"Emilia Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Emilia de 50 a\u00f1os de edad es viuda y habita en casa propia junto a su grupo familiar.

She is pictured here in a group of nine One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 83 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Robbis has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nRobbis is married and has three children. She is 27 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, prayer group and burial committee. Robbis has been a farmer for eight years.  Robbis described her harvest as good last year, but she believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Robbis\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. She first joined One Acre Fund in 2010 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds to earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.   \r\n\r\nAs an active member in her community, Robbis also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Robbis plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a cow. Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from harvest, farm training, farm group support, and the ability to save money and feed the family. Robbis\u2019 life has also improved because she has been enlightened.  \t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.

Coffee growing has been the only means of  economic income for generations and her family is no exception. Her parents taught her how to work the land at an early age. She is 35 years old and is a single mom of a daughter who attends elementary school in their neighborhood.  Florinda only completed third grade because her parents didn't have the  resources to support her.\r\n\r\nThe land that she works together with her family belongs to her, thanks to many years of hard work.  It is located 4 kilometers from her house, and she walks there accompanied by her family. Her customers are buyers who go to the region looking for the good quality product the area is known for. Despite the fact that many families earn their living from coffee growing, competition is not a problem.  Instead, they must deal with such things as insects, increases in the price of supplies, and the cost of transport. Her dreams are to increase her crop and to grow a better variety of coffee such as caturra, lempira, nance, etc. to offer to the different clients and intermediaries who come to the region. As a mother, she hopes to be able to support her daughter in her studies so that she can be better prepared academically to have more opportunities in life and have a better business sense.

She is currently studying accounting. She chose this career because she sees a great beginning for her future because it is a career of great importance. Her dream is to finish her training to be an accounting assistant and then to pursue a path in college so that she can become an accountant when she finishes. She also would like to have her own business and continue scaling it up. She'd also like in the future to have a good job so that she can help her family with all of their expenses since her parents have paid for her education as well as the education of her two siblings. She would like to help her parents as they have helped her and pay for her degree herself. \r\n\r\nMarley is also currently studying in the eleventh grade. She is studying this specialty so that she can have several chances for getting a good job when she graduates so that she can continue paying for training. That will be helpful for her because she could have a good start at any job as an accountant.\r\n\r\nShe chose this degree because it seemed very appealing for the benefits she could obtain by getting better prepared in school. When she enters college, it will be less difficult for her to understand things. She says that knowing the many things she learns in school will make it easier to understand everything to graduate and fulfill her career goals. Also, when she enters college, she hopes it will go well so she can graduate and work for what she wants. \r\n\r\nShe would like to receive this Kiva loan because it is very necessary and also helps her parents since her father works independently and provides for her brother's studies. Her brother also began his career as a public accountant in college. His father does not have much income and Marley's sister is also studying in high school paid for by her father. Her mother is a homemaker and does not earn an income and, for this reason, Marley wants to carry out her work in this career as soon as possible to be able to help her family.\r\n\r\nThank you.

company in Texas. His job involved literally transforming barren fields into green space and he took what he learned to start a small urban farm in his backyard.  When his wife\u2019s job brought their family to San Diego, they chose to live in the rural countryside, allowing Hernan to take his farming venture to the next level.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe always wanted to be close to nature, raise our kids in nature, and be self-sufficient through growing our own food,\u201d shared Hernan. \u201cIt\u2019s empowering to be able to produce something and provide for others, instead of consuming without participation.\u201d\r\n\r\nHernan launched Solidarity Farms, growing all sorts of seasonal vegetables and selling fresh produce and eggs at the entrance of the farm.  He also participates in a community supported agriculture program in which his farm weekly delivers $25 boxes of produce to members of the program.  All this ultimately supports Hernan\u2019s vision of building a vibrant food system that primarily supports local producers.  Furthermore, Hernan is passionate about helping others consume whole and healthy foods.  \r\n\r\n\u201cI grew up watching my grandparents grow their food in their farm. They would not eat anything without knowing where it was coming from,\u201d shared Hernan. \u201cThey lived long lives, working well into their 70s. That childhood memory inspired my business.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the sole farmer on his farm, Hernan is always looking for ways to increase efficiency.  He recently expanded his property from 3\/4 of an acre to 5 acres and needs a tractor to help him scale up his operations.  He will use his $5,000 Kiva loan to purchase a tractor, allowing him to bring his business to the next level.\r\n\r\nHernan\u2019s dream is ultimately to build a thriving farm that produces healthy food for his community and educates others on the value of farming.  He shared, \u201cI want to awaken a passion in others to become farmers. What is more gratifying than healing people with food?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the picture are Hernan, his wife Lisa, and their three

Como madre de familia apoyar a sus hijos en sus metas y decisiones pero sobre todo en sus estudios ya que es la mejor herencia que ella considera puede dejar a ellos.\npor lo que hoy d\u00eda Teresa solicita financiamiento para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas como abono, foliares, formula cafetalera, entre otros que aran que sus cultivos den una buena producci\u00f3n y tengan el cuidado necesario para que esto sea posible.      \n","en":"Teresa is 44 years old and has a 5th grade education.  She is married and together with her husband they work in agriculture. Their five children help take care of the coffee crops every day by doing such things as clearing, applying fertilizer, and harvesting the beans, among other things that help maintain their crops.  She has been involved in coffee growing since she was very young as she comes from a family who has worked in agriculture, and it was her parents who taught her to work the land and the skills involved. Her customers are the local bodegas, buyers who come to the region, neighbors and friends who resell the product, as well as some family members. But her priority are the bodegas because they buy at the best price.\r\n\r\nShe has many plans but her goals are to increase her coffee crops and plant a better variety of coffee that is more attractive and competitive. This will generate more income for her family. As the mother of a family she wants to support her children in their goals and decisions, but especially in their studies which is the best legacy she thinks she can leave to them. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons Teresa is asking for a loan so she can buy agricultural supplies such as manure, leaf fertilizers, coffee formula, among other things that will allow her to provide the necessary care for her plants so that they yield a good crop.

Shitawa has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative, and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nShitawa is married and has four children. She is 35 years old, and is known as trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group.  Shitawa has been a farmer for four years.  Shitawa described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\t\r\nShitawa joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Shitawa joined One Acre Fund so that she could get new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and send her children to school.  Because she wants to help more farmers, Shitawa has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and a Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Shitawa's life because she has more farm training. Shitawa hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school.  \r\n\r\nShitawa and the Amkeni Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1484174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":5200,"lender_count":156,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shitawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wanamgeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Risper","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":449316,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449316}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5200,"local_amount":449316,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":451359.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722801}],"funded_date":"2014-01-09T01:34:11Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":641698,"name":"Mokhtar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mokhtar is a 35-year-old married woman.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Chepsahani\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Chepsahani, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mary has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Monica, Jengo, Violet and Aggrey.\n\nChepsahani village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

Susan wants to be a promoter because she believes it is her duty to assist her community for the better. She believes that the dispenser will help to prevent waterborne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Susan\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T01:20:38Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T01:20:38Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Timinah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-08T01:22:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":632443,"name":"Wuilmer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jackeline es una mujer emprendedora de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, originaria de la Regi\u00f3n del Pacifico de Nicaragua, desde hace 15 a\u00f1os vende diversos productos en Puerto Cabezas.

He is involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Davit was unable to study a professional career. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing potatoes. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. In addition, they own 2 cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. As the family has only seasonal income, Davit decided to start his own stable business and seek for credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Davit's application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 2500 Gel for purchasing a minibus. As the minibus is purchased he will get orders to transport cargo to different destinations and increase the income of his family.

Though he has been working hard, he can't meet his customers' requirements due to limited capital, as wholesalers require cash payment to provide him grocery supplies. \r\n\r\nHe managed to attract more clients. He was happy about attracting new clients, but on the other hand, the financial challenge of meeting customers' demand is hindering his business progress and growth. So, he took out a loan of 200,000 YER (Yemen rials) in order to purchase grocery supplies that his shop needs.

With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future, she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Kawempe Muslim has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to sufficient clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood. Installing this water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1,000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nKawempe Muslim will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Bruhane ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of students that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1466292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T10:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T10:40:05Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kawempe School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3039000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":759750},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":759750},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":759750},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":759750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":759750,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":773729.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439748964},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":759750,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":773729.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459122589},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":759750,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":773729.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504280512},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":759750,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":773729.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579593868}],"funded_date":"2013-12-05T18:03:27Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:46:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":642243,"name":"Joel Christian","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Jo\u00ebl est un homme  \u00e2g\u00e9e de 31 ans, c\u00e9libataire sans enfants.

Jamal and her family all work hard to harvest and store fodder for their animals.\r\n\r\nTo continue to develop her farm, Jamal is seeking a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners to buy some more cows.  She plans on using any extra money that the loan will allow her to make to continue to buy more livestock, as well as to set aside money for home repairs.

This damaged her otherwise excellent sweet chilis and caused a loss in profits for Erika, her family, and everyone else who did everything they could to strengthen the crops with this loan.  Erika's first loan helped a great deal in supporting her crops but with damage done to three fifths of the land she had planted on, the crop could not be saved.  As a result, Erika was only able to sell part of her yield and so she had difficulties paying back her loan, after she lost some 70% of her cash and crops.  However, Erika still tried to keep her payments up to date and she has been without an income during this time.  Now, Erika is back at COMIXMUL, where she was first supported with previous loans. More dedicated than ever, Erika is applying for another loan.  However, following the losses with her last product, Erika has decided to grow corn and fulfil her promises to make her repayments.

","en":"Asliddin was born in a village. He is a honest and decent man. Asliddin is 32 years old. He is married and raising three children. Asliddin is the main bread-winner in the family, as his wife is a housewife and raises the children. Asliddin lives together with his parents. His parents are old. \r\n\r\nLike the other residents of the village, Asliddin works with livestock breeding. He has worked in this business for eight years already.

Her husband owns a butcher shop in the main market which is the only source of income for their family. His monthly net income is insufficient to meet the family needs. Presently, he needs an additional capital to purchase bull calf to get meat. \r\n\r\nFor that reason his wife, Rehana, as member of 2-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband. As their family expenditures are too much, as compared to the monthly income and savings. Rehana wants to open a new shop for her husband, with the profit amount. As a result of this, they can increase their monthly income as well as savings. Her dreams are for higher education for her children.

design, because her mom gave her a toy sewing machine. With this she created the first dresses for her dolls. She earned scoldings because as she grew up, she would take apart her shirts and re-sew them, giving them her personal touch.\r\n\r\nWith these skills she thinks that it is her door to keep moving up and making her dreams come true little by little.  She can go on learning more about the subject in order to come to be a designer of excellence.  She can be proud for her family who have always supported her and given her a push to get ahead and reach her goals.\r\n\r\nIn five or ten years she sees herself launching her own line of women\u2019s clothing, and in this way making jobs and pushing other people who want to start their own companies.  She would like styles that show off the beauty of the world, because her country offers a lot of inspiration in its people, as well as in nature.\r\n\r\nShe chose this major because she knows that more than making clothing, she is creating valuable ideas that can give fashion a new point of view for all types of people.

She has two children, and they manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLeovigilda operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 11,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nLeovigilda dreams of expanding her business, and hopes to have a beautiful life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1484930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
