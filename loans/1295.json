She is married to Marcial and together they have three children who are 16, 9 and 3 years old. They have their own home but are currently living with Jessi's mother in law. Jessi works very hard to provide her family with a better quality of life. Jessi works selling regional fruits, including bananas, yucca, coconuts, banana leaves, limes and others. The quantity of each fruit that she sells depends on the season, since there are times of the year when some of these products are scarce and others when they are plentiful. Jessi has a market stall in one of the city's main markets, and given the number of people who attend this market each day she has strong sales. She has had this business for 5 years, and has worked alone the whole time. She really enjoys her work since she feels free and independent, and since she earns a decent living it allows her not to worry too much. \r\n\r\nJessi's goal is to expand her business and begin to sell her produce in bulk in other cities. This would increase her income considerably. She is currently asking for a loan of 1,600 Soles. She is a very responsible borrower, committed to her lending group, and she is grateful to those lenders who allow her to continue developing her business. With the loan requested, she will buy more bananas, coconuts and oranges to continue her work. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1484818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruit such as bananas, coconuts and oranges","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":240.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":243.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":265.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":275.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":280.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":294.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.57,"local_amount":240.88,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-05T09:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":242.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439778555},{"amount":87.49,"local_amount":243.45,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":244.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598957},{"amount":95.39,"local_amount":265.44,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":267.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147823},{"amount":98.95,"local_amount":275.34,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":277.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240921},{"amount":100.68,"local_amount":280.15,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-04T11:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":281.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258360},{"amount":105.92,"local_amount":294.74,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-01T11:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":296.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491502430}],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T15:22:03Z","paid_date":"2015-05-01T11:04:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kaitlyn  Godfrey","image":null}},{"id":641955,"name":"Ma.

Chemojech village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from an unprotected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Victor and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nVictor works as a business owner, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Victor and other promoters in his community (including Mary, Herenita and Enock) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Victor will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Victor wants to be a promoter because he sees it as a project that will help the community. Victor believes that the dispenser will prevent water-borne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.

Hezron and other promoters in his community (including: Josina, Nichodemas and Rose) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Hezron  will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. He wants to be a promoter because he is trusted by community members and this waterpoint is in on his piece of land so he wants to take care of it. Hezron believes that the dispenser will prevent waterborne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

Vihiga, Kenya, has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser. She has 5 children and lives with her family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor and an iron roof.\n\nGamuguywa village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from an unprotected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Phanice and the 10 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nPhanice has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Phanice volunteered to be the promoter because she wants to represent  her community on the kiva website and she also wants to help the community access safe water. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Solomon, Joseline and Miriam.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Phanice\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1481684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T18:20:05Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phanice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solomon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":71,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-09T15:45:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":640033,"name":"Philis' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philis lives in Bushigunga B village in Vihiga, Kenya with her family which includes 7 children (6 sons and a daughter). The community of Bushigunga B village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Bushigunga B\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Bushigunga B, 25 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Philis has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

All the children are students. Osuipa has higher education, both she and her husband work at the local school as teachers of physics and mathematics. They both have analytic minds. They have raised more than one generation of school children. \r\n\r\nAs a main income for the family, Osuipa works with livestock breeding, after having started 17 years ago with the purchase of 9,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her persistent work, her farm currently has four dairy cows, four horses and 25 sheep. They have the necessary conditions for breeding livestock. Osuipa at the same time conducts veterinary vaccination as a preventive measure. The whole family helps with the business. They harvest fodder at their own plot of land.

He is a very hardworking and energetic man. He began his working life in the field, as he he was born into a family in the countryside that taught him all about caring for animals and growing crops. As a result, for many years he worked in agriculture, alternating his work with the sale of snack foods, liquor, sodas, and other products, which he sold to supplement his income. After about 20 years, he came to the city due to the armed conflict and extorsion from criminal gangs that he faced where he previously lived and worked. He was forced to pay the gangs a monthly fee just to be left alone to do his job. Instead, he decided to move and start a general store. He receives help from his wife who manages the store while he works construction jobs on the side. Working together, they have managed to support their family and help their children despite all the difficulties life has presented. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Jorge is asking for a loan to buy goods for his general store (snack foods, sweets, rice, sugar, coffee, cookies, milk, meat, and other basic goods). This will allow him to diversify his inventory and satisfy his clients' demands, which always increases towards the end of the year. He will earn more income with which he will support his family's well-being and continue to invest in his business. As it grows, his main goal is for it to be converted into a small supermarket that will generate employment opportunities for others and guarantee his family economic stability. He would like to provide the best education for his children, and enjoy the best quality of life possible alongside those he loves.

Thanks to his father's dedication to his work as a salesman, as well as the support of his mother, Wilber studied Physical Engineering at the National University of Columbia. He graduated with honors. Wilber's dream is to get his Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering in Europe, but to do so he needs the support of Kiva to help cover the expenses for entrance exams and application fees. Wilber hopes to return to Colombia with his degree, to work on aerospace projects in his country. \r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Although my family supports my dream, my parents are unable to cover the high costs it entails due to our limited financial situation. Currently, I am working as a teacher of algebra, physics and calculus in a local high school. At the same time, I am working with the \"Colombian Astronautics Association\" developing hydraulic rockets with my high school students. The money I am earning will be used to cover my living expenses while I study. For this reason, I need Kiva's help to get over the first hurdle in this long journey of studying abroad. I do not want to give up on this dream, and I know that I will be successful because of my prior academic success and the effort I will put into my future studies. \r\n\r\nThe development of experimental space technologies quickly became one of my biggest passions. I have always been interested in science, and find it very exciting to be part of a world where there is always something new to discover. Stimulating science knowledge in others, especially in children, is one of the reasons why I would like to get my Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering abroad. The challenge of living with another language, in another culture, is one that I would love to take on in order to broaden my horizons. In the future, I wish to create a technology company that will contribute to the development of my country. This is a great opportunity for me to continue my career and increase my professional opportunities. I will give everything I have to complete my dream. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1484845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to finance the aplication costs for a Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"La Dorada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":177.81,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2650000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":220833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":220833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.23,"local_amount":220833.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-11T10:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":221631.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.35,"payment_id":610534947},{"amount":91.38,"local_amount":220833.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":221631.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.21,"payment_id":624206379},{"amount":95.39,"local_amount":220833.33,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":221631.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.19,"payment_id":636192541},{"amount":908.19,"local_amount":1987500.01,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1994680.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":123.06,"payment_id":650529941}],"funded_date":"2013-12-09T20:54:05Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kaitlyn  Godfrey","image":null}},{"id":642982,"name":"Mable's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mable lives in a home with mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof in Jivudavaji village in Vihiga, Kenya with her husband and 8 sons. The community of Jivudavaji village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Jivudavaji\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Jivudavaji, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mable has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Pamela and Stephen. \n\nJivudavaji village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Mable believes that the dispenser will help prevent waterborne diseases. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Mable\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1481850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mable ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":71,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-06T20:42:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":641913,"name":"Braulia Nohemy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Braulia, tiene 25 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera, vive con sus padres en el municipio de San Marcos, Santa B\u00e1rbara.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Joyce and the 22 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nJoyce has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Joyce volunteered to be the promoter because she is involved in developmental projects and she wants to help the community by making water safe. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Grace, Maguli, Abraham, and Mariam.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Ikonza A\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Ikonza A, 14 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Morine has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Luka and Enos. \n\nIkonza A village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

She was accepted into the Universidad P\u00fablica de el Alto and plans on graduating in May 2014. \r\n\r\nMaria plans on using the loan to pay her graduation fee. This fee is often more expensive than the semester's tuition and is a frequent impediment for graduating students in El Alto. Without financial assistance, she thinks that she may need to take time off to work and save until she can return to school. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her responsibilities at school, Maria currently works 25 hours a week and earns $9 a day.

Here is his story:\r\n\r\nAt the age of 16 I applied to the Future Leaders Exchange scholarship program. There were a lot of students from my region. It was the hardest competition I have ever faced. Finally, after all tests and interviews, they said that I won scholarship for an exchange program. I was so proud to go as representative of my country to share our cultural values with the people of America. I learned a new culture and this whole new world was opened to me. Everything was new and bizarre. I couldn't understand why people were using two garbage bins. My host mother explained to me that they recycle papers and cans. By recycling them they can reuse those same materials in the future. I wanted to find out more about recycling. Fortunately, my coordinator had a friend who was working in this field. We arranged a meeting. He showed me a factory where they were recycling paper. I was amazed by this place. We had a long conversation about recycling. He said that seventy-five percent of trash can be recycled without any chemicals and harm to the environment. But the main problem was how to manage a factory and efficiently use resources. Because of that I made it my goal to become a manager of recycling business.\r\n\r\nAfter that day I started to think a lot about where I can find this knowledge. I had several ideas about applying to business schools in America but they were unaffordable for me and they were far away from my home country. Then I found out about American University in Central Asia which was one the best universities in whole region. When I was in Bishkek I had always heard about how AUCA students volunteered to help in communities through site cleans-ups, helping orphans, and helping homeless people. I always wanted to be one of them. Educationally, the university's programs were the best in Kyrgyzstan.They could provide me the knowledge which could help me to achieve my future goals. I want to gain experience and knowledge from studying in this university to make my future and the future of my country cleaner."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1485008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Now, Tojiniso is able to start a business and become successful in this area. \r\n\r\nTojiniso would like to start a business sewing women's clothing, since she has experience in this type of service.

Two family members are drivers by trade and provide transportation services by using  the same three-wheeled rickshaw. Her husband drives their auto rickshaw in the daytime and her son drives it at night. They have been continuously driving a single rickshaw for many years to meet the family's expenses, but now it requires proper maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Parveen has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, for the maintenance of their rickshaw. Her husband wants to buy new tires and do little bit of engine maintenance for the vehicle. This will help them drive more smoothly and provide better transport service to their passengers. She is hopeful that this loan will be a productive one for her family and will bring positive changes to their business.\r\n\r\nParveen thanks Kiva and field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1484301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy new tires and do maintenance on their auto rickshaw.

With the passage of time inflation is increasing prices day by day but the sources of income remain constant. To increase income he wants to turn his enterprise towards progress. \r\n\r\nFor the purchasing of fruit he does not have a sufficient amount; he tried to borrow some money from his friends and relatives but nobody helped him. Therefore, Sumera requested a loan for her husband so that her husband would be able to buy additional fruit to sell at evening.

Ikrom loves his family more than anything and tries his best to provide for them.  As the breadwinner in the family, he is obligated to provide his wife and children with food, education, and medical treatment.\r\n\r\nIkrom is currently working in a passport office in J.Rumy, but would like to start raising livestock to earn some extra money on the side.  He feels he needs to borrow $3000 in addition to what he's already saved in order to get started, which is really not a whole lot of money when you consider how much it costs to buy livestock.  Ikrom understands that it won't be easy to be a successful livestock farmer, but remains undaunted by potential hardships, and will move forward with his plans, come what may.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"buy bull calves and set up a new livestock-raising business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rumy","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-12-05T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-03T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ikrom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":221.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":226.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":231},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":236.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":241.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":246.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":252.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":257.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":263.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":269.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":280.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":642481,"name":"Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eduardo tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa en el distrito de La Matanza, una comunidad tranquila que se caracteriza por sus bosques de algarrobos, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda a dos horas de la ciudad  de Piura, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nEl se dedica a la venta de ganado vacuno y caprino desde hace cinco a\u00f1o, cuenta con clientela fija en la zona, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 2 000 nuevos soles para la compra de ovejas y una segunda parte para la compra de alimentos balanceados, lo que le permitir\u00e1 tener una mejor producci\u00f3n para ofrecer a sus clientes y de esta manera generar mayores ingresos para su familia.\n\n","en":"Eduardo, 38, lives with his wife in La Matanza district, a tranquil community that is characterized by its carob tree forests.

","en":"This is Gavhar, a young 22-year-old seamstress from Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan.  Gavhar lives there with her parents, two brothers and younger sister, and has yet to be married.  She first started working as a seamstress at the start of 2010, and, as such, has been at it for more than 3 years.  She works out of her home together with her mother, and specializes in Tajikistani folk apparel for women.  In addition to making women's clothes, she is also studying as a distance-learning student at a university specializing in agriculture, and is paying for her tuition out of pocket.  \r\n\r\nGavhar feels the time is right to start expanding her business.  She is requesting a loan to buy a modern computerized sewing machine, as well as some additional fabrics for sewing.  With the help of this new sewing machine, she'll be able to make more intricate patterns on her dresses.  Naturally, such dresses will command a higher price and allow her to earn more money, bringing her one step closer to realizing her future plans of opening her own sewing

She also likes her work at the bank and, once she has her degree, she would like to branch out in other areas of her current job, such as the marketing department.  \r\n\r\nCarolina's income is not very high.  Her parents live in the country and they cannot currently support her financially as they have few resources.

Salome has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nSalome is 43 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years.  Salome works as a farmer to provide for her five children.  The community and other farmers know Salome as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community activities such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and the burial committee.  Salome described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Salome\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  She first joined One Acre Fund in 2009 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed her family and to send her children to school.  As an active member in her community, Salome also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Salome plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from the harvest, more farm training, is able to save money and feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Salome and the Apokor SHG Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":1485096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T00:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T00:20:13Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makholo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":406524,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406524}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4700,"local_amount":406524,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":407959.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722802}],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T07:37:35Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":642082,"name":"Chapakazi A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chapakazi A is a Nuru International group of five farmers in the Kuria West District in Kenya.

dif\u00edcil, pero esto no fue impedimento para que la mama le diera una buena educaci\u00f3n, que fue la primaria y bachillerato, que es lo m\u00e1s indispensable, pero el desde que empez\u00f3 a conocer lo relacionado con los computadores lo que m\u00e1s quer\u00eda era estudiar algo relacionado con los computadores, pero cuando sali\u00f3 del colegio lo que mas quer\u00eda le toco aplazar y le toco empezar a trabajar para de esta forma poder ayudarle a la mama con todo lo de la casa, pero la mejor forma era trabajar para ayudar con los gastos de la casa, esto por varios a\u00f1os, y a medida que pasaban los a\u00f1os la mama empezaba a requerir de  mas descanso por la edad, pero para el lo m\u00e1s importante era la mama por m\u00e1s que quisiera estudiar lo que m\u00e1s le gustaba ten\u00eda que seguir aplaz\u00e1ndolo por que si quer\u00eda estudiar de d\u00f3nde sacaba para los gastos de la casa, por tal motivo segu\u00eda trabajando en lo que saliera a si le gustara todo lo relacionado con los computadores, y muchas personas le daban animo pero con el animo es muy dif\u00edcil lograrlo hace falta plata que es lo que uno m\u00e1s quiere para lograrlo, desafortunada-mente ninguno de los dos tenia apoyo de nadie para lograrlo y lo que ellos ganaban no alcanzaba para todos las cosas que ten\u00edan que pagar, como son arriendo, comida y vestuario y mas que los dos eran solos era muy dif\u00edcil y para sacar un pr\u00e9stamo piden muchas cosas y de d\u00f3nde sacarlas para pagar el pr\u00e9stamo, ser\u00eda otro problema que no estaba dentro de los alcances que unas personas como ricardo y la mama podr\u00edan hacerlo, por eso lo \u00fanico que les quedaba a los dos era trabajar y esperar que mas delante de alguna forma se presentara la forma de que ricardo pudiera estudiar a si fuera en un largo tiempo, porque estudiando podr\u00eda ganar m\u00e1s plata y trabajar en lo que le gustaba, por que cuando una persona est\u00e1 mejor preparada puede aspirar a tener un mejor nivel de vida, porque es lo que el siempre quiere para tener un futuro mejor, ricardo trabajo en muchas cosas incluso en una ocasi\u00f3n le sali\u00f3 un buen trabajo relacionado con los computadores, no lo pudo realizar por no tener ning\u00fan certificado que lo relacionara con una universidad o con algo que lo pudiera ayudar, porque en una ocasi\u00f3n trabajo con una empresa realizando mantenimiento para computadores, pero esto no era suficiente para que le dieran dicho trabajo esto lo desanimo pero no era para mas si el quer\u00eda trabajar con los computadores y poder darle un mejor futuro a su mama y por falta de estudio no lo pod\u00eda, lograr de esta forma, lo \u00fanico que se pod\u00eda era seguir trabajando y esperar la oportunidad que se sab\u00eda que en alg\u00fan momento se presentar\u00eda, pero para esto paso un largo tiempo, pero ricardo manten\u00eda esta esperanza muy viva porque siempre lo hab\u00eda tenido muy presente en sus metas por lograr, aun que la mama de ricardo tambi\u00e9n quer\u00eda que su hijo pudiera estudiar para tener un mejor nivel en su educaci\u00f3n era un poco dif\u00edcil con lo poco que ganaban por que si ricardo estudiaba de donde pagaban el arriendo y la comida y las dem\u00e1s cosas que uno tiene que pagar en la vida, pero ricardo no perd\u00eda nunca las esperanzas de lograrlo, por que cuando una persona se pone metas en la vida siempre las logra a si sea en un tiempo determinado, pero el segu\u00eda trabajando muy juicioso para darle  a su mama mas alegr\u00edas que era tener un sitio donde vivir y lo que se requer\u00eda para comer, hace una a\u00f1o ricardo empez\u00f3 a  mirar donde pod\u00eda estudiar pero los costos de todos eran  muy altos y el presupuesto era muy bajo pero el no se desanimo si no sigui\u00f3 buscando.\nBusco uno que fuera cerca de donde vive para no tener que pagar transporte, cuando ten\u00eda formas entraba a Internet o buscaba caminando cuando ten\u00eda tiempo,  a si fue cuando un d\u00eda llegando a la casa encontr\u00f3 un volante que ten\u00eda una informaci\u00f3n de una parte donde pod\u00eda estudiar y al d\u00eda siguiente se fue con su mama para averiguar los costos y los horarios para mirar si pod\u00eda estudiar, le dieron toda la informaci\u00f3n que requer\u00eda, lo que m\u00e1s le gusto fue que ten\u00edan un convenio donde las cuotas le pod\u00edan salir m\u00e1s baratas y esto era mucho mejor para el presupuesto que tenia ricardo.\nNecesito del convenio con kiva para que las cuotas le salgan m\u00e1s baratas y de esta forma poderse ahorrar m\u00e1s plata, porque a el le hace falta para otras cosas, por eso quiere tener la ayuda del convenio kiva. \n\nMuchas Gracias \n","en":"Ricardo had a very hard life after his mother was left alone when Ricardo's father was killed.  This didn't stop his mother from giving him a good education, however.  He finished elementary school and high school, which are the most indispensable.\r\n\r\nOnce Ricardo began learning about computers, what he most wanted was to study something in that field.  When he got out of high school, however, he had to put this aside and start working to be able to help his mother at home.  The best way to do this was to help with the household expenses for several years.  And as the years went by, his mother began to need more rest because of her age.  For Ricardo, his mother was always the most important thing.\r\n\r\nAs much as he wanted to study what he most enjoyed, he had to keep on postponing it because he didn't have money for the household expenses if he was studying.  This is why he kept on working at whatever he could get, although he liked everything having to do with computers.  A lot of people encouraged him but it's difficult with encouragement.  What's needed is money; money is what one needs most to achieve this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, neither of them had support from anyone to achieve this.  What they earned wasn't enough for everything they needed to pay for, such as rent, food, and clothing.  And more than this, the two of them were alone.  It was very difficult.  To get a loan, they ask for a lot of things and where they're going to get them to pay back the loan.  That was another problem--that it wasn't within the reach of people like Ricardo and his mother to do it.  The only thing they could do was work and hope that later something would come up so Ricardo could go to school.\r\n\r\nThat's the way it was for a long time, because by going to school he would be able to earn more money and work at what he enjoyed.  When someone is better educated he can aspire to have a better standard of living, because it's what he always wants so he can have a better future.\r\n\r\nRicardo worked a lot of jobs.  Once a good job working with computers came up, but he couldn't do it because he didn't have a certificate from a university or something that could help.\r\n\r\nOnce he worked with a business doing computer maintenance but it wasn't enough for them to give him a job, which was discouraging.  He wanted to work with computers and be able to give his mother a better future, and for lack of an education he couldn't do that.  The only thing he could do was keep on working and waiting for the opportunity he knew would arise.\r\n\r\nA lot of time went by but Ricardo kept hoping, because he had always kept in mind his goals.  His mother also wanted him to go to school to improve his educational level.  It was difficult with what little money he earned, because if he was in school, they didn't have money for the rent, food, and the other things one needs in life.\r\n\r\nRicardo never lost hope because when people have goals in life they always achieve them within a determined amount of time.  He kept on working judiciously to make his mother happy and give her food and a place to live.\r\n\r\nA year ago Ricardo began to look into where he could go to school, but the costs were very high everywhere and his budget was very low. But rather than losing hope, he kept on looking.  He looked for a school that was near where he lives so he wouldn't have to pay for transportation.  He looked on the Internet when he was able or, when he had time, he looked while he was walking.\r\n\r\nOne day one the way home Ricardo found a flyer with information about a place he could study, and the next day went with his mother to verify the costs and schedules to see if he would be able to study there.  They gave him all the information he needed.  What Ricardo liked most was that they had an agreement with lower payments, which was better for his budget.\r\n\r\nRicardo needs the agreement with Kiva so his payments will be lower and he'll be able to save more money.  He also needs money for other things, so he wants to have the help of  the Kiva loan.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1505397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay his tuition for a semester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-05T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392921},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069602},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882545},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201909},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":291369.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286050}],"funded_date":"2014-01-05T16:19:22Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":642077,"name":"Penh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Penh is 43 years old.

He is pictured here in a group of four One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of twenty-nine individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Japheth has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nJapheth is married and has nine children.  He is 66-years-old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community, in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and the burial committee.  Japheth has been a farmer for thirty-six years.  Japheth described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nJapheth first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season.  Japheth joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader. He is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Japheth plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Japheth\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, is able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and pass the cost savings onto the farmers.  Japheth and the Jitetee S.H.G Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1484328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":" to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T00:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T00:40:01Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Japheth","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zablon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":219309,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219309}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2550,"local_amount":219309,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":221339.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722803}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T03:55:01Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":642511,"name":"Rosilene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosilene is 33 and married, and has always lived in Sorocaba-SP.

In their spare time, they like to enjoy the company of their families, and they prepare typical dishes such as \"indio viejo\" (a Nicaraguan corn stew) for them.

She very much likes everything related to health, and her dream is to be a psychiatrist.  But the process is long: first she has to study medicine, and then psychology, and she does not have the means to study medicine. So, like many people, she will have to start at the bottom and work her way up little by little, until she realizes her ultimate dream of becoming an excellent psychiatrist. \r\n\r\nAlthough fulfilling this dream may be difficult and take a long time, a person must have a dream in order to have hopes and goals, so she will be a nursing assistant for now, as she does not have the economic means to pay for this degree.  Her parents are separated, and she lives with her mother, who is a stylist.  Her stepfather helps them, because her father, although working, has a lot of expenses and cannot help them at the moment.  She works as a waitress in an asadero (a barbecue restaurant that serves a variety of grilled meats, poultry, and other regional dishes). This way, she plans on paying her tuition, but she is a realistic person, and she knows that this is not a long-term job. And, because she is not yet legally of age, she won't be able find work that is permanent and secure. \r\n\r\nWhat she wants most is to continue studying, as education is the way to overcome ignorance and poverty, and she knows that there is something important out there for her. This is why she wants to continue to study, and she needs the agreement with Kiva; a Kiva loan would help her very much.\r\n\r\nShe knows that by working, even as a dishwasher, she will manage to complete her studies, and she knows it won't be easy. But she is also aware that if she doesn't fight, she cannot turn her dreams into reality. She already has her high-school diploma and she already has one semester of nursing studies. She knows that she can continue to move forward, but not alone. People don't move forward alone; there is always support from someone, either moral or economic. She has moral support, and she is asking Kiva for economic support. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the opportunity that Kiva lenders are giving to her and to other young people. Not only are they investing in young people, but also in the future.  With better work in Colombia, there will be support for people who want to move forward, and for their endeavors, a dream that is impossible for many. \r\n\r\nShe promises that anything invested in her, be it time or money, will not be wasted. She is not perfect, but she is very persistent, and she does not give up easily.  She will fight and fight until she is a complete professional.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1505742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester's tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-05T04:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T04:10:05Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulley Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":145260,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392931},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":145260.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069612},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":145260,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882555},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":145260,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201919},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":290520.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286060}],"funded_date":"2014-01-05T06:22:17Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":639232,"name":"Sarxan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarxan is 28 years old, married, and living with his parents and wife in the Baku region.

experienced farmer.  He has been involved in growing vegetables, which is the most profitable business in his village, for 20 years.  Over this period of time, he built several greenhouses, where he grows radishes and tomatoes.  Victor is certain that success is dependent on his hard work and this is why he invests all of his strengths and means into developing the business.  His family - wife and children - are good helpers.  Suddenly, Victor received an offer to purchase land near his house.  Victor requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 hryvnia.  This is a good opportunity to expand his business because this land already has two greenhouses, and Victor will be able to plant more tomatoes there in the spring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4875,"image":{"id":1483134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a plot with two green houses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T04:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T04:40:01Z","loan_amount":4875,"lender_count":151,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1473.41,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1698.82,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20048.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":738.68,"payment_id":530043515},{"amount":1702.77,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20048.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":734.73,"payment_id":542536307}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T00:09:13Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T13:54:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":639572,"name":"Nurida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nurida is a seller.

Like any man, he loves his family and always tries to provide his wife and children with decent living conditions, food, education and good health.  Nazirjon raises livestock; he has a cow which gives milk to his children.

Munarbek has a secondary education. As the main source of income for his family, Munarbek practices livestock breeding. He started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Munarbek's hard work, he currently has 1 mare, 4 sheep, and 5 goats on his farm, as well as a garden in which he grows apples and plums. After gathering his harvest, Munarbek sells these apples and plums on the market to wholesale buyers. His harvest brings in a small profit. In his spare time, Munarbek also works as a taxi driver, offering his taxi services to the local population. His monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

Concepta has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the left wearing a blue and white blouse.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\n\nConcepta is married and has 6 children.  She is 34 years old and is known as being friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Concepta has been a farmer for 13 years. She described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\n\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Concepta\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  She first joined One Acre Fund in 2009 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed the family and send children to school.  As an active member in her community, Concepta also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes to lead, wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Concepta plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from harvest, farm training, farm group support, and is able to save money and feed the family.\t\n\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Concepta and the Engila Ndala Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":1484134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":4750,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Centrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":411873,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411873}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4750,"local_amount":411873,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":412299.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722790}],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T20:01:07Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":642135,"name":"Innocent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Innocent, 37 years old, would like to use his Kiva loan to support labor costs and to buy fertilizers during maize production.

The members joined the group to acquire skills and knowledge on improved farming methods. They are able to obtain loans through Nuru to acquire farm inputs. As a group, the members of Inuka collectively guarantee the loan.\nSophia who is raising up her hand is the leader of this group. She is married with three children. She has been a member of this group for three years now. \nThe loan from Kiva will enable her acquire hybrid seeds and fertilizer which will enable her to realize a bountiful harvest.

He is pictured here in a group of six One Acre Fund group-leader farmers. (The field officer is also in the photo, standing on the left). The group leaders represent 51 individual farmers, who are not pictured here. \r\n\r\nJoseph has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative. He is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving a quarter acre of maize and a quarter acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJoseph is married and has eight children. He is 70 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Joseph has been a farmer for 34 years. He describes last year's harvest as excellent but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nJoseph first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season. He joined One Acre Fund for several reasons: to get the best seed prices as well as fertilizer and hybrid seeds; to learn new farming methods; and to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nJoseph plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for the farmers. His own life was improved because he had more profits from his harvest, more farm training and more group support and was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Joseph and the Ngachi Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. The organization continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3825,"image":{"id":1484406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet and sorghum seeds. \t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T13:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T13:00:15Z","loan_amount":3825,"lender_count":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Macline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":331638,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331638}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3825,"local_amount":331638,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":332009.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722804}],"funded_date":"2014-02-02T21:13:13Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":642139,"name":"Ali Yusuf","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali Yusuf, 30 years old, is married and has three children.

Now she wants to help her father by increasing the inventory in his mini-market with a larger quantity of food products in order to raise his sales and profit. Because he doesn't have enough money to do this himself, she has applied for this youth loan.

Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs and their children's education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRowena dreams to buy another jeepney and hire a driver. She hopes that her family will have a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members each week to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nCuriously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 50 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Zakaria is pictured on the right of the Baraka Group with his hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nZakaria is married and has 5 children.  He is 35 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking and, trustworthy.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and savings group.  Zakaria has been a farmer for 20 years.  Zakaria described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nZakaria first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Zakaria joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  He is an active community member.  Zakaria plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Zakaria\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, and was able to save money.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Zakaria and the Baraka Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":1484535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T13:20:04Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zakaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sifrose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":315591,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315591}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3650,"local_amount":315591,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":316710.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722805}],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T02:37:23Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":642145,"name":"Al-Tsamoh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Al-Tsamoh group consists of four women from Aden, Yemen.

She works at the business from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., seven days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nAminata requires a loan in order to purchase more items like cigarettes, biscuits, drinks and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and repay her loans. In the future, Aminata plans to own the biggest shop in the community.
