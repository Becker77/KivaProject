In her spare time she likes to be with her family spending quality time. Unfortunately due to modest finances she could not continue her studies. Today she fights to give her son a better future. Thanks to her efforts and desire to improve she sells quesillos door-to-door as a business. She spends 8 hours a day with a 20 kilogram hamper on her head offering her goods to her community.<br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda Eugenia is requesting a loan to invest in working capital to buy raw materials to make the quesillos like cheese, tortilla, onions, chilies, cabbage, bags, serviettes and cream. Mar\u00eda is grateful for the support that the lenders at Kiva offer to people of modest resources in poor countries like Nicaragua so they can enjoy dignified employment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1212816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock her business with raw materials like cheese, tortillas, onion, chile, cabbage, bags, serviettes and cream.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T17:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T17:40:14Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.6,"local_amount":782.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":831.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199781},{"amount":31.91,"local_amount":765.76,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":813.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449669191},{"amount":17.52,"local_amount":420.4,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":446.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955582},{"amount":91.88,"local_amount":2205.24,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2342.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176343},{"amount":66.82,"local_amount":1603.73,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1703.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298252},{"amount":11.96,"local_amount":286.98,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":304.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530064427},{"amount":36.1,"local_amount":866.35,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":920.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542557736},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":792.39,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:20:49Z","rounded_local_amount":841.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561690620},{"amount":53.19,"local_amount":1276.71,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1356.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579618599}],"funded_date":"2013-12-20T18:41:48Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:22:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":642218,"name":"Umu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Umu, a 48-year-old married mother of seven from Waterloo2, the western rural area in Freetown.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 48 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Philip has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nPhilip is a reliable member of the community.  He is married and has seven children.  Philip is 38 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 25 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Philip is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group and savings group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue with the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nPhilip first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Philip joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and earn enough to feed his family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  As an active community member, he wants to help more farmers.  Philip plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, save for the future, and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Philip\u2019s own life has improved because he has more profits from his harvest and has been able to save money and feed his family. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Philip and the Amani Group will use the Kiva loan to cover the initial cost of purchasing the seed and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting seasons to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3950,"image":{"id":1485188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete-","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":342336,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3950,"local_amount":342336,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":342741.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722806}],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T21:14:42Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":642783,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Marie est une dame \u00e2g\u00e9 de 37 ans mari\u00e9, m\u00e8re de 3 enfants dont l'\u00e2ge varie de 15 \u00e0 6 ans.

","en":"Mustafo is 27 years old. He lives in the town of Nurek with his wife and two children. Mustafo has a small business. Nine years ago, he started selling groceries. His shop is in a good location, which increases the number of customers. Mustafo sells products such as sausages, dairy products, canned foods, sweets, candy, chocolate, coffee, tea, sugar, soft drinks, baby food, etc. Mustafo is a very good salesman and businessman.

All the financial institutions rejected her loan request because of her unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Nona applied for a loan from MFO Credo. Her request was approved in the framework of the Start-Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  A loan of $1,600 will help Nona to purchase a secondhand car. Goderdzi will drive the car and they will transport fruits and vegetables to sell. This credit will be a great support for the family.

She says that the main business challenge is lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to buy more used clothing material to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and become successful. In the future, she plans to own a larger shop. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1485469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Julia has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right side of the photo with her hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 51 other individual farmers represented by this group.  The supplies provided consist of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 KES.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJulia is married and has eight children.  She is 48 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, and trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group. Julia has been a farmer for 10 years.  She described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2013 rainy season won\u2019t be Julia\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. She first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with them in order to obtain new farming methods, fertilizer, and hybrid seeds to earn enough to feed her family.  As an active member in her community, Julia also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader and being active in community activities.  Julia plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she was able to save money and feed her family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

He is 53 years old and is married with three children. He lives with his wife and children. Johnes has been able to learn better farming methods through his group but financial constraints limit him from implementing what he has learned.

is a 56-year-old married man. He lives with his wife and son in a small village of the Sachkhere district. His wife is a housekeeper and his son goes to the local school. Otari works on a minibus line and gets a small monthly income. \r\n\r\nOtari decided to start his own business and requested a loan.

He works alone every day from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm, depending on the amount of products that he must deliver since production is done manually.  In this way, he has managed to raise his son, who will soon be a lawyer.  Currently, he is requesting the help of this loan to invest in the purchase of wholesale supplies such as wood, scraps of cloth, wire, and other items.  His goal is to stock up and have the material available to make timely delivery of his pending orders.

Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 45 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of KES 5,349.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWycliffe is 38 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years.  He works as a farmer to provide for his seven children.  The community and other farmers know Wycliffe as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community activities such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Wycliffe described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\r\n\r\nWycliffe first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send hs children to school.  \r\n\r\nHe also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nWycliffe plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a cow and a goat, and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nWycliffe\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from his harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Wycliffe and the Alpha Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo, standing on the left.\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":1485230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase his harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wycliffe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyongesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prisila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwanamina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":315591,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315591}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3650,"local_amount":315591,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":316710.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722809}],"funded_date":"2014-02-04T16:06:14Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":642367,"name":"Naira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naira lives with her 9-year-old son in Yerevan.

She sells clothing for infants and children, a business she started 10 months ago after working as a saleswoman for another clothing business.  The experience she gained before gave her the confidence to open her own store.  She works alone from 11:00 in the morning until 8:00 in the evening.  The business generates enough income to pay family expenses and provide for her 9-year old son.  Flor is applying for a loan, part of which she will use to buy bulk supplies of merchandise--clothing for infants and children, accessories, diapers, wipes, etc.--and the rest to pay off an older loan.  She wants to expand her product range and meet the increased demand that she expects over the coming holidays.  Buying in bulk will increase her profit margin and help her to meet her biggest challenge, namely, competition from many similar businesses.  The investment will help Flor improve her business and expand her product range, goals that will, in turn, provide her with more income for supporting her and her family.

Joyce plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, and save for the future, and buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Joyce\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, and has more farm training, and was able to save money.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJoyce and the Matete Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPlease note that there are 3 additional group leaders in this photo that will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5425,"image":{"id":1485584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T00:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T00:00:10Z","loan_amount":5425,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roseland","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":470712,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470712}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5425,"local_amount":470712,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":470726.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722810}],"funded_date":"2014-01-14T23:11:22Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:35:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":642324,"name":"Galenur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Galenur is a 24-year-old married woman.

She is pictured here in a group of six One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 54 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Eunice has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nEunice is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years.  The community and other farmers know Eunice as friendly, and hardworking, and reliable, and trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community such as the women's group, and savings group, and prayer group.  Eunice described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEunice first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2008 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Eunice joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, and get new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Eunice plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to repair the home, and save for the future, and buy a cow, and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Eunice\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, and has more farm training, and was able to save money.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEunice and the Kosiana Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included

Elija has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 88 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nElija is married and has seven children.  He is 55 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, and prayer group .  Elija has been a farmer for 19 years.  Elija described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nElija first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Elija joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and fertilizer.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  Elija plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Elija\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and was able to feed his family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nElija and the Nehema Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

She finished high school in Bogot\u00e1.  Upon finishing school, Luisa longed to study something medical, because when she was in school she belonged to a Red Cross group and helped the nurses with their work caring for children who needed it.  She was excused from classes to help.  And so, in this way, a great desire to serve others through nursing came to live in Luisa\u2019s heart and she dreamed of helping the elderly and special needs children as a nurse.  Because of this she would like to be like a little white angel in a nursing uniform that represents love and service to others.\r\n\r\nLuisa has worked hard to not leave behind her dream of becoming a nurse and because of this she is doing everything possible, thanks to God, to work hard and save in order to be able to attend nursing school.  Now Luisa would like to be helped financially through Kiva because her pay from work isn\u2019t enough to cover the school fees and support two young children.\r\n\r\nShe is studying at Campo Alto and is asking for help because she doesn\u2019t have the money to pay for her fourth semester.  Please cooperate with her so that her fees aren\u2019t so high.  Thank you for helping her, she awaits your prompt response and, in this way, can continue with her studies and get her two children ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1505568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay registration for one semester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-06T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Esmeralda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392928},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069609},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882552},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":145684.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201916},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":291369.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286057}],"funded_date":"2014-01-06T02:03:55Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":642402,"name":"Mohamad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohamad is 21years old and single.

After finishing her bachelor\u2019s degree she wanted to start a new life and began studying health management.  She didn\u2019t like it because it did not involve mathematics.  Her life changed after two semesters and she learned that she would be receiving the best gift; she was pregnant.\r\n\r\nSince then her life and dreams changed forever.  She didn\u2019t think badly of her pregnancy, but instead believed that it would bring her lots of success in life.\r\n\r\nAfter her baby was born, her relationship with her family and friends changed.  Nothing is as before, but she knows that things happen for a reason and that this small baby girl would be the future of her success without making her life difficult for being a young mother.  She decided to move ahead with her life and began working, so she could provide everything for her daughter and not have to depend on anyone.\r\n\r\nAfter some time she decided to study high level hotel management.  Since then everything changed.  It\u2019s something she enjoys and where she is learning and understanding what she enjoys; mathematics.  She likes it and has a great desire to get ahead and she knows that this will not be the only thing she studies since she is only 22 years old and she knows that life will go on and that one must enjoy it.

He is pictured here in a group of nine One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 83 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  \r\n\r\nChristopher has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of KES 5,349 for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nChristopher is married and has seven children.  He is 69 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  \r\n\r\nChristopher has been a farmer for 39 years.  He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nChristopher joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and he is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Christopher joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family, and send his children to school.  He also became a group leader because he likes being a leader, is an active community member, wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nWorking with One Acre Fund has improved Christopher's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money, and was able to feed his family.  In the future, Christopher hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business.  \r\n\r\nChristopher and the Baraka Group Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

He is pictured here in a group of 9 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 103 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Hudson has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nHudson is married and has 9 children.  He is 54 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, and savings group, and prayer group, and burial committee. Hudson has been a farmer for 16 years. Hudson described his harvest as good last year, but he believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nHudson first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Hudson joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family, and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Hudson plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send the children to school, repair the home, save for the future, and buy a goat. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Hudson\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and support, and was able to save money and feed his family.  \r\n\r\nHudson and the Green Garden Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the

Andrew has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAndrew is 70 years old and has been a farmer for 40 years.  Andrew works as a farmer to provide for his 9 children. The community and other farmers know Andrew as friendly, hardworking and trustworthy. Other than farming, he is also involved in activities in his community such as the men's group.  Andrew described his harvest last year as excellent, but he hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAndrew first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Andrew joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods, earn enough to feed family, earn enough to feed the family and send the children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more One Acre Fund farmers. Andrew plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, buy a cow and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Andrew\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nAndrew and the Bulala Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":5250,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cyprian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priscila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":454665,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":454665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":642393,"name":"Christine's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine\u2019s group has 8 farmers and is located in Chwele District.

Because she wants to help more farmers, Christine has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Christine's life because she has more profits from the harvest and was able to feed her family.  In the future, Christine hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nChristine and the Namirembe Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4825,"image":{"id":1485363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":4825,"lender_count":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gentrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":417222,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417222}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4825,"local_amount":417222,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-19T10:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":418664.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722815}],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T16:27:09Z","paid_date":"2014-12-19T10:31:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":642396,"name":"Agnes' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is a member of the Bidii Group in Chwele District.

Leonard has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nLeonard is married and has 6 children.  He is 41 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Leonard has been a farmer for 25 years.  He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t.\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Leonard\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also wants to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  As an active member in his community, Leonard also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  He wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Leonard plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a goat and invest in a business.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvests and is able to save money.  He has more farm training and farm group support.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

Roderick has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 81 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nRoderick is married and has 18 children.  He is 74 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Roderick has been a farmer for 41 years.  Roderick described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Roderick\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also wants to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  As an active member in his community, Roderick also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, and he wants to help more farmers.  He wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Roderick plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair their home, save for the future, buy a goat and invest in a business.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvests and is able to save money.  He also has more farm training and group support through this program. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Roderick and the Action Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is 1 additional group leader in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5800,"image":{"id":1485633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":5800,"lender_count":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roderick","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":502806,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502806}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5800,"local_amount":502806,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-21T10:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":503265.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722819}],"funded_date":"2014-01-29T21:44:20Z","paid_date":"2014-12-21T10:31:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":642409,"name":"Onua-Do Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These five members are part of a group called 'onua-do' who all live in the same neighborhood and work together whenever the need arises.

She has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business eight years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nMirgul is a very responsible, punctual and ambitious woman who knows how to run her farming business and where to invest her money.  Thanks to her very hard work, she now owns four dairy cows and ten sheep.

For the past 1 1\/2 years, Janet has been working hard to manage her bakery business, which sells chapatti and donuts. \n\nTo help expand her business, Janet has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more baking flour and firewood for making chapatti and donuts to sell.  This will help Janet to generate greater profits, take care of herself, and grow her business. Janet hopes that in the future she will be able to get established in a bigger way. \n\nJanet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is married and has two children who are currently in school. For the past five years, Allen has been working hard to manage her boutique, which sells clothes and materials. \n\nTo help expand her business, Allen has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase her stock and buy more clothes, and will help Allen to generate greater profits and improve her income, which is used for family support and school fees. \n\nAllen hopes that in the future, she will be able to own a bigger boutique. \n\nAllen is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Allen who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1483255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of four children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. For the past many days, his rickshaw is not working properly, which has resulted in his inability to generate an income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to a lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Meera has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

","en":"Momokiz is a hardworking and conscientious woman who was born in 1965. She has been buying and selling dairy products for more than 10 years, purchasing milk from local residents, processing it and selling it in the central market. The past few months have been very difficult - her purse was stolen, with money in it, and to keep her business going she sold her own milking cow.

Zikrillo is 36. He is married with three children. His wife is a homemaker and takes care of household chores. Their three children are in school. Zikrillo has tried many things in his life and has a great deal of experience in retail and trade. At first he started working in animal husbandry - he bought cattle from one market and resold them with markup at another cattle market. After that he started selling potatoes and onions. He bought goods at wholesale prices from the growers and sold them with markup at a small market near his home. In such a way, he was able to save money, which he put toward the acquisition of a milk stall to sell dairy products. Zikrillo has made the decision to start a new business selling dairy products. He has about $600, but it is not enough to acquire the inventory he needs to begin. For this reason he is asking for a loan. He has already found a milk processor where he will buy his goods and he just needs help to start his business.

To make a living, he owns & operates a car accessories shop. He has been in this business for over 3 years. He started his business with limited capital. He gained access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to improve his business activities. He is very friendly and has already gained some permanent customers. He helps himself by bringing in new goods from the market where he buys supplies for his business. \r\n\r\nDue to the current unstable situation in Yemen, however, his business has had lower profits and fewer customers. So, he requested a loan of 150,000 YER from AMB to buy additional car accessories and supplies for his business. That should increase his sales, since this type of product is very popular. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.

Spring, Maryland since 2004.  The company\u2019s core business is to prepare corporate and individual tax returns.  The company\u2019s secondary services are to prepare small business\u2019 financial statements, assist with 8-a certification and help businesses with the incorporation process.  \r\n \r\nThe reason Geraldo is in need of financing is because of the seasonality of his business. As Geraldo explained, his peak season follows the tax season (January 15th \u2013 October 15th). The months of November and December are the slowest and it\u2019s during this time that Geraldo\u2019s company generates income from its secondary services, which are less profitable. Last fall, Geraldo went to the \u201cloan sharks\u201d for a 33 percent interest rate loan to help him get over this \u201chump.\u201d He vowed to not go down that path again this fall. He turned to LEDC to help him during this lull in business before the tax season ramps back up in January 2014.  \r\n \r\nGeraldo is originally from Queens, New York.  He is a trained engineer who spent many years building model trains before obtaining his MBA from the University of Maryland and entering into the accounting field in the mid-1990\u2019s.  He has two grown children who live in Missouri and North Carolina. In the future, Geraldo would like to expand his services to business clients, such as help his clients obtain small business loans, win contracts, and certify more minority firms at the state and federal level.

Asif has requested a loan of 200,000 PKR from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase new varieties of fabrics for his shop. He wishes to provide quality education for his children. He is very thankful to all the staff of Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.
