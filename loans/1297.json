She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Jocelyn also sells peanut butter for additional income.

Her income is helping  to pay for the family's everyday household expenditures as she and her husband work hard to provide for their everyday needs. \r\n\r\nKristine is now requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP to buy merchandise and products needed in her business such as electric fans, rice cookers, flat irons, bags, etc. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits will definitely help her to sustain her family's daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nKristine hopes to be more successful in business and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she finds strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1506287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Anna, Bishu and their three children (one son and two daughters) live in a kachha house (made of straw, mud and bamboo) in the small village of Raipara in Dhupguri in the district Jalpaiguri. Both Anna and her husband are uneducated and can only sign their names. All their children are receiving education and they are in grades 2,  5 and 6 respectively.\r\n\r\nAnna's husband is a farmer.  He grows seasonable vegetables in their own land and sells them in the local market.  He is the only source of income for the family.  Anna also helps her husband in his agricultural work, after managing her household work.  Their economic condition is not running smoothly because her household expenses are gradually increasing day by day, specially the educational expenses of her children.  Both Anna and her husband are struggling to cover their family's basic needs.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Anna and her husband have decided to start potato cultivation on their farmland.

Already paired with a boyfriend then and unable to go on studying, she decided to start a business instead of moving on in school.  Her partner makes a living selling snacks.  She has no children and lives with her mother and a sister.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoxana operates a food business, selling tostadas, fried yucca and enredos.  She works from her house and picked up the business from her mother who operated the business before.  She had always helped her mother so taking over the business made sense once she decided not to continue in school.  She has no other income and works this business from 2:00pm to 6:00pm, 4 days a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoxana wants to add more dishes--specifically, pupusas--to her menu and she will use this loan to buy a press and the other supplies she needs to improve her small kitchen.  The investment will help her to build up the business and, in turn, increase her income.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the future, Roxana would like to go back to school.

He is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 39 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Victor has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving funds for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nVictor is 62 years old and has been a farmer for 42 years.  Victor works as a farmer to provide for his 9 children.  The community and other farmers know Victor as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community activities such as the men's group and prayer group.  Victor described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nVictor joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Victor joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family.  Because he likes being a leader, and he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers. Victor has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Victor's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and has more farm group support.  In the future, Victor hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to repair the home, save for the future and invest in a business.\r\n\r\nVictor and the Amuka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1485595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T17:10:04Z","loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Humphreys","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bosco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":251403,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251403}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2900,"local_amount":251403,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-21T10:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":251632.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722820}],"funded_date":"2014-02-05T16:06:17Z","paid_date":"2014-12-21T10:31:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":654267,"name":"Maria Josefina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, es madre soltera, vive junto a sus hijos y una hermana, sus amistades la motivaron a adquirir una moto taxi, la cual paga quien la maneje, hoy en d\u00eda cuenta con  dos unidades, tambi\u00e9n tiene venta de repuestos para moto taxis, \nComprar\u00e1 diferentes repuestos y terminara de pagar una de las moto taxi, le permitir\u00e1 fortalecer el negocio de una forma r\u00e1pida y as\u00ed ofrecer\u00e1 un mejor servicio a sus clientes, espera mejorara su econom\u00eda para continuar dando a sus hijos una vida familiar m\u00e1s confortable.\nMar\u00eda sue\u00f1a con tener un negocio fortalecido y cancelar sus deudas.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda is a single mother who lives with her children and one sister.

The income of her husband is insufficient to cover household expenses, so she decided to give support to her husband financially. \r\n\r\nKrishna plans to take a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS, to purchase good quality potato seeds and fertilizers to farm potatoes along with other vegetables in her own farmland. She would like to extend her business and needs more laborers to assist her husband in farming. With the support of BJS and Kiva, Krishna is certain that she will be able to improve her business which will ultimately help her in earning more profit.\r\n\r\n If she is successful in earning a lot of profit from her potato cultivation, then Krishna wishes to build a concrete house rather living uncomfortably in a semi-pakka (concrete walls and thatched roof) house. Kalpana expressed great thanks to BJS and Kiva for their kind support which inspires her to start potato cultivation.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1506319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase good quality potato seeds and fertilizers for farming potatoes in her own farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-01-06T18:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T18:50:11Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Krishna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-06T21:57:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":654178,"name":"Serah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Serah is a 51-year-old married woman.

He has been running this business since 2003. He works at the business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, the start-up program, which enables people to start or re-start businesses.\r\n \r\nShe is requesting a loan to increase her business merchandise with more seasonal clothes that will fulfill customers' needs and requests.\r\nMaka hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand her business to a wider store that covers almost all of her customers' needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1506325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a stock of clothes and expand her activity.

45-year-old Yeabu from Jui Eastern in Freetown. She is married with three children. One of her children is currently attending school. \r\n\r\nDuring the past five years, Yeabu established her local food business. She began her business because she wants to create a permanent source of income to support her children. She works at the business for 10 hours per day and six days per week. She says that a major problem for her business is that it is sometimes very difficult to travel around the area to sell her goods.\r\n\r\nYeabu requires a loan in order to purchase groundnut, okra, and sweet potatoes for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, Yeabu plans to open a large food store. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1506433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He would like to purchase paints and materials for his ceramics to continue production.\r\n\r\nJose has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My favorite thing to do is to create new designs, and I love the challenge of crafting and painting them by hand. Each design is proof of the richness of our culture. Working with ceramics has brought me many beautiful things, from learning the craft from my mother and uncles, to providing for my family so that my four children can go to the university. I already have a grandchild, and my wish for all of them is that they become independent people with a career of their choice, and that they be responsible and be respectful of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll always be grateful for the help you are offering me. In 2014, I want to introduce new designs and, with this loan, I'll be able to buy the paints and brushes I need to continue creating works of ceramic art.

She is requesting a loan as there are various medicines that she doesn't have in her little business. She has been doing this for two years and her dream is to have a pharmacy in her community, as there are currently none. This would mean that people would not have to go in to town for syrups, serums, injections, and doctor-prescribed medicines. \r\n\r\nSeveral medicines have increased in price, and she does not currently have enough money. She needs more capital to buy the medicines that she doesn't have, and thus ensure that her clients continue to trust in her. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan that Ingrid has requested. She has had three previous loans and paid for them on time. She hopes that investors can help her once again.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1486656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy medicines to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":750.03,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":754.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439726817},{"amount":96.39,"local_amount":754.35,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":758.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449633018},{"amount":96.62,"local_amount":756.15,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":760.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459099660},{"amount":95.81,"local_amount":749.83,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":754.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467914691},{"amount":97.92,"local_amount":766.34,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":770.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479135432},{"amount":95.48,"local_amount":747.23,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":751.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490829257},{"amount":98.52,"local_amount":771,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":775.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504255098},{"amount":122.03,"local_amount":955,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":960.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517538621},{"amount":128.95,"local_amount":1009.15,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1015.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530021729},{"amount":192.97,"local_amount":1510.17,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1519.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542513661},{"amount":29.48,"local_amount":230.75,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":232.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561647137}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T17:05:35Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T12:02:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepti Limaye","image":1365774}},{"id":642708,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth is a 32-year-old married woman from Naivasha county.

She studied until 8th grade; she's married. Several years ago, they emigrated to the United States in search of a better life. There, she obtained work in a restaurant where she worked for 5 years. Later, they returned to their home country with some savings and established themselves as family, living in the city. Later, they decided to go live in a canton; they saw that they would have more opportunities to grow productively in this place, working at agriculture and animal husbandry. Along with them also lives a nephew that they raise like a son. Their two children depend on them economically.\r\n\r\nBersabe runs a store in the house, with which she provides products to the neighbors who stop by to obtain necessary products for the home. She has had the store for 4 years. Apart from this, she also works selling clothes in the seasons with most demand, like summer and Christmas. Her 13 year-old son also helps her sell when she is found busy with the domestic chores.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for this loan. In all of this time they have had to live in their house, they have not enjoyed having their own electricity. They obtain it from the house of her father who lives in front of them. The couple hopes that with the money from the loan, they will send to have two posts established that are needed to install the electricity in their house and, in this manner, not inconvenience her father.\r\n\r\nBersabe dreams of improving her house, so that it shines beautifully in the future.

Therefore, he approached Kaaba MFI and Kaaba will provide him with a laptop that he can pay for in installments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1486167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Islamic Finance","Arab Youth","Youth"],"use":"to buy a laptop for educational purposes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SO","country":"Somalia","town":"Hargeisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 48","type":"point"}},"partner_id":325,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasir Abdi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-02T09:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467945584},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-11T09:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479166648},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-03T09:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490861142},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T09:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504288649},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517571955},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530055277}],"funded_date":"2013-12-08T08:09:38Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T13:37:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":654411,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa is thankful for the financial assistance extended to her as she was able to buy more products for repacking.

Years of hard and tireless work gave Vahram the opportunity to become a specialized farmer. He produces a good harvest and sells it in the local market. High quality grapes which he gathers from his orchard are used in wine production and are highly demanded among local wine producers. \r\n\r\nVahram applied for the loan to be able to enlarge his farm. By requesting this loan of USD 1,000, Vahram would like to pay for renovation of the greenhouse and also purchase fuel for organizing the cultivation process of the sunflowers. He took a loan before from a local financial institution, but unfortunately he wasn't able to pay it back; however, thanks to his hard work during recent times, Vahram has been able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. Therefore, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. The loan will be a great support for this hardworking farmer, as he will be able to ensure better living conditions for his family.\r\n\r\nVahram lives with his wife and three children (his son is in

Abdukarim plans to raise sheep. Many rural residents in Tajkistan raise livestock and grow produce. Abdukarim also wants to follow this local tradition. He will buy sheep at the animal market in his region and will fatten them, keeping them in a stall. He already has two sheep. But this is not enough of a livestock to launch his business.

She now lives in a rented house along with her husband and her little ones, striving to advance. Cimi's work consists of making articles of clothing. She has a workshop in her home, and she has been doing this work for 17 years. Everything that she knows she learned by working since she was a young woman as an employee of a woman who worked in this occupation. Little by little and with much patience, she learned the techniques of dressmaking and decided to become independent to generate her own income, putting into practice everything that her employer taught her up to that time. Now she is part of a sewing workshop that she established with a partner. During the time that she has done this work, she has always searched for the best way to do her work, since many times the pressure of her customers has made her feel that she was not going to be able to complete her work efficiently. Nevertheless, she has coped with adversities, and now she has plans to expand her business, but she knows that the road to achieve this is long, and for the moment she wants to keep this as a long-term goal. Now she will prepare to begin to make her own designs and sell them, since she has orders from her customers. At this time she is applying for 1800 PEN. She is very happy to know that there are people who will offer her financial backing to continue developing her business. She also promises to be a punctual and responsible partner. With the amount she has applied for, she will stock her sewing workshop by buying fabrics, needles, threads, and other accessories that she needs in order to continue with her dressmaking work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1506653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy dressmaking materials such as fabrics, needles, threads, and other accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2014-01-07T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":269.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":286.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":297.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":299.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":319.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":328.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.16,"local_amount":269.06,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":272.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450598987},{"amount":103.43,"local_amount":286.42,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":290.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147854},{"amount":107.29,"local_amount":297.1,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":301.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468240952},{"amount":108.03,"local_amount":299.18,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-04T11:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":303.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258389},{"amount":115.32,"local_amount":319.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-01T11:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":323.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491502459},{"amount":118.77,"local_amount":328.91,"processed_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-25T12:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":333.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504306394}],"funded_date":"2014-01-07T20:42:08Z","paid_date":"2015-07-25T12:10:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":642808,"name":"Mehman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Mehman is 57 years of age and married.

The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nAndrew is a reliable member of the community, and  he is married with no children.  Andrew is 39 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 20 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Andrew is very active in his community and is involved in activities such as the men's group, prayer group and burial committee. Andrew is also involved in the community's public barazas.  \r\n\r\nHe described his harvest last year as excellent and hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoy the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\r\nAndrew first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Andrew joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed the family.  \r\n\r\nHe also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nAndrew plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to repair his home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Andrew\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Andrew and the Chepsitat Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T04:30:04Z","loan_amount":5075,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredric","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dismas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":438618,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":438618}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":642805,"name":"Linah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linah is 35 years old and supports four adults.

This is how she took charge of the boats, hiring people to work in fishing. Then her sons grew up, and they are the ones who now go to sea for more than 15 days to catch fish, which they turn over to the big fishing vessels on the high seas. Once they have caught enough fish, they return to the port together with the big fishing boat. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy nets, ropes, fuel, and food for the days that they have to be out at sea. She has been in the loan group since its beginning, and she likes it because of the unity that exists in the group.

In addition to this, Jacob is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group and savings group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJacob first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Jacob joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and an active community member.  Jacob plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to repair the home and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Jacob\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and more farm group support. \r\n\r\nJacob and the Imani WG Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to access hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":4325,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Electina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jentrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycliff","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":374430,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":642831,"name":"Hasmik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hasmik is 34 years old and she lives in Koghes village in Lori region.

Betty is 42 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 20 years to support her family.  In addition to this, Betty is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group.

As an active member in her community, Betty also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader and wants to help more farmers.  Betty plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school.

One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1485109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase their harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T07:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T07:10:14Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":224658,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224658}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2600,"local_amount":224658,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-21T10:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":225107.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722822}],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T21:22:31Z","paid_date":"2014-12-21T10:31:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":654262,"name":"Coumba's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le Banc villageois de Diatamine Saf\u00e9r\u00e9 est n\u00e9 le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2008 \u00e0 l'inauguration du Banc villageois.
