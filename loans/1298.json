She wants to use her Kiva loan to buy fertilizer to increase maize production.  With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. <br \/><br \/>The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

This is 43-year-old Miriam from Masvingo. She is married with three children, all attending school. She also cares for two other dependents. Miriam runs a manufacturing business producing peanut butter. The business has been in operation for five years.

Wabuke has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize seeds and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet seeds.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWabuke is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with four children.  Wabuke is 32 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 10 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Wabuke is very active in his community and is involved in the savings group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and also continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Wabuke\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2007 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  As an active member in his community, Wabuke also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Wabuke plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from his harvest.\r\n\r\nWabuke and the Hope Life Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wabuke","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":470712,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470712}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":642861,"name":"Gulnora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulnora was born in 1984.

She is however constrained financially and is hoping to receive a loan from Kiva that will enable her to purchase these farm inputs. \r\n\r\nTabitha believes that the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer will increase her yields, and she will not only get enough food for her family but will also sell the surplus and obtain money to pay school fees for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1486315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum, and millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sister","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nchagwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":24150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":24150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":24150,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25973.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468017191}],"funded_date":"2013-12-09T15:14:49Z","paid_date":"2014-05-07T09:25:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":654145,"name":"Ganjina","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u0439 25 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 1 \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0443 2 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0413\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0444\u0435 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e. \u0413\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446 \u0438 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435. \u0413\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0446\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433. \u0413\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 2500 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0435.

He believes that the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizers will increase his yields and he will not only get enough food for his family but will also sell the surplus and obtain money to pay for his children\u2019s school fees.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1486321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum and millet.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T16:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T16:10:09Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mathew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":24150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":24150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":16100,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":17315.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468017192},{"amount":7.45,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-26T09:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":645.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240572},{"amount":92.55,"local_amount":7450,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-04T09:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":8012.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530133648}],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T18:52:47Z","paid_date":"2014-10-04T09:55:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":642883,"name":"Janepher's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janepher is a member of Epeneza Group in Chwele District.

Janepher has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJanepher is 47 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years. She works hard to provide for her two children. Her community and other farmers know Janepher as friendly. Other than farming, she is also involved in community activities such as the women's and prayer groups. Janepher described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Janepher\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  She joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with them to get new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and to earn enough to feed her family. As an active member in her community, Janepher also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she wants to help more farmers. Janepher also became a One Acre Fund group leader because she was elected and this shows that farmers in her group have confidence in her. \r\n \r\nJanepher and the Epeneza Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJanepher plans on using future profits from her harvest to repair her home and buy a cow.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from her harvest and is able to save money and feed her family.

She is pictured here in a group of 4 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 45 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Adala has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAdala is married and has 2 children.  She is 50 years old and is known as a friendly and hardworking farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group.  Adala has been a farmer for 35 years.  She described her harvest as poor last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAdala first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  She joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and get new farming methods to enable her to earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader and wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Adala plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Adala\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAdala and the Eagles Farmers Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1485597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wanyama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mambo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":240705,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240705}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2800,"local_amount":240705,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":242423.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722829}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T18:44:34Z","paid_date":"2014-12-22T10:42:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":642903,"name":"Shehnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shehnaz is a married woman.

Since the death of her husband, she has brought in a small income. She had to work to provide for the needs of her two children.   \r\n\r\nFrom a friend she learned about Amway and began selling Amway products (linens, kitchen appliances, cosmetics and detergent). Her neighbors, relatives and friends became her customers. Since she knew a lot of people, making sales wasn\u2019t a problem. Later, she sold products from other companies the same way. \r\n\r\nWith her loan from Maya, she will order products to sell to her clients. When she applied for the loan, she already had customers waiting to order.  Because she sells from catalogs, she took orders from customers without the products on hand and ordered them wholesale. When she has the money in advance, she can order the products from the company at a discount. This way her profits are greater.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue doing this work as long as she is in good health. When she meets friends and neighbors, she can show them the products in the catalogs easily. She has the items they order shipped to her home and then delivers them to her clients. This type of work has advantages for \u00dclker, who also has time to spend on her home and children. \r\n\r\nBecause \u00dclker wasn\u2019t able to study, she wants her children to stay in school and she wants to give them a better life. Her son is currently enrolled in college and his goal is to study four more years. She wants her daughter to qualify for university, study and have a profession.  \r\n\r\n\u00dclker is a determined woman and skillful at working and selling.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff\r\n\u00dclker Han\u0131m,dul ve 2 \u00e7ocu\u011fu var.

Caro has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nCaro is 38 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years. Caro works as a farmer to provide for her five children. The community and other farmers know Caro as reliable and hardworking. Other than farming, she is also involved in community activities such as the women's group and the prayer group.  Caro described her harvest last year as excellent, but she hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nCaro first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Caro joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods and fertilizer and hybrid seeds. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader and wants to help more farmers. \r\n\r\nCaro plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Caro\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm group support and is able to feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nCaro and the Inuka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":1485320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":208611,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208611}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2425,"local_amount":208611,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":209956.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722827}],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T06:05:23Z","paid_date":"2014-12-22T10:42:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":642915,"name":"James' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Namatunzo is a group of four farmers in the Matete district with James selected as the Kiva representative.

At the beginning, he did not know what to study, he researched courses but could not decide, until an auto repair course called his attention.  So far, he is happy studying for this career because he wants to know about the automobile world, how they work, their secrets and how to drive them.  Anderson leads a fairly organized life.  He goes to work in a small general store at 6 in the morning in order to pay for his studies.  He works for 6 hours, and then finishes his day by going to his automotive mechanics classes. \r\n\r\nIn addition to working to pay for his education, his mother and father help and support him but giving him 35% of the monthly fees as his work in the store does not provide him with enough income.

She is pictured here in a group of four with One Acre Fund group leader.  The group  represent a total of 42 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Macraline has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMacraline is married and has eight children.  She is 50 years old and is known as friendly and hardworking.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group.  Macraline has been a farmer for 30 years.  She described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nMacraline is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Macraline joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and earn enough to feed her family.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member and wants to help more farmers.  Macraline plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Macraline\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from her harvest and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMacraline and the Amuka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included

When she first started out, she sold children\u2019s clothing around her neighborhood.  Eventually, going where her friends invited her she earned a better income.  Later she went to sell at markets and borrowed money to buy a car with her uncle\u2019s support.  With the car she was able to go to the city market all year round.  For 10 years, she sold her products both in her neighborhood and at the city market to improve her economic situations.  With the money she earned, she paid off the car loan.  She sold the car and bought a bigger one with the money and some of her earnings from the market.  She increased the variety of her products.  She continued like this for 10 years.\r\n\r\nAfter 10 years Saniye decide to open a store.  Through the force of her determination, the support of her friends and family, and her economic position, she opened a children\u2019s clothing and novelty shop.  For four months she kept going to sell at city markets.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n

After she and her husband separated, she had to support herself and her son. With the help of her father, she opened a small artificial flower shop at a local mall. At first she sold bridal arrangements and flowers for the home at the shop. Then she slowly began to develop her business. She began to prepare traditional wedding candy, flowers and vow trays (trays that hold the rings and other small items at Turkish weddings). At first she sold retail at her shop. Then she opened a small workshop and began to design vow trays wholesale for the shopkeepers in the city. Now Sevgi has two retail stores and a workshop. With the loan from Maya, she wants to have flower products delivered to her workshop to sell at her shop. She aims to increase her customers and her profits this way. Her goals are to develop her workshop into a factory, do a lot of business and prepare a good future for her son.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n\r\n1 \u00e7ocuk annesi olan sevgi daha \u00f6nce evliyken de evde yapma \u00e7i\u00e7ek hobi olarak yap\u0131yordu.

Alfred became a One Acre Fund group leader because he was elected by other members in his group. He is pictured here in a group of 9 One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 87 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Alfred has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. Alfred is also involved in the community's Faulu Kenya.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nHe and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAlfred is 70 years old and has been a farmer for 40 years. Alfred works as a farmer to provide for his 22 children. The community and other farmers know Alfred  as reliable and trustworthy. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community's activities such as the prayer group. Alfred described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Alfred \u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family. As an active member in his community, Alfred also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers. Alfred plans on using future profits from the harvest to repair his home and buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from the harvest and is able to feed his family.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Alfred and the Exodus Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

For more than 5 years she has worked alongside her husband growing basic grains like corn and beans, and vegetables. Her parents are the ones who taught her how to work the land at a very young age because it is her family's vocation. She has an incomplete primary education. She completed up to the third year in school until her parents could no longer support her economically. She has four children, but only two (who are older) support their parents in their work in the fields because the remaining two are very young and they study at the community school. Her customers are her neighbors, family and intermediaries who arrive in this area to acquire products that they consider to be of high quality, hygienic and at a good price for resale. A challenges she faces, along with the majority of farmers with scarce resources, is the high prices of the supplies that they use to support their crops and the hauling of these same items to the area where their homes are. Consequently, today she is seeking financing to purchase supplies that will help protect her crops from bugs like the whitefly and the water worms that destroy and gnaw on the grains. \r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to repair certain areas of her home, like the kitchen where she prepares their sacred food, which has deteriorated. As the mother of a family she desires that her children will be prepared academically and become professionals with better opportunities and that she can improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1487358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase agricultural supplies to support her\r\ncrops of vegetables and basic grains.

After her husband retired, and Fatma was still a housewife, they opened a shop selling artificial flowers in the Esnaf Saray\u0131 shopping mall.  In their shop, they make home decorations and bridal flowers. Fatma and her husband have put a lot of effort into their business.  A compatriot of theirs, who works in Belgium, bought some bridal flowers from their shop.  After that, she began coming back to Turkey every two months and buying more flowers to resell in Belgium. The flowers made by Fatma and her husband began to make their way to Belgian brides.  \r\n\r\nFor the menswear brand Sarar, they began making thousands of boutonnieres for men\u2019s suits. With the loan from Maya, Fatma intends to buy more artificial flowers with which she will create different arrangements so that she can increase her orders and sales.  Both of Fatma\u2019s sons have attended university. While at first Fatma and her husband had rented their shop, they have since been able to buy the property. With their future earnings, they hope to pave the way for a good life and future for their children.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n\r\n2 \u00e7ocu\u011fu olan Fatma, e\u015fi emekli olduktan sonra kendisi ev han\u0131m\u0131yken e\u015fiyle beraber esnaf saray\u0131nda yapma \u00e7i\u00e7ek d\u00fckkan\u0131 a\u00e7m\u0131\u015flar.

Nazeeh has been trying his best to cover his family's needs and to provide his son with the best education by running his project of selling clothes in his own store for the past 3 years.

Verido, along with his wife Hilaria, raised his nine children. Most of his children are living out and have their own family. Hilaria spends most of her time on the farm.\r\n\r\nVerido got inspired planting cacao from his fellow farmers. He was motivated by the outcome of the cash in hand when Maya Mountain Cacao Staff purchase freshly harvested cacao from the farm to the scale. Verido also cultivates different types of cash crops. He presently lives on his farm with his wife and two daughters.\r\n\r\nVerido is requesting this loan to hire workers to properly clean his farm.

His wife, Juana, spends most of her time attending to the children.<br \/><br \/>Santiago was inspired to plant cacao by the advisory of Agriculture from Guatemala, and his fellow farmers' advice. He manages his 1500 cacao trees up-to-date. Santiago holds outside employment, as well, which gives him limited time to properly clean his farm. Rain has been a challenge, he stated; the weeds grow too fast for him to control. His favorite of all is picking ripe pods and selling the product. Santiago also cultivates different types of crops for home consumption.<br \/><br \/>Santiago is requesting this loan to hire workers to clean his cacao trees. With this loan he would be able to have his cacao farm clean and continue his other employment, and his family will be happy at home.<br \/><br \/>Santiago's future goal is to expand with more cacao trees. He also wants to support his children financially, to get some level of education and find professional jobs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1503947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to clean and properly maintain his 1500 organic cacao trees, while continuing his other employment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Red Bank","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2014-01-07T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T18:30:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467959992},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":167.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180773},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875369},{"amount":85.41,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":167.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302578},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585359},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":167.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530080941},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542561827},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":167.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694527},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":500.01,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":503.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612001118},{"amount":85.4,"local_amount":166.63,"processed_date":"2015-04-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-08T11:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":167.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636514230}],"funded_date":"2014-01-07T21:11:57Z","paid_date":"2015-05-08T11:01:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":652990,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa, age 50, is a female organic cacao farmer, who lives in the beautiful village of Laguna.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Aida is engaged in the cultivation of greens and grapes. Her daughter and son help her sell the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of the family's income.\r\n\r\nTo continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Aida needs a loan of 2,000 USD to purchase necessary materials for greenhouse construction (cellophane, bottles), and to buy fertilizers. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Aida was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments.\r\n\r\nSo, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Aida and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their

She wants them to have a good education and to study without complications and become fine, upstanding men. Her mother is the person who supports them and it is very difficult for her to provide a good education, as well.\r\n\r\nDayhanna wants to have a good future and to become a professional with a good job. Then she can help to support her brothers in their studies and she and her mother can get ahead together and avoid the problems that have plagued them in the past.

He is pictured here in a group of 4 One Acre Fund farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 40 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Phillison has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nPhillison is married and has 5 children.  He is 46 years old and is known as a friendly and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and burial committee.  Phillison has been a farmer for 20 years.  Phillison described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nPhillison first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Phillison joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and earn enough to feed family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, wants to help more farmers and also spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Phillison plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Phillison\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest and was able to feed the family.\r\n\r\nPhillison and the Inama Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

He enjoys dairy farming and milking the cows.\r\n\r\nLawrence chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer very good services, and provide loans at a low interest rate.  He also learned that in order to have economic growth, one must also develop a lifestyle of saving.  This loan will enable Lawrence to irrigate his crops because he will have a water tank to store enough water.  This will help his crops produce more and will increase his income base.

He is pictured here in a group of nine One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 71 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Felix has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nFelix is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with five children.  Felix is 45 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last five years to support his family.  In addition to this, Felix is involved in the prayer group.  He described his harvest last year as one not with One Acre Fund.  He hopes that as a One Acre Fund farmer he is able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers that have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFelix is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rain season. Felix joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative.  Felix plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Felix\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training.  \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFelix and the Bidii farmers Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vitalis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Conrad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":379779,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Kuperberg","image":null}},{"id":642959,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida is an experienced farmer from Tandzut village of Armavir region.

Instead of working, she has always stayed at home looking after the children. She attended school up to class X (Grade 10). Her husband received education up to class VIII (Grade 8). One of their children, the son, reads in class I ( Grade 1). They have a kachha house (a house made of bamboo, mud and straw).\r\n\r\nPurnima's husband works on their own land where he grows seasonal vegetables. The products are sold at the local market. In this way, he earns a livelihood for their family. Despite his hard work, his earnings don't stretch far enough to live. So Purnima has decided to stretch out her helping hands to her husband. She thought of starting potato cultivation on their land. She applied for loan from Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS) to purchase potato seeds, fertilizers, manure, etc., for cultivating potatoes. As potatoes are in great demand in their local market and in the present time, their hope is that this business will be a lucrative one and will increase their earnings and generate the money they need to support their family.\r\n\r\nPurnima's dream is to make a pakka house (concrete-made) with the profit generated.

Haruni plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Haruni\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to feed the family. \r\n\r\nHaruni and the Baraka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

She is a widow who takes care of four children. They all go to school. She would like to use a Kiva loan to buy fertilizer during maize production.  She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase her production. \r\n\r\nWith profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Because she is an active community member and wants to help more farmers, Agness has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved her life because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, and was able to save money.  In the future, Agness hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Agness and the Mamboleo Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left side of the photo.\t\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1486071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase their harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agness","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clare","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":326289,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326289}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3775,"local_amount":326289,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":326839.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722832}],"funded_date":"2014-01-28T21:39:16Z","paid_date":"2014-12-22T10:42:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Devon Reed","image":1341228}},{"id":643554,"name":"Mar\u00eda De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda ha trabajado durante los \u00faltimos 20 a\u00f1os en su propio negocio, un peque\u00f1o quiosco donde ofrece desayunos, almuerzos, alimentos fritos, mecato, gaseosas, entre otros, se encuentra ubicada al lado de un parqueadero de buses, por lo que sus principales clientes son los conductores de la zona, trabaja sola todos los d\u00edas desde muy temprano en las ma\u00f1anas, as\u00ed genera los recursos necesarios para solventar los gastos de su familia, conformada por su esposo y 3 hijos, a los que ha sacado adelante con mucho esfuerzo.

David has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving the necessary inputs to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid is 34 years old and has been a farmer for 15 years. David works as a farmer to provide for his three children. The community and other farmers know David as friendly, hardworking and reliable. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the men's group and the savings group.

David joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get fertilizer, hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and is an active community member and wants to help more farmers. David plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nDavid and the Amuka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet and sorghum seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":5075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":438618,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":438618}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":642970,"name":"Rejia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rejia is a married woman.

In order to help support her spouse and meet the needs of her children, she started sewing at home. She did not have a hard time finding customers and soon opened a shop with a partner. However, she and her partner separated, and she opened her own shop. With a loan from Maya Fatma bought a sewing machine and for seven years ran the shop and did all of the sewing on her own. \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to her sewing Fatma sells Amway products. Because most of the Amway sales are order-based, cash is tight so she would like to get a loan. If she had the Amway products in bulk, she would be able to make more of a profit and be able to give her customers their goods when they come into the store instead of having to wait for delivery.\r\n<p>\r\nFatma is now applying for a 1,000 TRY loan through Maya to buy more Amway stock and sewing materials. Two of her children are getting married, and the youngest would like to finish university. Once these obligations with the children are over, Fatma would like to go on a pilgrimage.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nFatma Han\u0131m,evli ve 3 \u00e7ocu\u011fu var.  \u0130lk ba\u015flarda e\u015fine destek olmak,\u00e7ocuklar\u0131n\u0131n ihtiya\u00e7lar\u0131n\u0131 kar\u015f\u0131lamak i\u00e7in evde diki\u015f dikmeye ba\u015flam\u0131\u015f.

One of their children is of school-going age and reads in class I (grade 1).\r\n\r\nSahena\u2019s husband owns a plot of ancestral land where he grows different vegetables in different seasons. They sell them in the local market. Now they decided to cultivate potatoes on their land. She has taken a loan from BJS to buy potato seeds and fertilizers, and start potato cultivation, which is a very profitable business in that area.\r\n\r\nShe hopes the business will generate more profits, by which she will be able to meet the family's needs, give better education to her children and make some savings to build a pacca house (concrete-made) in the future.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful

Sobita has an education up to class VIII (grade 8). She was not able to continue her studies due to the lack of financial resources of her parents. Her husband, Biswanath, aged 28 years, is illiterate and can only sign his name. One of the children receives education and reads in class II (grade 2). The second son is under school-going age. They have a kachha house (bamboo, mud and straw-made) in Alta village in the district of Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nSobita's husband is engaged in agricultural work. The land he works is their own, inherited from his parents. There he grows different kinds of seasonal vegetables. He carries them to the local market and sells them. In this way, he earns and meets the family's needs. But his small income is not sufficient to maintain a family of four, when the prices of essential commodities are increasing by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nSo, they thought to start potato cultivation on their land. Sobita heard that Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS, gives loans to the rural women to start new businesses. So, she applied for a loan to purchase good-quality potato seeds and fertilizers to start a potato cultivation business. This product is in great demand in the present market. So, Sobita\u2019s wish is to get a huge profit from the business.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to expand her business to generate more profits, with which she will be able to help her husband with the family expenses, such as educational expenses of her children, health and food, and to invest the rest in her business.\r\n\r\nHer future dream is to build a pacca house (concrete-made).\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1486460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase potato seeds and fertilizers for cultivating potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T21:10:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T21:10:23Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sobita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-09T15:26:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":643037,"name":"Celine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celine is married and a mother of five children.

He is pictured here in a group of eight One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nThe group leaders represent a total of 87 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Alex has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nAlex is married and has one child.  He is 28 years old and is known as friendly, hard-working, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and prayer group.  \r\n\r\nAlex has been a farmer for six years.  He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAlex first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Alex joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, fertilizers, and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nAlex plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Alex\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, was able to save money, and feed his family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nAlex and the Korokoro M SHG Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.

All the three daughters are receiving education.\r\n \r\nFulada's husband's income is not enough to meet their household expenses and their children's educational expenses. So Fulada has decided to start tea cultivation in their plot of land.  The idea came to her as an alternative way to generate more income. She applied for a loan from BJS to buy tea seedlings and fertilizers to start cultivation of tea plants, and start a business of selling tea leaves in their locality.  Tea leaves are in good demand in the present market.\r\n\r\nWith perseverance, love and great dedication Fulada hopes she will be able to achieve her objectives and earn enough money to help her husband with the family's finances. Fulada's dream is to continue earning money with this business. In this way she will be able to continue to support her children.

Wekesa has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWekesa is married and has ten children.  He is 60-years-old and is known as friendly, hardworking and trustworthy.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Wekesa has been a farmer for twenty years.  He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWekesa first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Wekesa joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, and he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Wekesa plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home and save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Wekesa\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from the harvest, able to save money and feed the family. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWekesa and the Best Home Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete-","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T22:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T22:10:07Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wekesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jumba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kivajiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":283497,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283497}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":643058,"name":"Hala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hala is a 50-year-old Lebanese woman.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 32 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Protus is pictured on the right of the Lutaso Group with his hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nProtus is 39 years old and has been a farmer for 24 years. Protus works as a farmer to provide for his 6 children. The community and other farmers know Protus as hardworking. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community's activities, such as the men's group and savings group. Protus described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of the One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nProtus first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Protus joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers. Protus plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Protus\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and has more farm group support.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nProtus and the Lutaso Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1485425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janerose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":171168,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171168}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2000,"local_amount":171168,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-27T10:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":173159.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722840}],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T15:58:25Z","paid_date":"2014-12-27T10:32:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Francine Abes","image":454244}},{"id":643075,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema is married with two children and one child goes to school.

joven Nelson, pues bien, ingresaron al sal\u00f3n de clases donde hab\u00edan ni\u00f1os, ni\u00f1as y j\u00f3venes con diversas personalidades, y como en todo sal\u00f3n no faltan los grupos de juiciosos, lo recohceros pero inteligentes, los callados y los que le quer\u00edan ver el lado positivo y humor\u00edstico de cualquier comentario, aquellos j\u00f3venes que hab\u00edan ingresado al sal\u00f3n se presentaron como estudiantes de campo alto, describi\u00e9ndola como una instituci\u00f3n con programas t\u00e9cnicos, que preparaban a la gente con la educaci\u00f3n para el trabajo, les describen los diferentes programas, alguno de estos j\u00f3venes del colegio al que pertenec\u00eda Nelson , les pareci\u00f3 imposible, y otros ni prestaron atenci\u00f3n, pero fueron muy pocos a los que les intereso, a Nelson le pareci\u00f3 algo complicado pero no imposible, por ello se intereso al recibir la informaci\u00f3n en un volante y llenar una planilla donde se anoto y dejo algunos datos , Nelson al finalizar la jornada acad\u00e9mica de su colegio parti\u00f3 para su casa, y al llegar a ella le comento a la mama lo que hab\u00eda sucedido acerca se la informaci\u00f3n que le hab\u00edan brindado los estudiantes de campo alto, a la mama le gusto esto, al joven le estaba pareciendo la idea en su mente, dej\u00e1ndolo bastante pensativo y a la vez animado ya que lo ve\u00eda como una verdadera oportunidad para salir adelante, un poco pensativo con la parte financiera, aunque le hab\u00edan dicho que le daban un subsidio , esto paso m\u00e1s o menos en el mes de septiembre, en el mes de diciembre llamaron al celular el cual hab\u00eda dejado anotado en la planilla, en ese momento estaba indeciso ya que la llamada era para invitarlo a matricularse en cualquier programa t\u00e9cnico laboral, la mama de Nelson lo \u00e1nimo para que iniciara un programa de estos, por ello al verse respaldado por la familia decide  tomar la decisi\u00f3n de ir a campo alto en la sed de suba, para \u00e9l esta instituci\u00f3n no era tan desconocida como tal, ya que la hermana estudiaba en ella tambi\u00e9n, el en la actualidad se encuentra estudiando auxiliar contable, donde se encuentra muy animado por haber tomado esta decisi\u00f3n, no se ha arrepentido de pertenecer a esta instituci\u00f3n, le apasiona los n\u00fameros y se siente identificado al momento de hacer un ejercicio, un taller, ver una teor\u00eda, a experimentado otro mundo acad\u00e9mico con tan corta edad , le parece que este t\u00e9cnico le sirve como una base para ingresar m\u00e1s adelante en una universidad, ya que quer\u00eda seguir con la contabilidad pero ya profesional, para salir adelante, ser alguien y ayudarle a la familia, darle respaldo econ\u00f3micamente y en todo sentido a si como ellos lo han hecho con el, por ello el quiere seguir con las practicas, y requiere del subsidio de kiva como una ayuda, ya que en el momento no posee recursos suficientes para culminar su t\u00e9cnico laboral.\n\nGracias \n","en":"The young Nelson was in the ninth grade studying at school one day when at the end of the day two youths in uniform who appeared to be students or nurses arrived at his classroom. Evidently they were not students of the institution where young Nelson studied, however, they entered the classroom. The classroom was filled with boys, girls and young people with different personalities. As in all classrooms, there was no lack of groups of the sensible, the joking but intelligent, the quiet and those that wish to see the positive and humorous of every comment. \r\n\r\nThe youths that had entered the room introduced themselves as students of Campo Alto, which they described as an institution with technical programs that prepared people with the education they needed for work. They described the different programs and to some of the students of Nelson\u2019s school it seemed impossible, others did not even pay attention but there were few who were interested by it. To Nelson it seemed like something complicated but not impossible. He was interested in receiving information through a flyer and filled out a sheet where he wrote down and left some contact information. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing school that day, Nelson headed home and upon arriving to his house he told his mom about the information that the students of Campo Alto had shared with him. His mom liked the information and Nelson started to think it over in his head. He thought very positively about the idea and at the same time was excited as he already saw it as a true opportunity to get ahead. He was a little hesitant about the financial part, even though they had told him that they would give him a subsidy.\r\n\r\nThis all happened more or less in September. In December, Campo Alto called the cell phone that he had listed on the informational sheet. In this moment, Nelson was indecisive as the call was to invite him to enroll in any of the technical work programs. Nelson\u2019s mother encouraged him to start in one of these programs and due to the backing of his family he decided to go to Campo Alto with the drive to improve. For him, this institution was not too unknown as his sister studied there as well.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nelson is studying to be an accounting assistant. He is very happy that he made this decision and has not regretted joining the institution. He is passionate about numbers and he identifies with the exercises, the workshops and seeing a theory. He enjoys experimenting with a whole other world of academics at such a young age. Nelson believes this technical skill will serve him as a base to later enter a university. \r\n\r\nNelson already wants to continue with accounting but as a professional so that he can get ahead, be somebody and help his family, providing economic and all other types of support as they have done for him.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 46 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package of crop inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Willson is pictured on the right of the Jua Kali Group with his hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWillson is married and has 13 children.  He is 73 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Willson has been a farmer for 63 years.  He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWillson first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2008 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Willson joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices,  get new farming methods, get fertilizer, hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nWillson plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair their home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Willson\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from his harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, is able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWillson and the Jua Kali Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Willson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felistus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":246054,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246054}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":643084,"name":"Hadjah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadjah is married with five children, all of whom go to school.
