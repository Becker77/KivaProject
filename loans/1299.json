Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She has three children, but her husband is left long ago and she has to raise her children alone. She was born and lives to this day in a small village. Jumagul works as a nurse at a local hospital. There she has one good nurses' pay, but it is not enough to raise her family, as she is a single mother. Here's a woman and mother who decided to supplement her income and she chose to open a food trading store. She did not have enough funding for this. Not having the right amount of funds, she asked our organization and said, that after she began to work together with our organization her life changed for the better.

Jumagul expresses her gratitude for MDO Arvand for financial support and the opportunity and

Shodigul. She is 35 years old and lives with her family in the Shahritus district. Shodigul has a large family, and to support it she wants to invest her savings into beginning a family business. She plans to practice animal husbandry. The whole family will help her. She decided to raise cattle on her property, using a small barn. She has had a few cattle for many years, for family use. She knows a lot about raising livestock, and decided that she could use her experience and skills in business. However, she doesn't have the funds to buy a couple of cows and bulls to begin the business. She is asking for a loan. The amount she needs isn't large although buying and selling livestock requires a lot of money.

Having joined the group recently, he learned from the older group members that he could get an alternative source of fuel for his wife that was cleaner, cheaper and more convenient. He learned that his family could enjoy solar power for lighting and avoid buying kerosene. The economical cook stoves for firewood and charcoal would also enable her wife save 50% of the fuel consumption.

She also has a direct-selling business and sells frozen foods for additional income.\n\nShe would like to apply for another 14,000 PHP loan for her to buy more materials needed in furniture making, like bamboo, nails, varnish and other materials, products for her retail business such as soaps and processed foods. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children's education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\n\nCarole Cristina dreams to be more successful in her business and hopes to have a happy family. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The group represent a total of 53 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Brenda is pictured on the right of the Ebeneza Group with her hand raised.\t\r\n\r\nBrenda is 37 years old and has been a farmer for seventeen years. Brenda works as a farmer to provide for her four children. The community and other farmers know Brenda as hardworking and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community, such as the women's group and burial committee. Brenda described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nBrenda first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Brenda joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nBrenda plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Brenda\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training, has more farm group support and was able to feed the family.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBrenda and the Ebeneza Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. \r\n\r\nThroughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

He is married and has three children. They are a very close family, living in a rural area. In order to earn money for the family, everyone tries to do what they can to earn an income. Bek himself is a truck driver, and he has his own truck for this work. The job doesn't earn him a great income, but he also earns money from his own business. For several years Bek has been raising livestock. It is his principal and most stable business. He raises and sells animals, and his wife helps with the work by caring for the livestock, and also selling milk from the animals. Bek's two sons are working in construction in Russia, and they send money home. But since raising livestock earns a good and stable income, Bek wants to expand the business. He needs to buy a few more head to raise and later sell. To do this Bek contacted Arvand, and would like a loan to purchase animals. He hopes that the business will develop successfully and bring big profits to improve his family's standard of living. Bek thanks Arvand for its support in advance.

Her woven collections consist of bed covers, pillow covers, mosquito nets, blanket covers, wrap-around skirts and women's shawls.\r\n\r\nWith this Kiva loan, Premila is planning to hire more weavers and purchase more yarn and thread for weaving purposes. She is also interested in getting a new loom for the hired weavers to use. She will grant them their wages and supply them with the required materials, as she will be able to meet the demands the retailer has asked for. She will continue her business and aspires to become one of the largest producers of woven clothes and tailored clothes in the area.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in embroidery works and weaving.

He lives with his parents. George works as a builder locally on special projects, but his earnings are unstable from that activity and are not enough to cover utilities and food costs. For this reason, George has decided to diversify the business and start up a small caf\u00e9, where various pies and fast food products will be sold.  \r\n\r\nAccording to George\u2019s estimation, sales will be high, as the location where he plans to start his cafe is crowded with people.

He has bred livestock from a very young age thanks to his father who taught him well. He already has 10 years of experience. During these years, Sanani has acquired the knowledge and skills required for the business. He purchases calves in the central livestock market and raises them. After fattening the animals, he resells them for a profitable price in a livestock bazaar. Meat is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like pilau and dolma.\r\n\r\nHis business requires a lot of physical strength, as Sanani spends most of his time in the open air.

Nanyanga has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 50 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nNanyanga is 43 years old and has been a farmer for 20years.  Nanyanga works as a farmer to provide for her 7 children.  The community and other farmers know Nanyanga as friendly, hardworking, reliable and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community activities such as the women's group, prayer group and the burial committee.  Nanyanga described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nNanyanga first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Nanyanga joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and as an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Nanyanga plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Nanyanga\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and is able to save money and feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nNanyanga and the Bakholera Alala Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1485591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nanyanga","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosamu ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taabumary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":267450,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3100,"local_amount":267450,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-27T10:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":268456.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722841}],"funded_date":"2014-02-06T19:43:45Z","paid_date":"2014-12-27T10:32:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maadhavi Ramanayake","image":null}},{"id":654781,"name":"Blanca Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Blanca de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con sus dos  02 hijos que dependen de ella en una comunidad de San Lorenzo, al sur de Honduras, tiene casa propia  y se dedica desde hace muchos a\u00f1os  a la venta de abarroter\u00eda como ser: caf\u00e9, huevos, granos b\u00e1sicos, carnes, frescos, ropa, etc.\nDo\u00f1a Blanca  es una mujer bien trabajadora con muchos deseos de sacar adelante a su familia, est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para de az\u00facar, caf\u00e9, pan, manteca, arroz, frijoles, agua, leche, etc. y tener m\u00e1s productos para su negocio ya que desea surtirlo porque la demanda es bastante fuerte para esta \u00e9poca.

Joseph has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 70 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nJoseph is 45 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years.  Joseph works as a farmer to provide for his 10 children.  The community and other farmers know Joseph as hardworking and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the men's group and savings group.  Joseph described his harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJoseph first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Joseph joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers.  Joseph plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, and repair the home, and buy a cow, and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJoseph and the Lukhuna Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":4325,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jafether ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukhwana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luke","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wanyama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makokha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":374430,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maadhavi Ramanayake","image":null}},{"id":654659,"name":"Issa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"ISSA  est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 49 ans et vit avec ses cinq enfants et ses \u00e9poux dans la sous pr\u00e9fecture de OUELESSEBOUGOU, R\u00e9gion de KOULIKORO.\nISSA   n\u2019a pas eu la chance  d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole.

There's also a deficit of protein in the barley fodder, but it's necessary from June through November, the low-water months.  So in these critical periods he has to improve the nutrition of his dairy cows by using corn flour, soy chaff, bran, and other supplements.\r\n\r\nRaymundo's dream is to have more cattle.\r\n\r\nThis

She is pictured here, standing on the right with her hand raised, with two other One Acre Fund group-leader farmers. The field officer, also included in the photo, is standing on the left. These group leaders represent 43 individual One Acre Fund farmer, who are not pictured here.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJackline, 32, has been a farmer for 20 years. She works to provide for her four children. The community and other farmers know her as hardworking and trustworthy and as an experienced farmer. Other than farming, she is involved in community activities such as the women's group and the prayer group. As an active community member, she has also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative. \r\n\r\nJackline describes her harvest last year as good but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group. She joined One Acre Fund because she wants to be rich in farming. She has been selected as the Kiva group representative. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving a quarter acre of maize and a quarter acre of sorghum or millet, which is an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJackline first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season. She has joined this season to get the best seed prices and to earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school. She plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for farmers.  Her own life has improved because she has more profits from her harvests and has been able to save money and feed her family too. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJackline and the Mkulima Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. The organization will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments on their loan. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1486506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To access hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chrispinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":230007,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230007}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2675,"local_amount":230007,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-28T10:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":231652.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722843}],"funded_date":"2014-01-27T06:33:50Z","paid_date":"2014-12-28T10:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":654950,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabel is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fruits and vegetables vending business in the Philippines.

He is pictured here in a group of 6 One Acre Fund group farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 56 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  David has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid is married and has 4 children.  He is 34 years old and is known as trustworthy.  He is active in his community in groups such as the Men's Group and Burial Committee.  David has been a farmer for 12 years.  David described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  David joined One Acre Fund in order to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and wants to help more farmers.  David plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and to buy a goat.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  David\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n \r\nDavid and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1486886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T13:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T13:50:05Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Masinde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tobias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dismas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simiyu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":299544,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3475,"local_amount":299544,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-28T10:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":300931.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722844}],"funded_date":"2014-02-07T13:25:38Z","paid_date":"2014-12-28T10:32:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":643329,"name":"Seng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seng is 56 years old and a citizen from Kandal Stoeung district of Kandal province where he rice farms on a one and half hectare area.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 78 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Reginalda is pictured on the right of the Bidii Group with her hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nReginalda is 51 years old and has been a farmer for 30 years. Reginalda works as a farmer to provide for her two children. The community and other farmers know Reginalda as reliable and trustworthy.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community in the women's group and prayer group. Reginalda described her harvest last year as good, but she hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nReginalda first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Reginalda joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member.  Reginalda plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Reginalda\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from her harvest, and was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nReginalda and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

Martin has been a farmer for 30 years. \r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMartin is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Martin joined One Acre Fund so that he could get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family. Martin has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Martin's life because he has more farm training.  In the future, Martin hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school. \r\n\r\nMartin and the Toloso Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":1486876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T14:50:06Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bramwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muyekho","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":406524,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406524}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4700,"local_amount":406524,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-29T10:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":407014.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722845}],"funded_date":"2014-02-01T17:52:14Z","paid_date":"2014-12-29T10:31:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":655006,"name":"Rosemary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Rosemary.

For that reason, Rafia has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan. On getting a profit, first of all she will repay the loan amount to Kiva and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is too much congested. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that her business grows more and she is very much thankful to both Brac and Kiva.

He is pictured here in a group of 10 One Acre Fund group l farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 94 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Patrick has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatrick is married and has 16 children. He is 60 years old and is known as hardworking. He is active in his community in groups such as the prayer group. Patrick has been a farmer for 32 years. Patrick described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatrick first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2008 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Patrick joined One Acre Fund in order to learn new farming methods. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Patrick plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Patrick\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training. \r\n\r\nPatrick and the Khalundu Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5825,"image":{"id":1486867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T15:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T15:10:09Z","loan_amount":5825,"lender_count":177,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepter","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sellah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":502806,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502806}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5825,"local_amount":502806,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-29T10:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":504438.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722846}],"funded_date":"2014-02-03T19:28:21Z","paid_date":"2014-12-29T10:31:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neil Garvin","image":835015}},{"id":655022,"name":"Tariel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tariel is a 52-year-old married man, who lives in Samtredia.

Konul believes her loan will have a positive effect on her business and allow her to expand.

Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 74 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid is 70 years old, married, and has seven children.  He is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, and trustworthy.  He is active in his community groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  David has been a farmer for five years.  He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  David joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family, and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  David plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  David\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  David and the Amani Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T15:50:04Z","loan_amount":4575,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydiah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johnstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":395826,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395826}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":655051,"name":"Phuong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phuong would like to take a further loan to buy more noodles, meat and other ingredients to make meals to sell from her stall.

She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.  \r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHarriet is a reliable member of the community.  She is married and the mother of two children. She is 29 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 10 years to support her family. In addition to this, Harriet is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. She said that her harvest last year as not with the One Acre Fund.  She hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer she will be able to double her harvest in their first year of the program!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHarriet and the Baraka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. The Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from their\u2019 harvests. The One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, the One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to the Fund. With support from the One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":1486917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T16:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T16:10:08Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Scovian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annelice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":401175,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4650,"local_amount":401175,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-30T10:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":402685.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722847}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T16:29:18Z","paid_date":"2014-12-30T10:31:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":643358,"name":"Kwekwe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kwekwe is a hardworking and enterprising woman who lives in the Coastal region of Kenya.

Rosemary, pictured here on the right of the photo with her hand raised, is the group\u2019s Kiva representative. She is 44 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years. She is a farmer to provide for her six children. The community and other farmers know Rosemary as friendly and a hardworking farmer. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community in the women's group and the prayer group. Rosemary described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nRosemary joined One Acre Fund in 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. She joined One Acre Fund to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and send children to school. Because she is a leader and an active community member who wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Rosemary has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved her life because she has more profits from harvest and has more farm group support. In the future, Rosemary hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and repair her home.  \t\t\r\n\r\nRosemary and the Budobe Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.
