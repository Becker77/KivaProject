With this third loan she plans to achieve a monthly income of 115,000 West African Francs, which will be used to bolster her business capital, contribute to the family budget and pay off the interest on her loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":579829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"A\u00efssata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40515.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180829},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476800},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613509},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751941},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606193},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917866},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360795}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T09:41:35Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":224708,"name":"Tilekberdi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tilekberdi U. is 36 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Bayan-Ulgiy province in western Mongolia.

She is married and her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. In addition, he works as a driver for the taxi the family owns. Manar wants to change the taxi engine motor to let it work more efficiently and increase the family income. She also wants to purchase some home appliances she needs such as a refrigerator, gas, etc, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for these expenses so she needs to take a loan of $2,386.67 from FATEN. When Manar takes the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to change the taxi engine motor to a new one, which enables her husband to work extra hours and increase the family income. Manar will also purchase the home appliances she needs and that will improve her life and she will be able to live with her family in better conditions. Manar is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead next to the taxi the family owns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

Let\u2019s help her continue fighting to keep her family together and to accomplish her goal. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>Para Do\u00f1a Teresa las cosas hasta hace un tiempo fueron duras y de constante sufrimiento, la persona que se convertir\u00eda en su esposo y con el que deseaba formar un hogar  estable y lleno de amor, siempre la maltrat\u00f3 f\u00edsica y psicol\u00f3gicamente en presencia de sus hijos durante mucho tiempo. \r\n\r\nCuando ella decidi\u00f3 terminar con estos actos busc\u00f3 ayuda y se march\u00f3 para establecerse en otra ciudad muy lejos de su natal Pucallpa; poco a poco y con mucho esfuerzo los hijos de Teresa fueron recobrando la calma y felicidad que hace mucho tiempo les arrebat\u00f3 el hombre que les dio la vida.\r\n\r\nEl incansable esp\u00edritu luchador la hizo emprender un peque\u00f1o negocio en el interior de la vivienda que habitaba; y jam\u00e1s se imagin\u00f3 que con el tiempo se convertir\u00eda en una de las m\u00e1s concurridas por el incomparable servicio que les ofrece.\r\nY como la poblaci\u00f3n se va imcrementando cada vez m\u00e1s porque se establecen m\u00e1s familias en las zonas aleda\u00f1as mayor es la demanda por los art\u00edculos de primera necesidad que ofrece en su peque\u00f1a tienda Teresa.\r\n\r\nCon el deseo de incrementar la cantidad de productos que ofrece hasta la fecha ella solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de 275 d\u00f3lares con el compromiso de retornarlos en un per\u00edodo de 6 meses.\r\n\r\nHagamos que ese esp\u00edritu siga luchando por mantener a su familia unida con el cumplimiento de su anhelo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":68044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a more varied stock for her small general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-09-26T06:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-10T06:37:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-11-10T10:21:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79526},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T10:24:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94803},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-01-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113333},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-02-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132821},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154858},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":179104}],"funded_date":"2007-09-26T06:37:58Z","paid_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23117,"name":"Identity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The entrepreneur is 40 years old.

L\u00f3pez is 65 years old, single, and has seven children (whom are not dependent upon her). One of her dreams is to keep her business going, since it helps to provide opportunity for her children and fulfill their needs.  She plans to improve her home since she does not have adequate space for cooking - the space she uses is actually a wood-burning oven. She is working hard and saving money up to fulfill her plans since construction materials are expensive.  \r\n\r\nShe's had her tortilla-selling business, located in the Subtiava Barrio, for 20 years, which she started with one bag of corn and a price of 25 cents for tortillas. She raised the price as times became difficult but she was still able to grow her client base and that's how her business grew to its current size. This loan is for capital which she needs to buy firewood and corn, among other things. She is grateful to work with the Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and the partner organizations as they are very supportive in helping their clients succeed.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":242155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T19:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia Celina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858679},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399934},{"amount":78.75,"local_amount":1470.09,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1559.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091920},{"amount":6.95,"local_amount":129.91,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":137.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985317},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445928},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956575},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174003}],"funded_date":"2008-12-20T21:13:29Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Carreon","image":90574}},{"id":84580,"name":"Abdurafik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdurafik is married with two kids.

Abdurafik is very enterprising, has vast experience working as a vendor, and is full of creative ideas. A reasonable pricing policy and client-friendly service have always been priorities in his work and have helped to ensure the success of his business. <P>\r\n\r\nAbdurafik has been running his business for many years. He was only 12 when he started to help his mother with her market business, then afterward when he became an adult, he started his own business. In general he has 12 years of experience selling clothing. Currently, Abdurafik is requesting a loan of 800 USD to increase his inventory. He promises to repay the loan within 11 months. He believes that having this additional turnover capital will help him minimize his sales risk and provide stable financial support for his family. Moreover, it will help him get closer to his ultimate goal of purchasing a big store of his own. <P>\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been in business off and on since 1981. She started by selling rolled cotton. Her beginning capital was US$ 7. Her first business prospered but lasted only for six months due to the lack of goods on the market. \r\n\r\nMonique had to change businesses. She started selling rice and soaps at the market, but was severely impacted when the Congolese Franc lost its value in 1981. She lost all of her capital and went to take care of her family until 2003.\r\n\r\nMonique launched another business in 2003. She started selling beverages, cakes and waffles until 2007 when she joined one of Hope\u2019s groups called \u201cLoboko\u201d meaning \u201cHand\u201d in English. Through her sales, Monique makes about US$ 70 per week. Monique plans to use her loan from Hope to diversify her business and sell salted and smoked fish and mushrooms. In order to increase her income, Monique has various points of sale within her community. She dreams one day of putting up a large business building that she can rent out for additional income.  \r\n\r\nMonique is 64 years old, married, and a mother of twelve children between the ages of 22 and 46; two of her children are sick and stay with her. The rest of her children are independent. In spite of her age, Monique likes selling because it gives her the opportunity to make contact with many different people, and once they become permanent customers, she is able to offer them quality products at a better price and they keep coming back.

She really wants to get ahead in life, and this is why she works so hard.  Since she was very young she has concerned herself with finding ways to make money, which she learned from her parents.  Currently she sells alpaca wool in a market in the city of Juliaca.  Her wool is of a very high quality, so it sells very quickly.  It is very tiring for Reina to take all the wool to market, and this is the hardest part of her work.  But she knows that he has to do it to earn money, which she will eventually use to buy a car in order to transport the wool more easily.  She has been doing this for four years, and what she likes best is selling and chatting with her customers, who are always seeking her out.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she always made her payments on time, and says that this loan will be no exception.  She wants to eventually take out more loans which she will use to improve her business.  She knows very well that in her communal bank, they will support and guide her, because she is a well-loved member of the group.

She has one son, but he is married and makes his own living. She sells hammocks and has a small grocery store. She opened the grocery store in her home with money she was able to save up bit by bit. Gerarda used to help her mother when her mother made hammocks . That\u2019s why when Gerarda started her own household, this was the occupation that helped her to earn an income for her family. Since then, she has never slowed in her production of hammocks, and this small business helped her start another one. She has learned to fight and start over when there aren\u2019t any other options. Gerarda has now been presented with the opportunity to increase her sales even more, but she doesn\u2019t have all of the materials that she needs to make a large number of hammocks and the earnings from her grocery store also wouldn\u2019t be enough for the costs she would incur.

The members' expectations are to have a productive business that will give their families a higher quality of life and give their children a better education. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":390298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4525,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Nela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Percy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola  Giovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eddy Janeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":31500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2462.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2491.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2519.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2548.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2578.32},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2607.99},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2638},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2668.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2699.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2730.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2761.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2793.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":353.81},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.16},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.64},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.95},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":392.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Schapiro","image":null}},{"id":141994,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia es socia del Banco Comunal Morenita.\nJulia es casada, tiene 48 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Julia tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes y bebidas, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda de su hija.

After having run many businesses without success, she decided in the end to become introduced to buying and selling food items five years ago.\u00a0 She operates her business in front of her home in M\u00e9dine Sikasso, where she is much appreciated by her customers for the quality of her goods.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two months ago.\u00a0 She is now on her first individual loan, which she intends to use to buy from suppliers:\u00a0 50 boxes of mineral water, 35 packets of NBB drinks, 30 cases of BRAMALI drinks, 20 boxes of canned drinks of various kinds, and other items.\u00a0 She purchases her goods locally and sells to customers composed of women and young people, cash or credit accepted, particularly during this period leading up to the holidays (Tabaski, Christmas, and New Year).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the interest on her loan.\u00a0 The rest will be invested into her business.\u00a0 \r\n<br

located in the central valley of Costa Rica. \r\n\r\nMerida has completed a two year program in the art of beauty\/cosmetics. She has combined her educational background and her entrepreneurial instincts to open a beauty salon. Merida offers hair services such as styling, cutting, coloring and other hair related services, as well as nail services (manicures, pedicures etc.)  She plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of various beauty products\/tools such as hair dryers, a hair straightener, scissors, creams, shampoos, nail polish, etc. Merida started her business five years ago with a loan she shared with a friend. This loan will be her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nOver the past year, Merida has been focused on raising her newborn son. As a result, she has been working half time at her salon. This loan will mark the return to full time work for Merida, as she aims to transform this loan into profits. Full time business hours are from 9:00AM to 6:00PM, Monday to Saturday, and Merida works alone.  The months of October, November and December are the busiest in the beauty industry. Merida can count on anywhere between 60 to 100 regular clients who make monthly visits during this time. Merida\u00b4s services are sought not only by members of her immediate community, but by clients in neighbourung communities who travel to visit her salon (San Jose, San Carlos, Guanacaste). These clients have helped to keep her business flourishing as there are a number of beauty salons in the area, creating high levels of competition for clients.\r\n\r\n In an effort to differentiate her salon from those of her competitors, Merida would like to invest in an automatic nail painter. This machine paints nails quickly and with intricate designs. The machine is quite expensive, so Merida will not be putting the current loan towards such a machine, possibly the next loan.\r\n\r\nIn general, Merida wakes up early, prepares breakfast for her husband and son, and carries out domestic tasks. From 9:00AMto 6:00PM she will be working in the salon, with an hour lunch break.

Since Claudio\u2019s move to the United States 20 years ago, he has worked on farms in upstate New York and found seasonal employment at different factories during the winter months. Fascinated by the variety of produce that is grown in the U.S., Claudio made a decision seven years ago to rent land and start a farm of his own farm \u2013 sustained with support from the Grow NYC New Farmer Development program.  \n\nWhen Hurricane Irene swept through upstate New York \u2013 devastating crops from Claudio's farm \u2013 it was his loyal Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) members that took immediate action to save his business. By collectively pooling their savings, Claudio\u2019s CSA was able offset lost income and monetary damages and kept Claudio\u2019s farm from going under. This demonstration of un-coerced, homegrown support is no less organic than the farm fresh vegetables Claudio has been selling for over seven years. With a variety of over 50 types of vegetables sold at six different markets throughout New York City, Claudio has amassed a dedicated following of patrons that can quickly discern the quality of Claudio\u2019s produce. \n\nIn 2011, Claudio searched for loan capital to help cover the cost of his next batch of seedlings for the spring, but like other immigrant entrepreneurs, a short credit history made it challenging for him to secure funding for his business. As a member of Grow NYC, Claudio attended a financing workshop on Dec. 1 and met ACCION USA Business Development Officer Erica Dorn, who saw potential in Claudio\u2019s business. \u201cI really saw some strengths in Claudio, particularly with his business momentum and strong CSA relationships,\u201d said Erica. Looking beyond Claudio\u2019s credit score, ACCION USA approved a microloan for seedlings, helping Claudio to stabilize his business during tough winter months.

With her savings, Isabel would like to buy a house, as she now rents her home. Isabel would also like to expand her business while her children are still small. Isabel has many dreams, for example, she hopes to be the perfect mother for her children, and she\u2019d like her children to be professionals. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEl Bancomunal Santa Rosa esta formado por 11 clientas, esta ubicado en la comunidad de Cangallo, capital del distrito de Cangallo en el departamento de Ayacucho, esta comunidad  mayormente se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de frutales, pero es poco  la producci\u00f3n de cereales y la mayor\u00eda de la gente se dedica al negocio.\r\n<p>\r\nMaruja C., tiene un molino de  granos, se dedica  a  criar  cuyes  en casa  con  el desperdicio del  molino y  vende mor\u00f3n, ulpeada y 7  semillas.

Anor is 44 years old and is married with five children. Anor is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of large livestock at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife (pictured) and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Anor is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional $650 in his business. In order to receive this amount, Anor has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

has worked as a butcher and a cook for 16 years. People often told him that his cooking was so good he should make a business out of it. Last year, James started his own catering business in a church kitchen. He makes and sells tamales and smoked meats, including ribs, links, lamb, duck, and goat. \r\n\r\nOne of James\u2019 main challenges is the high cost of cooking and catering equipment. He can only afford to purchase a little at a time. He is proud to have purchased his smoker, his biggest purchase so far, with his own savings. \r\n\r\nJames needs a loan to help him purchase a mobile food cart. He plans to sell his tamales and meats in California parks, so people will know where to find him and his products. In the future, James hopes to have his own kitchen so that he can expand his business to its full potential, including a staff of two employees. \r\n\r\nJames is excited about working wtih Opportunity Fund, not only for the chance of getting a loan to buy the cart, but also for teaching him important business skills to help him run and expand his business effectively.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Feliciano is the means of support of his family.  From a young age his parents taught him to work on the farm.  Now he has a plot of land with coffee plants.  He has been working his own land for 23 years, and at harvest time he counts on the help of his children and on the labor of day laborers to make quicker progress with the extraction of the fruit.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his job is harvesting the fruit of the plants because in this way he feels that the months of hard work pay him back with the quality of fruit.  He considers the hardest part to be transporting his products from the farm to the distribution centers located in the city of San Francisco, where they offer better prices for his coffee beans.  The difficulty Feliciano has is not being able to have enough income to make the payments in advance to the day laborers who help him with the harvests.  This is why he turns to the loans that the MFP institution facilitates.  But now what he gives priority to is planting more coffee plants.\r\n\r\nThis will be his eighth loan with MFP.  He feels that the money from the loan will help him a lot in the progress of his work.  In his communal bank he is a member who is well loved by the rest of his companions because is is very supportive with them.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,000 PEN he will buy coffee plants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":980566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feliciano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455467}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T21:22:32Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":425755,"name":"Otilio","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"El  Se\u00f1or Otilio, tiene 61 a\u00f1os de edad,  tiene 4 hijos y vive con su esposa, Su actividad principal es el comercio cuenta con una carnicer\u00eda donde vende carne de res  desde hace m\u00e1s de 6 A\u00f1os, Don Otilio, esta solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de reses para el destazo  para satisfacer la demanda de su clientela, su negocio esta ubicado en un lugar muy estrat\u00e9gico por donde transitan varios personas a sus domicilios y aldeas cercanas lo que le permite contar con muy buena clientela, con el pr\u00e9stamo que reciba Don Otilio, le contribuir\u00e1 a tener un mejor surtido y calidad de carne en su negocio y as\u00ed obtener mejores ingresos para cubrir los gastos en el hogar y darle una mejor calidad de vida a su familia para que salga adelante y brindarles una mejor educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos, Don Otilio trabaja los d\u00edas domingo en su carnicer\u00eda ya que es el d\u00eda con el que las personas que trabajan en los diferentes centros trabajos de la zona reciben sueldo y los dem\u00e1s d\u00edas le permite realizar tareas agr\u00edcolas y comprar las reses que destazara el fin de semana,\nUno de sus sue\u00f1os de Don Otilio es contar con un local que re\u00fana todas las exigencia sanitarias en su negocio y brindarle una mejor atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes.\nDanli El Para\u00edso, Honduras -

She is 48 years old. Aquilinia is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Aquilinia owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector selling crabs in the local community. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crabs to tourists and local community members. Aquilinia has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine Pesos (about $62 US) a month for these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2009, Aquilinia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aquilinia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 pesos which will be used to purchase additional crabs to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Aquilinia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<P>\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\n<P>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

When she received her previous loans, she invested the money in buying and selling of RTW (ready-to-wear-clothes) and later expanded the business with more inventory. For supplementary income, she is also embarked in an Electronic Loading business such as Smart load, Globe load, and Sun load.\r\n\r\nNow on her 3rd loan, she requested 10,000 PHP as additional working capital for her E-load business. She is positive that her businesses will grow since she already has regular customers requesting orders from her RTW and solid clients of her E-loading business at home.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a permanent space in the marketplace where she can sell her RTW products as well as provide satisfactory E-loading to her customers. She hopes to have successful businesses that can provide her with a good life that is moving away from the poverty line. \r\n\r\nTheresa T. is a 47-year-old woman from town of Binangonan, Rizal Province in the Philippines.

S. is a 42-year-old pepper producer and mother of five who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. Hilda is a dedicated mother and producer. She plans to focus her efforts on the planting and harvest of Tabasco peppers. Hilda works in cooperation with her family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. In general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the morning, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and caring for younger siblings. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvest and planting \u2013 working the land as needed. The land they work is their own. \n\nHilda\u00b4s husband works at a local orange producing factory as a harvesting labourer in order to supplement family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and buys food. The rural zone where Hilda and her family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Hilda is working hard towards the sustenance of her family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from her land and labour. \n\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Hilda and her family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\n\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Tabasco peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labour and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Hilda with the help of her family members in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles, located in the Northern Region of Costa Rica. Hilda will need roughly one year before her peppers will reach maturity and be ready for harvest. In the past, it has been difficult for Hilda to gain access to financial services and technical advice regarding farming practices. This has been a factor that has hindered his ability to be as productive as possible. \n\n\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan.

Ismael owns a sweets shop where he makes local sweets out of Semolina dough, cheese and sugar, such as Kunafa. Ismael started his shop three years ago.\r\n\r\nIsmael wanted to double his production due to an increase in demand and business prosperity, so he came to FATEN and took a loan to purchase sugar, coconut, nuts, cheese and fat. Ismael has long experience making local sweets and has a good number of clients.\r\n\r\nIsmael appears in the picture here in his shop.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

They will be sold door to door to customers who are mostly women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she is planning on making a monthly profit of 100, 000 Francs CFA that will be mostly used to increase her

He sells used clothing and shoes in a stall in the center of Barranquilla. He has been doing this work for 16 years. He started off helping his parents with this work. When his father passed away, he became his mother's main source of support. When she passed away, he became the owner of the business. David purchases merchandise from various providers in Barranquilla neighbourhoods who trade used clothing and shoes for cooking utensils such as pots, pans, bowls and glasses. His main customers are people with few resources from the city and peasants from rural areas. He always takes care to buy clothing that is in good condition, without tears, patches or stains. Sometimes he washes and irons them so that they are like new. Around his business there are other people who do the same work, but each one has their own providers and customer base. This is David's third loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to invest it in purchasing more used clothing and shoes. His daily sales average $100,000 and his margin of utility is 35%. The December season is the best of the year and he needs to increase his working capital. His wife also daily produces various lunches that she sells to merchants in the sector. David's greatest satisfaction is having been able to raise his three children without hardship, and having achieved the fact that next year his youngest daughter will graduate from nursing school. He says, with a great sense of humour, that selling used clothing and shoes allows his family to buy new clothes and shoes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":680027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She is 41 years old and is the group leader of this Four-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if they are delinquent or default.\r\n\r\nLiza is married and has four school-aged children. She owns and operates a retail business, selling dried fish in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Liza joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and used towards working capital.\r\n\r\nLiza is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase dried fish to expand her business offering. This will be her third loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":743161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She only had a few clients at first, but later with time and with her good customer service, her business began to grow.<p>\r\nWith school out for the summer, she wants to make sure her van is well-maintained in order to avoid any type of accidents (disrepair) once school is back in session. This is why she is requesting a loan in the amount of $750 USD.  She commits to repay this amount within 6 months.  Sandra thanks you for giving her an opportunity to improve her business!<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEn la localidad de Santa Catrarina, Nuevo Le\u00f3n vive Sandra, ella es una mujer muy trabajadora, es soltera y tiene dos hijos.

She bakes bread and pastries and sells them to the villages around her. Demand for her products has increased as a result of constant supply and just in time delivery.

A sizeable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. However, quite an appreciable number of the women are engaged in palm oil production. Samuel identified this as a business opportunity and bought three sets of palm nut milling and processing machines to run a commercial palm nut processing business in his community. \r\n\r\nHe has one set of machines that pounds the cooked palm nuts and another one that extracts the oil from the palm nut fibre. His services have greatly reduced the drudgery that was previously associated with palm oil extraction and processing.\r\n\r\nSince palm oil production is assuming a greater scale in his community, he seeks loan assistance to enable him to buy additional milling and processing machines and accessories to provide satisfactory, timely production service to his clients. He believes the loan assistance would enable him to scale up production to serve a larger market and eventually, to help improve his family\u2019s finances.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband is an animal breeder. \r\nIn 1997, in need of an additional source of income, Altynai began a business selling fruits and vegetables.

The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste materials to various processing factories which in turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials. Waste recycling undertaken by Rusmini and her husband thus helps clean the environment by reusing waste material which otherwise would go to the landfills. In a day Rusmini can earn $60.

Thi Mai had started planning with her husband, Thanh Van Nguyen, to join the Tinh Thuong Fund which focuses entirely on agricultural ventures.  From then on the couple decided to  borrow money to invest in raising livestock.  In every funding round the couple had used the money to invest in livestock.  With this focus, the family\u2019s finances have improved markedly and they have been able to afford more conveniences.  Mrs. Mai\u2019s son earns an average of 2,500,000 VND per month from his work, and this amount is used to make the weekly payment to the Fund.  Extra income is put towards larger and more important uses.  In this round of funding the family is requesting 13,000,000 VND to invest in raising pigs.  The family\u2019s average income is 4,000,000 per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNgay t\u1eeb nh\u01b0ng ng\u00e0y \u0111\u1ea7u Qu\u1ef9 tri\u1ec3n khai tr\u00ean \u0111\u1ecba b\u00e0n th\u00f4n nh\u00e0, ch\u1ecb Mai Th\u1ecb Ki\u1ec1m \u0111\u00e3 b\u00e0n b\u1ea1c c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng l\u00e0 anh Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thanh, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng, v\u1edbi m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ecba ph\u01b0\u01a1ng thu\u1ea7n n\u00f4ng ngu\u1ed3n thu nh\u1eadp ch\u00ednh ho\u00e0n to\u00e0n ph\u1ee5 thu\u1ed9c v\u00e0o n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p.
