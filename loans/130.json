This is 33 year old Nsia I. M.. She is married with three children between the ages of 2 and 8. \r\n\r\nNsia is quite the entrepreneur as she runs two businesses: a kuku (poultry) business and a tailoring business.  Seems a bit unrelated to the average person, but it makes sense here in Tanzania. A kuku business is a simple, profitable, and popular business here in Tanzania. You simply buy chicks, tend to them for 5 weeks, and then sell them in the market. It does not take all day to tend to the chickens, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, so a go-getter like Nsia also has time to run another business. Her tailoring business is a bit more complicated as she needs to properly measure and sew outfits to her customers' specifications, and customers can be quite demanding!\r\n\r\nHer businesses are doing well and her monthly profits are approximately US$600. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional chicks and feed for her kuku business, as well as materials for making clothes for her tailoring business. She thanks you in advance for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":248313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

She has 3 grown children who have their own families. One of her daughters lives with her. <p>\r\nShe stated that she has always liked retail and that she used to have a general store at home that was well-stocked and had many customers. Her husband helped her with the income at the time, buying and selling fruits and vegetables throughout the neighborhoods of Lambar\u00e9, Asunci\u00f3n, as well as other places further inland. He had a truck to do this work. <p>\r\nShe went on to say that she had to close her general store due to the fact that her husband became very ill and she had to attend to him since he was hospitalized for a long time. <p>\r\nShe currently has the support of one of her children who works selling and buying merchandise, and seasonal fruits and vegetables. She states that this line of work requires a lot of sacrifice because she has to leave her house very early in the morning to shop for products, then travel throughout the Chaco zone because there are few suppliers who visit the small businesses there. <p>\r\nShe also likes to sew in her free time, which is why she works with a company who provides her with the raw materials needed to make different types of towels. These two sources of income are helping her, and little by little, she is investing in home improvement. <p>\r\nShe likes to work with microloans because they allow her access to greater benefits when

Es un lugar en donde la mayor parte de la poblaci\u00f3n fundamenta su econom\u00eda en cultivo y venta de verdura, son personas muy trabajadoras. El grupo est\u00e1 conformado por  10 integrantes y es la TERCERA vez que solicita un cr\u00e9dito a CrediCom\u00fan. \nEsta foto fu\u00e9 tomada en la casa de la Sra. Rosa Mar\u00eda D. E., donde se hacen las reuniones semanales. Se ve el trabajo que realiza la Sra. Rosa Mar\u00eda D. E. quien es la primera de derecha a izquierda en la foto. Tiene 48 a\u00f1os; en la primaria solo aprendi\u00f3 a leer y a escribir, se dedica a la venta de bolsas de mandado, a la costura y art\u00edculos por temporada principalmente, lo comercializa en las plazas (tianguis) de los diferentes municipios, como lo es Atlacomulco, Ixtlahuaca, El oro por mencionar algunos, tiene 22 a\u00f1os dedic\u00e1ndose a estas actividades, menciona que el cr\u00e9dito le ha servido para invertir en su negocio y eso ha permitido darle la oportunidad de estudiar la universidad a 1 de sus 6 hijos por el momento, pero tiene planeado seguir trabajando arduamente como lo ha venido haciendo por a\u00f1os, para darle esas misma oportunidad a los otros 3 hijos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os ya que desafortunadamente a 2 de los mayores no tuvo la oportunidad de darles estudio, siempre busca la diversificaci\u00f3n de su producto de acuerdo a lo que los clientes le piden.\nSolicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de bolsas, ajos, hilos, telas y sombreros. Sus compa\u00f1eras comentan que la Sra. Rosa Mar\u00eda D. E. se ha superado gracias a su negocio y a la dedicaci\u00f3n.  \nSu principal objetivo en la vida es dejarles una gran herencia a sus hijos que es el estudio para que puedan tener una vida mejor.

Here the majority of the population have an economic base in the cultivation and sale of vegetables.  These are very hard working people.  The group is composed of 10 members and this is the 3rd time they have solicited a loan from CrediComun.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken in the house of Mrs. Rosa Maria where their weekly reunions are held. Let's look at the Rosa Maria's work. She is the 1st person right to left in the photo.  She is 48 years old and only learned to read and write in primary school.  She sells pockets ordered by dressmakers and seasonal articles, primarily in the public markets of different municipalities, like Atlacomulco, Istlahuaca, and El Oro, to mention a few.  Rosa Maria has been doing this for 22 years.  She mentions that previous loans invested in her business have given 1 of her 6 children the opportunity to study in the university at present, and she plans to continue working assiduously as she has been doing for years, to give this same opportunity to the 3 youngest children, since, unfortunately, the 2 oldest never had the chance to study.  She always looks for ways to diversify her products in accord with her customers' demands.\r\n\r\nRosa Maria is requesting the loan to purchase sewing materials, cloth, and hats.  Her companions comment that she has gotten ahead thanks to her business and her dedication.  Her principal objective in life is to provide a heritage to her children, which is an education that will offer them a better life. This is the admirable thing about the women who make up these different groups, that despite the difficulties they face, always, their primary goal is the education of their children.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nCarmela L. R.        (sale of plastics)\r\nAntonia S. L.      (sale of hats)\r\nJosefina B. S.\r\nLourdes D. E.      (sale of meals)\r\nOlivia S. D.\r\nLisbeth D. D.

This community is in a mountainous region very close to the northern border of the country.

She has a place close to her house where she has her own clothing store, which she has gradually developed over time.  However, she tells us that the lack of financing has been an obstacle to growth.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Melania needs a loan of 300,000 Costa Rican colones, to buy more clothing and improve the condition of her shop.  With this loan, she will make her store look better and be able to offer more options to her customers, who say that they are very satisfied with the new store.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the communal bank \"Manantial de Santa Fe,\" one of the 100 organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica.

Talangnan, Madredijos, Cebu City.  She is marred to Jershon Alfonso C. III, 35 years old, and they have six children, ages 2- 12. Emma has three businesses: a chicken barbecue business, a dried locust business, and a fishing business. Her husband works in the chicken barbecue field and helps his wife with her business activities.  \r\n\r\nEmma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, and uplifted the family's standard of living. Emma's 14th cycle loan of PHP 28,000 will be used to buy a new pump boat for her fishing business. With her earnings, she will continue to save for the future, provide good education for her children and to improve their living conditions. Emma C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

What she most enjoys about her work is being able to pick her bananas every two weeks as she feels glad to be making profits.  She has 4 years experience in this business and, over time, she has managed to obtain good annual profits from her coffee crops which she sells in the city of Villarica.  She has also been able to obtain a car that she uses to provide a public transport service.  This helps her with her daily household expenses.  Now Luz is planning to start a business selling meat and dairy products since there is a lot of demand during the coffee season.  These products are needed to prepare meals for the staff who work on all the different ranches.\r\n\r\nLuz belongs to the \"Desarrollando para el Progreso de Prisma\" community bank and this is her first loan from MFP.  She is certain that she will be able to achieve her goals.  Luz is investing her working capital in her next coffee harvest.  For this reason, she will use her loan money to buy several kilos of freshwater fish and cheese from the mountains so that she can start her business selling meals to farm laborers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":734293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish and cheese","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-21T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":761.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850719}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T03:08:53Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":287443,"name":"Pace\u00f1itas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cPACE\u00d1ITAS\u201d iniciar\u00e1 su decimo quinto  ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Alto Lima.

For many years, she has also been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute an additional source of income for her family.  Karkyra successfully repaid her first loan and used her money according to its intended purpose.  She now has three cows on her farm and she grows peppers and clover on 0.2 hectares of her own land and two hectares of leased land.

She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":129410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Prior to that she had already worked in various enterprises making wedding apparel:  dresses and suites, et cetera.  In her second place of employment she was encouraged to propose to her boss that they make costumes for sell or rent.  Her boss liked the idea and today they are no longer in the business of wedding apparel, but the costume business.  Realizing how profitable the sale and rental of costumes could be Norma decided to branch out on her own after purchasing their industrial sewing machines.  Today, with 20 years of experience working for others and 15 years working for herself, Norma continues to expand her business.  Nowadays, she provides sewing services to the previous company for which she worked, pursues her own business renting and selling costumes and, as if that were not enough, in the past few months has invested in the wholesale tuna trade.  This latest is thanks to a partnership with her nephew, the owner of a tuna cannery.

She lives in a monogamous family with her husband and children in the Bagadadji district of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  For societal reasons, she dropped out of school to get married.  Since being a student, she worked in commerce with her mother, who used to sell honey.  After several years at her mother\u2019s side, she acquired solid experience, which enabled her to fly on wings of her own.  \r\n<p>\r\nImproving by herself and working at many kinds of jobs, such as selling fish, meat kebabs, and <i>galettes<\/i>, she decided in the end to become specialized in the clothing business.  She has been in this business for 22 years and enjoys a large customer base and fame at the S\u00e9bougou marketplace and in the district where she lives, there where customers come to buy at her house.  Her clothing is of good quality and popular.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo increase her working capital, Sitan has turned to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 48 months.  After four solidarity loans and two individual loans, all repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.\r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to use this loan to buy twelve outfits of rich damask fabric of different colors from dye experts in Bamako, the capital of Mali.  She makes her sales to customers composed of men and women, cash or credit accepted.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe hopes to realize a monthly profit of 35,000 francs CFA that will enable her to pay the <i>tontines<\/i> (community revolving savings and loan groups), to participate in societal events, and to cover certain family expenses.

Now, they are laborers and are helping Tomasa in managing her business. \r\nTomasa\u2019s determination for growing her business became more intense because she wants to secure the future of her two children despite their low attainment in education.

Para la muestra, Tormenta, la tienda de C\u00e9sar y su esposa, es un sitio donde un paisa encuentra su escencia, pues est\u00e1 ubicada al lado de un club de socios de caballo que con sus familias componen gran parte de su clientela, all\u00ed se divierten y consumen alimentos, refrescos y otros productos que puede encontrar a cualquier hora del d\u00eda y de la noche. En la tienda Tormenta, nombre en honor  a un caballo muy especial,  observa colgadas en las paredes, hermosas  fotograf\u00edas de estos especimenes  que deleitan la vista de los aficionados y hacen de este lugar el perfecto para  compartir intereses paisas comunes y donde se integran tambi\u00e9n gran parte de los vecinos solede\u00f1os (de Soledad Atl\u00e1ntico) y otros que vienen desde Barranquilla.\n\nComo una persona \"echada para adelante\" y con amplia capacidad de riesgo, se describe a si mismo C\u00e9sar V\u00e1squez, jefe de familia de 30 a\u00f1os y propietario de esta tienda- estadero del barrio Centenario en el municipio de Soledad, donde trabaja hombro a hombro al lado de su esposa,  ambos de origen antioque\u00f1o de Granada y de C\u00e1ceres respectivamente; tienen dos  hijos de 13 y 4 a\u00f1os, que son el motor que los impulsa  a trabajar continuamente para verlos convertir en profesionales y para que cuenten con todas las herramientas para enfrentar la vida de manera independiente, persistir  y progresar , venciendo los obst\u00e1culos que se le presenten.\n\nCesar lleva grabada la imagen de su padre tambi\u00e9n paisa, como un excelente trabajador y hombre sabio que sacaba cuentas como un experto; aunque este  siempre impuls\u00f3 a Cesar al estudio, este \u00faltimo se inclin\u00f3 desde muy joven por el trabajo,  por eso empez\u00f3 con su padre su primera labor en  el campo, donde desarroll\u00f3 la gran capacidad que hoy posee; de \u00e9l aprendi\u00f3 el manejo de cuentas y ahora lo hace con una habilidad natural, que todos los d\u00edas potencia con su negocio.\n\nEste es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; cuando empez\u00f3 con esta organizaci\u00f3n solo ten\u00eda un estadero, con este cr\u00e9dito compr\u00f3 estanter\u00edas y mercanc\u00eda. Su \u00e9xito radica en que la gente de los barrios m\u00e1s pobres compra mas en tienda que en supermercado, a \u00e9l le gusta la ubicaci\u00f3n de su negocio porque obtiene m\u00e1s utilidades. Cesar est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de $2.000.000 y lo invertir\u00e1 para ampliar el surtido de abarrotes en su negocio, por ejemplo los fr\u00edjoles, papas, granos, arroz y lentejas.\n\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1, su sue\u00f1o es montar un supermercado como las grandes cadenas y aspira que Dios le d\u00e9 la oportunidad mediante su trabajo. Usa las utilidades generadas por su negocio para cubrir los gastos de la seguridad  social de \u00e9l y su familia y para sostener a su familia dignamente. Cesar y su esposa saben que sus esfuerzos no son en vano, porque con su trabajo honrado est\u00e1n construyendo un mejor vivir para el futuro de ellos y de sus hijos.\n\n","en":"When visiting the shop of Cesar V\u00e1squez, one does not think of Antioquia, the district located in northwest Colombia that is isolated by the Cordillera Central (one of three main branches of the Andean mountain range).  The inhabitants of this area were forced to work hard to fend for themselves.  Anyone living in \u201cEl Paisa\u201d (which refers to the districts of Antioquia, Risaralda, Caldas, and Quind\u00edo located north of Cauca Valley and northwest of Tolima) had to find their own food from other parts of the country in order to survive.  Their own culture developed as a result of their drive, perseverance, and backbreaking work before finally settling in an area in the heart of the country.  When walking through the region of \u201cEl Paisa\u201d, one can see the forms of entertainment that resulted such as horse races, bull fights, dances, ring games, cards, dice, roulette, tightrope walking, cock fights, and fireworks.  For example, Tormenta, the name of the store owned by Cesar and his wife, is situated in an area of \u201cEl Paisa\u201d where the region finds its identity.  The store is located next to a horse riding club where the members and their families come to Cesar\u2019s establishment to have fun and buy food, refreshments, and other products any time of day or night.  Tormenta was named after a very special horse.  Photographs of this beautiful specimen decorate the walls to the delight of its admirers, which makes Cesar\u2019s store a perfect communal gathering place and an ideal place to visit for those coming from the neighboring region of Soledad Atl\u00e1ntico or from Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nCesar V\u00e1squez describes himself as a person prone to succeed and willing to take risks.  He is a 30 year old head of household and proprietor of his own store, located in the neighborhood of Centenario in the city of Soledad.  He and his wife work together, hand in hand.    Both of them are natives of Granada and C\u00e1ceres respectively.  They have two children, ages 13 and 4, who are the driving force for them to become working professionals and have all the necessary tools to live independently, be persistent, progress in life, and overcome any obstacles.\r\n\r\nCesar is a striking image of his father who, like any Paisan, was an excellent worker who made good use of his expertise.  He drove Cesar to study.  In return, Cesar was inclined to work hard from a young age.  He started working with his father in the fields, where he developed many of the skills he uses today.  Cesar manages his business every day with what appears to be almost a natural ability.  \r\n\r\nCesar is receiving his second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  When he started with the organization, it only had one location.  With this loan, he plans to purchase shelving and merchandise.  His success is attributed to serving the people from the poorest neighborhoods, who shop more at his store than at a supermarket.  He likes the location of his business because of its many advantages.  Cesar will use his loan of 2,000,000 COP to increase his inventory of groceries such as beans, potatoes, grain, rice, and lentils.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, his dream is to establish a large supermarket chain and aspires that God will give him such an opportunity in his work.  With the profits from his business, he is able to cover his expenses and pay for Social Security for himself and his family so that they can continue to have a decent lifestyle.  Cesar and his wife know that their efforts are not in vain because their honest labor will build a better life and future for themselves and their children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":478516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise & shelving","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"C\u00e9sar De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":144255},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":151427},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":154581},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157802},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161089},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":164445},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167871},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":171369},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":174939},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":178583},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":182304},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":191335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.22},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.28},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":8.17,"local_amount":15942,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":16029.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913414},{"amount":65.76,"local_amount":128313,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":129019.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949019},{"amount":156.83,"local_amount":306008,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":307693.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712184},{"amount":80.87,"local_amount":157802,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":158671.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895690},{"amount":82.56,"local_amount":161089,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":161976.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636013},{"amount":84.28,"local_amount":164445,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":165350.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850117},{"amount":86.03,"local_amount":167871,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":168795.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116886},{"amount":87.83,"local_amount":171369,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":172313.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410751},{"amount":181.18,"local_amount":353522,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":355469.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550410},{"amount":191.49,"local_amount":373639,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":375697.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427263}],"funded_date":"2010-02-01T22:42:11Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":176432,"name":"Ghassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ghassan is a 37 year old married man and father of 2 young children.

The most difficult part is fumigating his land.  He always runs the risk that the chemicals will cause some time of disease.  In time, he wants to rent new land to increase his production.\n\nThis is Percy\u2019s fourth loan with MFP.  He was very punctual with his previous payments, and he expects to be able to do the same now.  He is one of a few men in his communal bank.

As yet, few are aware of how many sources of enterprise and industry lie open to women in areas directly connected with the family estate. \r\n\r\nCholpon S., 37, is the leader of this group. She, like many other women in the country, was sure that there were very few employment opportunities for an uneducated women like her. The loan from Kiva helped her understand that she can invest needed funds in cattle breeding and qualify herself to superintend a dairy farm. Cholpon has small assets of cattle, but believes she is well trained for this business. She believes that the capital provided by Kiva lenders will be an investment that will become profitable with good management. She purchased some cattle two years ago for 3,000 soms because she knew it is the closest of all within reach for a woman with the proper abilities and training. She is also very interested in studying the care of domestic animals. She learned that cattle require great care especially when young, good food, warm and dry quarters, particularly in harsh wet winters. Cholpon is the mother of four children and satisfies their basic needs. Cholpon gathered and leads this group of like-minded fellows in order to request the loan for purchasing additional heads of livestock. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She needs to replace it with another brand new fishing boat. So Jocelyn requested a loan of PHP 7,000.00 to purchase a brand new fishing boat.\r\n\r\nJocelyn has been a member of GDMPC for one year. In  the future, Jocelyn prays that someday she will have 5 to 10 fishing boats to continue and improve their living and for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC: GDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nGDMPC people empowering people.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":793251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a brand new fishing boat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calamba Mis.

is mother of two young children who are still in their early stages of childhood. She lives with her husband who is dedicated to providing classes in a center for primary education. Due to a lack of budget to cover personal expenses, it occurred to Gusbinda to provide her neighbors with portable water from installing networks of tubes outside of her house.  Since the majority of the residences in her neighborhood lack this portable water, she decided to provide it. This activity has provided a significant income every month with which she can help her husband and improve the quality of life for her family. With the daily demand, she has plans to continue expanding her distribution network to provide faster and better service to each of her clients.

is 62 years old and married with 2 children and 7 grandchildren. He studied until 4th grade and then stopped due to his family\u2019s difficult financial situation. Originally from the Inhambane province in Mozambique, he moved in 1973 to Boane, 30km away from the capital city Maputo, to look for work and stayed thereafter. During the Mozambican civil war, Arnaldo\u2019s whole family moved from Inhambane to Maputo to stay with him, as it was safer to be closer to the capital. His oldest son also lives in Boane while the youngest lives in Namaacha, a village bordering Swaziland.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1985, Arnaldo built a barbershop while he soon expanded to incorporate a hair salon. The shop is strategically located in Boane\u2019s central market street, in the corner with the road that connects to Maputo, so it has always benefited from a good number of walk-in clients.  Arnaldo and 1 employee work at the barbershop and his daughter-in-law and another employee work at the hair salon. Arnaldo sees around 15 clients at the barbershop and 20 clients at the hair salon per week. A man\u2019s haircut is MTn 15 (approximately US$0.61). Arnaldo goes to Maputo every week to buy all the products necessary for his business, using public transportation. Arnaldo makes around MTn 1,500 per week.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Arnaldo\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku. The first loan he used to buy products for his businesses and also buy a television and an iron. This time Arnaldo plans to use the MTn 18,000 loan to buy products for his business, such as shampoos, conditioners, sprays and so on, as well as replace some materials that have become worn with use, such as hairdryers and scissors. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Arnaldo would like to ask for a new loan to repair his house and the

Thi Nguyen is 47 years old and has 3 children, one of which is still in school.  Before joining the Fund her family worked as manufacturing technicians, both she and her husband had strong professional experience.  However, due to a lack of capital to buy raw materials for manufacturing, the family\u2019s income was not very good.  In 2006, she joined the Fund and borrowed 300,000 VND in the first round of funding.  With this money, the family bought equipment and invested in the factory, resulting in an income of 3,000,000 VND per month.  Besides the income from the factory, her two grown children also work and help their parents.  Therefore, the family\u2019s finances are improving day by day.  In the coming round of funding, she is requesting 9,000,000 VND to invest in buying more iron and other raw materials for use in the manufacturing activities by the family.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb C\u1ea3nh  n\u0103m nay  47 tu\u1ed5i, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 3 con trong \u0111\u00f3 c\u00f3 1 con \u0111ang trong \u0111\u1ed9 tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

She has grown bananas, avocados, and coffee with her husband since they were married.  Last year they decided to increase the size of the coffee farm in the hopes of increasing their income, but they did not have good results because of the excessive rise in fertilizer prices.  She was only able to buy enough to fertilize their fruit trees.  This year the prices have come down, so her goal is to plant new coffee fields because the coffee market is very profitable at certain times.  Her fruit trees bring in the income that sustains the family, and they almost always earn the same price.  Despite the good and bad moments, Lucila is very pleased with her farm and she continues to look toward the future.  Even though it is 9 km from her village to where the communal bank holds its meetings, she is very punctual.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As well as breeding pigs, she sells vegetables in the local market. Her husband, Mr. Met Chor, is a coconut seller. Mrs. C. is asking for a loan to buy six more piglets and a cow for breeding.

Jecibel completed high school and is in relationship right now with Richard Domasig, a carpenter. They have been blessed with four children who are currently studying in elementary school. Together they live in Balubad, Silang, Cavite, Philippines.\r\n\r\nJecibel has been retailing rice to her neighbors for quite a few years now.  Basically, she buys sacks of rice at a wholesale price and retails them to her neighbors by the kilo with a minimum mark up.  Along with this, she also incorporates within her store the retailing of cell phone load credits to all mobile network users among her community. Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this to pay for additional sacks of rice and purchase more cell phone load credits for retailing.\r\n\r\nJecibel desires a successful business, a healthy body, and a peaceful and happy life. She also prays that she will be able to send all her children all the way through college.

four children. Because her family had no stable source of income, she went abroad to work as a domestic helper. She did this for eight years, then came home and opened a sari-sari (or variety) store where she makes most of her income by selling snack foods, breads and drinks. Imelda is determined to give her children the best possible life, and uses much of her income to send them to school. She hopes to be able to send them to college someday. To make this possible, she has also gone into business selling meat such as chicken and pork, as well as lipstick, lotion and fragrances.

She explains that she has a passion for travel, having been to every corner of her country. For this reason, Soraida has truly found her niche in clothing sales, which allows her to travel all over. Every single day she wakes up early and leaves her home by 8 am. She then spends the entire day or several days traveling to different sites, buying and selling clothing. She sells all types from the very traditional to the most modern and fashionable. The majority of Soraida\u2019s purchasing is done in either Cusco or the capital city of Lima, both of which are more than a 10 hour car trip outside of Ayacucho. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore she sold clothing, Soraida was living in Lima, selling vegetables from a stand in one of the busy markets. It was an extremely difficult way to make a living, she explains, so she decided to move back to her hometown of Ayacucho where she has been able to buy her own home and begin her small business in clothing sales. For the past 6 years, her business has been growing steadily and she currently has many regular clients who come to her for all of their clothing needs. Soraida asserts happily that she is doing what she loves, and is always looking for new and better ways to increase the amount of clients she serves. \r\n<p>\r\nA key element in Soriada\u2019s success has come from her involvement with her village bank. She says it has not only been a place to receive economic opportunities, but also it also serves as a distraction from the difficulties of life, as she has made many close friends. She also loves the lessons taught in her village bank regarding everything from business practices to self-esteem. Soraida is requesting a loan of $1000. With this money, she will pay for her transportation between Ayacucho and the rest of Per\u00fa, as well as the purchase of larger quantities of clothing to sell to larger quantities of clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":85006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To pay for transportation between Ayacucho and the rest of Per\u00fa, as well as the purchase of larger quantities of clothing to sell to larger quantities of clients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-05T04:00:51Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2997,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":749.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-01-05T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":109678},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-02-05T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128919},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-03-05T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":150052},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-04-05T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":749.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":174464}],"funded_date":"2007-11-21T04:00:51Z","paid_date":"2008-04-05T10:13:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28523,"name":"Metanet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Metanet is an Internally Displaced Person from Fizuli region located in the south-east part of Azerbaijan.

She has a baby apparel factory. Ever since she was young, Margarita has been in retail. Her first business was herbal remedy sales. She also assisted in delivering babies. She started a chicken farm as well, but because she had no experience in that line of work, things did not go well and all her chickens died. <p>\r\nShe kept working hard, and with the help of her husband, was able to purchase 3 cows, which will soon have their own young.  This is why she is very happy. She also notes that she did not have an opportunity to provide her children with an education, which is why they, along with their dad, went to work at a sweater factory four years ago. As a consequence, they started learning skills and obtaining experience, which is how the idea to purchase a knitting machine to make baby outfits was born. One of her children currently helps her manage the business, and he can now study. Her youngest son now attends school as well. She dreams of being able to build her own house and of seeing her children get an education so that they can be upright professionals. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":233787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies to make sweaters and baby apparel ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Tecp\u00e1n, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2008-12-09T08:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124,"local_amount":930,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":942.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14855552},{"amount":76,"local_amount":570,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":577.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20395042},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27086841},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35980410},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44441213},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63169010},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-20T08:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73594332},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87029803},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-20T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110796900},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123903637}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T15:46:26Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:54:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":81794,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Irene es comerciante se dedica a la venta D.  chicharr\u00f3n D. cuero  D. chancho seco, su esposo es empleado.\nSu domicilio se encuentra ubicado en la zona D.

Cruz has a business selling clothing for men, women and children.  She also markets skin care products and cosmetics.  Her business is located in a small commercial center which is located at the entrance of San Isidro.  This is a place that many people pass  through, as there is public transportation there, which benefits Cruz because her business is seen by all of these people.  Cruz also works as a street vendor selling clothing in various cantons in her area.  This assures her greater earnings, which is a great help to her family's economic welfare, as she and her husband are supporting their grandchildren.  For this reason she is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL, which she will use to invest in her business, buying more clothing and cosmetics, and stocking her business with other products such as shoes, underwear, and more.

She has 3 school-age children. Nenita is the group leader of a 12-member loan group administered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if one of them is delinquent or defaults on a loan. The official name of this borrowing group is Nenita L.'s Group. <p>\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, Nenita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector. More specifically, she runs a general store, so her primary source of income is derived from selling a variety of products to her fellow community members. Nenita has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nenita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services. In turn, she was able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve her standard of living. Nenita recently repaid a prior loan in the amount of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items in order to expand her product offering. Nenita is now seeking another loan, this time in the amount of 15,000 PHP (though the amount being sought for the entire group loan is 165,000 PHP, or $3,700), which will be used to expand her business. This loan would be the fifth loan taken out by Nenita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of the loan to pay the tuition fees of her children. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches, which cover the Central and Northeastern areas of the country.

Businessmen lost a significant portion of their customers. Since those events entrepreneurs are recovering slowly and going back to a normal life. \r\n \r\nAnipa J., 56, is a leader of this group. She is a widow and lives with her four-year-old grandson. Anipa\u2019s grandson goes to a daycare, and Anipa devotes the whole day to a business of cattle breeding. Two years ago her son recommended that she start this business, and since then she hasn\u2019t regretted doing so once. Anipa buys young calves, breeds them and resells them in a local market. She gathered a group with three other stock breeders and applied for a loan from Kiva through its partner Mol Bulak Finance. The proceeds from this investment will help her to improve living conditions for her grandson. Anipa also runs a dairy business and sells milk to a local market every morning. Her primary challenges were high costs for transportation and feeding the cattle, but despite those hardships Anipa believes she will overcome all challenges and expand her business. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is the oldest daughter in a family with five children. When she was growing up, her mother did not work outside of their home, but had a reputation in her community as an excellent cook. Diala remembers waking up early in the morning before school and bathing and grooming her younger sisters, all the while being drawn to the kitchen by the smell of the fresh falafel, beans and warm bread with hot tea that her mother would prepare for breakfast. Though her family survived on the small income that her father made as a spice peddler, Diala remembers how her mother kept their door open to her neighbors and friends, who knew they could always stop by for a warm welcome and a hot meal.\r\n\r\nDiala learned the art of food preparation from her mother, along with her commitment to share their food and homes with people in their community. Diala is also developing a home-based business where she makes pastries to sell. She is applying for a loan for 400 JOD to buy an automatic oven and equipment to start making pickles. Her goal is to increase her income and eventually open a pastry shop. She would also like to earn enough money to buy a house for her family.
