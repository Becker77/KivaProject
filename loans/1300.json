selected as the Kiva representative. Benjamin has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo, with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 32 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here, but they will be receiving an average loan of KES 5,349 (shillings).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBenjamin is 34 years old and has been a farmer for four years. Benjamin works as a farmer to provide for his three children. The community and other farmers know Benjamin as friendly, hard-working, and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups, such as the men's group. Benjamin described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBenjamin first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Benjamin joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and to earn enough money to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member. \r\n\r\nBenjamin plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, to save for the future, and to buy a pig. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Benjamin\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Benjamin and the Nasambu Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T16:50:06Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":171168,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171168}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":655065,"name":"Hoi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hoi is requesting a new loan to buy food and beverages to sell to her customers.

The family\u2019s main sources of income are from farming rice and working for others for a fee. She has been in this business for 10 years. Low crop yield is still a main challenge for her family\u2019s business. \r\nNoerm has been with VisionFund for three cycles and has completely paid back the loans, which has helped her relieve her family's burden and improve their livelihood. Now she is leading her group to ask for a loan. As the leader, Noerm is going to use her portion to pay for harvesting rice. She hopes this loan will enable her to earn more income to improve her living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1507663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for harvesting rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Moung Russey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-01-08T17:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T17:10:19Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noerm","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Orn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":100248.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490980344},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":100248.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517698879},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":801988.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542684278},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T11:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":601491.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581735623},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":601491.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595342914}],"funded_date":"2014-01-09T07:28:54Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T16:19:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":655077,"name":"Nisorei Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Running a family is such a big burden for Lhingneineng, who also takes care of her father-in-law, who is going through an intensive medical treatment. She is the profiled member for Nisorei Group and she is pictured with her hand raised. She and her husband work to generate income for the family.  Before the pharmacy business was started, she raised chickens and sold them in the village and the neighbouring villages.\r\n\r\nAll the group members reside in a village which is about 40 kms north of the Imphal capital in Manipur. They are all hard-working and determined to give the best to their family and kids.\r\n\r\nLhingneineng runs a drug store in the town market, about 40 kms from the town capital. She sells all first aid kits and other drugs. The absence of good hospitals and doctors gives her a good chance to sell drugs in the town. The hospital in town is far away and doctors in the town are unavailable most of the time when needed. The villagers first choice is to purchase drugs from Lhingneineng's drug store and treat the patient before they are brought to the town. Keeping this in mind, she purchases and sells drugs which are meant for common illnesses like cough, fever, diarrhea, etc. She usually gets the supplies from Imphal town and sells them with a little profit. The generated income is meager and is insufficient for the family expenses and kids' education.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more drugs and sell them. With the festive season in full swing, there are so many occasions for feasts, people tend to get diarrhea and have indigestion issues with the winter approaching. She wants to purchase drugs for the treatment of those problems and make more income. Her future plan is to extend her pharmacy and become one of the well-known drug sellers in the town. She also wants to give the best education to her kids and let them appear for the allied services. She says \u201cThank you so much, Kiva\u201d for the wonderful assistance and making her burden lighter. She wishes to continue the partnership and says \u201clet us all hope for the best\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in tailoring, weaving, vegetable selling, rice selling, piggery, a cosmetic store, and paan-dukan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1507669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more drugs for the pharmacy, generating more income and supporting the family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-08T17:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T17:10:19Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kipsohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimjahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dimlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chunjanei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Achin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengthem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoitin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ringkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemkhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neisojang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neijaneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalthangi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneihoiq","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":215000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":215000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-12T23:46:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":655097,"name":"Angelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelita raises her two children with a simple living.

is 28 years old and a married man who lives in the village of Sadguri Metekhi, Kaspi district. He has his wife, mother, sister and his grandmother, who gets monthly assistance from the local government. Merab's mother is a stylist and generates 400 GEL monthly. His sister is a sales lady and works for a low salary. Merab also is employed, working as an artisan in a vulcanization, but his income is hardly enough to pay all the daily costs for his family.\r\n\r\n A loan of 1000 GEL will be a huge support to this hard-working man and his family, enabling him to repair his own car and start up a taxi business. Merab will serve people from his district in his spare time and will increase his income. Merab sought for credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.

Su esposo, es agricultor.  De sus hijos 3 hijos, unicamente la menor vive con ella y estudia 5\u00ba  grado. \n\nDoris tiene 18 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la venta de ropa,  pero hace un a\u00f1o inicio en el negocio propio,  de venta de verduras y frutas. Ambos negocios los conoce muy bien, ya que cuando su padre muri\u00f3, fue su madre quien le ense\u00f1o a como poder trabajar en estos negocios, as\u00ed fue como aprendi\u00f3 las t\u00e9cnicas de comercializar los productos.

Her husband works in agriculture.  Of her three children, only the youngest daughter lives with them, she is in 5th grade.  Doris has worked selling clothing for the past 18 years, but a year ago she started her own business selling fruits and vegetables.  She knows both businesses well because after her father died, her mother taught her how to work in both fields, which is how she learned how to sell products.  \r\n\r\nThe places where she sells are 5 kilometers away.  She travels by bus; everyday she wakes up at 4:30am in order to prepare breakfast for her husband and daughters.  She then goes out to sell, and returns home at 3pm.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to build a wall around their home's property.  The loan will help Doris purchase the construction materials and pay for the labor.  The wall will provide them with better security and peace of mind as no one will have direct access to their home.  \r\n\r\nDoris has many dreams, one of which is to be able to leave her children with a place to live.  She would also like to have a small store in her home.  In addition, she would like to purchase a mill for her son so he can have his own business.  She will use the earnings from her business to pay off the loan and invest it back into the business, so she can always have an active source of employment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1459941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

His father raised him according to this principal - \"forty professions are not enough for one man.\"  This is how Ulmas is involved in various work and earns a living without choosing and dividing \"business\" into different categories.  He is also involved in animal husbandry.  He primarily breeds, fattens up and sells cattle and small livestock.  His parents and brothers live with him.  He plans to buy cattle and feed for them, but does not have a sufficient amount of money on hand.  Ulmas decided to come to MDO \"Arvand\" for a loan.

","en":"Maria Fernandina is the 2nd daughter of a family from Estrato 2. She graduated from a district school and began to study the technical career of business administration. But this lasted for just 1 semester, since she lacked sufficient economic resources. Maria then went to work in a call center in collections, seeking a means of saving money to pursue her goal of completing her education. \r\n\r\nShe performed this job for 2 months, then her health failed and 7 months passed without work. Then a brochure arrived at her house suggesting the option of technical studies in hotel administration and tourism at another institution. She enrolled and studied for 4 months, pursuing different subjects \u2013 protocol, etiquette, client services, table and bar service. She was very happy and enthusiastic and was drawn into the hotel world, desiring to learn all she could about this career.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as time passed, the economy didn't permit her to continue her studies. Life necessities required her to work in a grocery store in food preparation, without thought of continuing. After 2 years working for this company, Maria decided to continue her studies in hotel matters at Campo Alto, where local contacts recommended she attend.\r\n\r\nDespite an improved financial situation, paying school bills was still a bit complicated. But Maria desired to continue studying in order to advance professionally and personally. She wanted to understand the hotel world, becoming an excellent and exemplary manager of a 5 star hotel \u2013 even to create her own hotel chain \u2013 and she hopes that with Kiva's help, she can complete her studies at Campo Alto."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1507382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester's matriculation fees in hotel management.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-08T17:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T17:30:10Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Tourism"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Fernanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":145498.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392938},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":145498.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069619},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":145498.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882562},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:45Z","rounded_local_amount":145498.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201926},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":290996.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286067}],"funded_date":"2014-01-09T00:00:01Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":655252,"name":"Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ella es margarita, es madre de una ni\u00f1a, lleva en el programa de auxiliar de enfermer\u00eda 1 a\u00f1o, le ha sentido el gusto y cree que ha tomado la mejor decision con el programa que escogi\u00f3, desea terminar los estudios ya que quiere un buen futuro para ella y para su hija, le ha gustado la carrera porque cada vez se siente mas identificada con el, ya que desde que empez\u00f3 le llama la atenci\u00f3n todos los temas que ha visto, a de mas quiere seguir progresando en la carrera ya que espera que pueda ser una jefe de enfermera para a si poder seguir progresando por si le va bien en la carrera, quiere poder hacer en la universidad para poder ser doctora en pediatr\u00eda, desea el convenio con kiva ya que como es madre soltera y menor de edad aun no tiene una oportunidad laboral, porque vive con la mama y es vendedora y gana el salario m\u00ednimo, la mama es la que responde por ella y por la hija que tiene,a dem\u00e1s de todos los gastos que tiene la mama en la casa.\nLa verdad ella no quiere dejar el sue\u00f1o por el dinero, espera le puedan colaborar, ella agradecer\u00eda sinceramente ","en":"Meet Margarita.

Even though she is young, she has four daughters: Alie and Adele are nine, Nazik is three, and Aline is two. Aisuluu has a high school education and is a homemaker. She takes care of the household and raises the children. She is very diligent, responsible, kind and careful by nature. Aisuluu raises livestock and plants crops to provide the main source of income for her family. She began nine years ago when she bought cattle for 35,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Aisuluu now has four dairy cows, four horses, and four hectares of land for planting potatoes and grains every year. She has everything she needs to take care of the livestock. Her spouse actively helps on the farm and earns additional income providing shipping transportation services. Their monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). In order to develop her farm, Aisuluu asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy more cows. Aisuluu plans to use the profits to invest in more livestock and to save money to improve her family's welfare."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1487085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Chiy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":171.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisuluu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":135000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2578.42,"local_amount":135000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":135015.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":171.58,"payment_id":579488746}],"funded_date":"2013-12-11T04:31:10Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":655107,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia helps her husband work their farm to make a living.

Safania has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 96 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant one quarter acre of maize and one quarter acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nSafania is 74 years old and has been a farmer for 50. Safania works as a farmer to provide for his 10 children. The community and other farmers know Safania as friendly, hardworking, and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, and prayer group. Safania described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nSafania joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Safania joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer, hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed family.  Because he is an active community member, wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Safania has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Safania's life because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support. He also was able to save money and feed his family. In the future, Safania hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, buy a cow, and invest in a business.\r\n \r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

Sadly, her father died and she had to start helping her mother so that the family wouldn't lack the income to pay the household expenses. Now she is married and her husband is a farmer. They have 2 children who are 5 and 6 years old and will go to school this year.\r\nErlinda has been a farmer all her life since her father died. She began with her mother, growing corn and beans. Growing these grains meant that they never lacked for food at home. She got married 10 years ago and, together with her husband, sows 14,000 square meters of corn. The land is located a kilometer away from their house and they make the journey by bicycle to start work at 6:30 in the morning and finish at 11:30.\r\nThis loan will be used to buy a cow which they hope to breed every year in order to grow their number of animals. \r\nErlinda's lifelong dream has been to have a little herd of milk cows as this was her father's dream and, sadly, he could not achieve it. But she hopes to get there and to start a livestock business. She also wants to have a team of oxen so she can do farm work with animal traction. Another hope is that her children become good people and for this she needs to give them a good example and, most importantly, education.

He lives with his parents and other siblings in Stung Treng province. Recently, Rasmeymath just passed his high-school exams and got a grade B. He aims to continue his education in the faculty of business management at Build Bright University in Phnom Penh. He is interested in this major because he realizes that it\u2019s suitable for his personality.

She works at the business from 8:00 am until 5:30 pm, 6 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and proper business location.\r\n\r\nIsha requires a loan to purchase more fish for resale.

She is single and doesn't have any children.  She completed secondary school and graduated as a nurse thanks to her parents' financial and moral support.  Due to a lack of jobs in her community, she doesn't practice her profession and decided to switch to farming and business.  Her parents have a farm where they grow coffee and vegetables such as sweet peppers and tomatoes.  They have had the farm for many years and have learned to sell their crops as well.  Their customers include various grocery stores, vegetable vendors, and others.

He is pictured here in a group of six One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 77 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Wakhungu also joined One Acre Fund because he needs better harvest. Wakhungu has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving one-quarter acre of maize and one-quarter acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWakhungu is 44 years old and has been a farmer for 17 years. He works as a farmer to provide for his five children. Wakhungu\u2019s life has also improved because he has been a farmer with One Acre Fund. The community and other farmers know Wakhungu as a friendly and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group and savings group. Wakhungu described his harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund, but he hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nWakhungu joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Wakhungu joined One Acre Fund so that he could get new farming methods, earn enough to feed his family, and send his children to school. Because he wants to help more farmers, Wakhungu has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Wakhungu explains that for the few days he has been with One Acre Fund he feels that his life is improving. In the future, he hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school, repair the home, buy a cow, and invest in a business.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Wakhungu and the Jikaze Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is one additional group leader in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4775,"image":{"id":1486934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to have the opportunity to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":4775,"lender_count":135,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wakhungu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wamae","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Omar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baraza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simiyu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":411873,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411873}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4775,"local_amount":411873,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-30T10:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":413509.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722850}],"funded_date":"2014-02-02T23:55:01Z","paid_date":"2014-12-30T10:31:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":643437,"name":"Oliver","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oliver is 23 years old and lives in the town of Hoima in the region of Hoima in Uganda.

He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nRobert joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and he is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Robert joined One Acre Fund, so that he could get the best seed prices and get new farming methods. Because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers. Robert has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund, as a group leader and as a Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Robert's life because he has more farm training and he was able to save money and feed the family. In the future, Robert hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and to buy a cow.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nRobert and the Elwanda Group Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to obtain hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the harvesting of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":3400,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adlite","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":294195,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294195}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":643436,"name":"Rahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rahim is 23 years old.

representative.  Moses has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 99 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMoses is 48 years old, married, and has seven children. He has been a farmer for 30 years. The community and other farmers know Moses as friendly.  Moses described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\r\n\r\nMoses first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Moses joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  Moses plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Moses\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from his harvest.  \r\n\r\nMoses and the Alpha Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One C62 Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":6125,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felistus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wamachimbo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muleyi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sikuku","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukoya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":529551,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":6125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529551}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":643307,"name":"Merlin Noel","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Noel est une jeune homme de 34 ans commer\u00e7ant,fianc\u00e9 mais p\u00e8re de 02 enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s respectivement de 01 et 03 ans. ce dernier va d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.  il a ouvert un pr\u00eat \u00e0 porter qu'il g\u00e8re dans un quartier de la ville depuis 7 ans d\u00e9j\u00e0.

She works as a farmer to provide for her four children. The community and other farmers know Elizabeth as friendly, reliable and trustworthy. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community, such as with the prayer group.  Elizabeth described her harvest last year as being excellent, but she hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nElizabeth joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and she is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. She joined One Acre Fund, so that she could get the best seed prices and get new farming methods. Because she likes being a leader and an active community member, she wants to help more farmers. Elizabeth has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and as a Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Elizabeth's life because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, and she was able to save money and feed the family. In the future, Elizabeth hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, save for the future, and buy a cow. Elizabeth also joined One Acre Fund because she wants better harvests.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Elizabeth and the Imani Fmrs Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1486953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blasio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":326289,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326289}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3775,"local_amount":326289,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-30T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":326910.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722851}],"funded_date":"2013-12-20T15:34:11Z","paid_date":"2014-12-30T10:31:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":654869,"name":"Jorge Iv\u00e1n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jorge es un hombre trabajador y perseverante, ha sacado adelante a sus dos hijos gan\u00e1ndose la vida a pulso.

As the Kiva group representative, David is pictured on the right of the Mkilima Group with his hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid is 47 years oda reliable member of the community.  He is married with 8 children.  David is 47 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 7 years to support his family.  In addition to this, David is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, prayer group and burial committee.  He described his harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund.  He hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer he is able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers that have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season will be David\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He joined this year in order to get new farming methods, get the best seed prices, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  As an active member in his community, David also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  David plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his shildren to school, repair the home, save for the future, and buy a cow.  He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund because he has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  David and the Mkilima Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorothy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":213960,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213960}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":655211,"name":"Nazeeran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazeeran is a 52-year-old married woman and the mother of five children.

A few years ago, Caroline started her own business to support farmers and their employees in the flower and tea-growing region of the Rift Valley and Western Kenya, where she has improved the lives of thousands by providing access to sustainable energy products that are needed within local communities.\n\nCaroline\u2019s product line now includes solar energy solutions, as well as improved cook stoves, which she and her small team sell on farms, in factories, savings and credit cooperatives, and in open-air markets.  The team also conducts trainings and live demos for community members to see the positive aspects of solar when compared to traditional energy sources such as candles, kerosene, and disposable batteries.  With years of experience selling a variety of solar products and building a reputation in her community, Caroline began working with One Degree\u2019s team in Kenya in 2012 after hearing about BrightBox, a new solar energy kit that powers lights, phones, and radios.  During initial demos, customers would get excited when seeing BrightBox lights in action; Caroline acted quickly as an entrepreneur. \n\nSince April 2013, Caroline has already sold over 230 BrightBox kits to her customers.  She already has requests for many more, which she would like to provide before the holidays.  While happy with her initial success, Caroline has been selling to customers on a regular cash basis, while many others cannot afford to pay upfront.  These same customers are often stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging.\n\nTo break this cycle and provide renewable energy to these customers, Caroline would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those who need it most, while also increasing her inventory on hand to serve more customers.  She seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nCaroline will use funds for 170 units of Bright Boxes solar kits, which will energize and empower households across her region.  Customers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them upfront or over several months.  Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Caroline will help families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":14550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":14550,"image":{"id":1486781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers and farm employees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":14550,"lender_count":359,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":14550,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":14550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":14550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4624.28,"local_amount":4624.28,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-06T09:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4624.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459197696},{"amount":923.79,"local_amount":923.79,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-31T08:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":923.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468017225},{"amount":1972.02,"local_amount":1972.02,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-31T08:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1972.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240612},{"amount":3584.56,"local_amount":3584.56,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-02T09:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3584.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490936811},{"amount":3445.35,"local_amount":3445.35,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3445.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504374646}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T18:46:42Z","paid_date":"2014-08-02T10:06:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":643467,"name":"Mwikali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwikali is a married woman with nine children, all of whom attend school.

She is married, and they have three children. Gulchehra has a large family. In addition to her husband and three children, her mother, brother and sister-in-law also live with her. Gulchehra always wanted to have a large and friendly family, so her dream came true. However to provide for her family and children has become more complicated. \r\n\r\nFor around three years, Gulchehra has worked with selling fruit and vegetables, such as different types of apples, pears, pomegranates, grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers and many different vegetables. Her husband helps her with the work, but she mostly stands behind the counter alone.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 28 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for one-quarter acre of maize and one-quarter acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Everline is pictured on the right of the Madete Kaviri Group with her hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEverline is a reliable member of the community. She is married with seven children. Everline is 35 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 25 years to support her family. In addition to this, she is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group, prayer group, and burial committee. She described her harvest last year as not being with One Acre Fund. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoy the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEverline joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. She joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school. Because she likes being a leader, and she is an active community member, Everline wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Everline has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Everline's life because she has more farm training and more farm group support and was able to feed the family. In the future, Everline hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, and buy a goat.  \r\n\r\nEverline and the Madete Kaviri Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1487097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T21:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T21:50:09Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":149772,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149772}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1750,"local_amount":149772,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":151548.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722854}],"funded_date":"2014-01-05T02:43:41Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":643492,"name":"Cissy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cissy is married with two children who both attend school.

Mis\u00e9lida lives only with one daughter, 38-year-old Diana. Mis\u00e9lida  owns the house, having bought it after much effort and a lot of saving. Mis\u00e9lida  is an enterprising woman with a good head for business. She works at her different jobs according to the season. Of all her jobs, her main one is selling drinks of all types and brands. She buys in bulk to then sell the drinks to neighbours and passers-by. Mis\u00e9lida has a space in her house set up with chairs and tables, and a freezer. Mis\u00e9lida has been doing this work for five years.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mis\u00e9lida hopes to have a well-stocked bar where she can sell all day. She currently works only in the afternoon. Although Mis\u00e9lida has experience in this work, she still finds it difficult to serve all of her customers. Nonetheless she hopes that all of her efforts are fruitful - as they have been up to now - as all Mis\u00e9lida wants to do is prosper.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Mis\u00e9lida is applying for a loan of 1800 Nuevo Soles.

Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":643566,"name":"Macaria Angelica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Macaria is 42 years old and married with 4 daughters.  Her eldest is 18, her youngest is 12, and she has 14-year-old twins.  Her eldest daughter graduated from high school and her younger children are still enrolled in middle school.  Her husband is a craftsman and supports their family both economically and emotionally. They are a united family, which offers the perfect support for her business and their dreams of owning their own house.\n\nMacaria runs a bookstore in Jocotenango, close to Antigua, Guatemala.  She is an experienced business woman who was the owner of a clothing business in past years.  A while back she started looking for a new challenge and after analyzing the market in her neighborhood, she opened her new enterprise and received the support of two loans and personalized business education provided by Fundaci\u00f3n Namaste Guatemaya. \n\nShe wants to invest her loan money of 25,000 Guatemalan Quetzales in more stock for her bookstore, such as notebooks, markers, crayons, and construction paper, in order to serve the high demand from schools and universities in her neighborhood.  When she started her first loan cycle, she had a storefront and worked 183 hours per month.  She had an estimated monthly profit of 563 Quetzales, or approximately $70 US.  By the end of the first loan cycle, she increased her profits by 111% to approximately $150 US.  Macaria is now aiming towards a monthly profit of around $1300 US by the end of this upcoming loan cycle in 30 months. \n\nHer ideas regarding new strategies in order to achieve her goals include setting up a proper sign outside her bookstore and improving her publicity.  She is also considering the possibility of buying or renting a photo copy machine.  It is the size and scope of what she is trying to do that make her an exceptional candidate for the advanced training and larger loan size of the Namaste STARZ program.\n\nThe STARZ program is unique in the world of microfinance as the loan repayments are tied to the profits of the borrower instead of being fixed payments.  Since loan payments are linked to profits, borrowers are able to ride out business cycles or other unforeseen events.  Through the STARZ program, high potential women receive intensive business coaching bi-weekly over two to three years.  They also receive a formal six-month education in financial literacy and business operations that leads to a diploma in Small and Medium Enterprise Management by the Guatemalan Technical Institute for Training and Productivity (INTECAP).

Her daughter is a lawyer, her oldest son is an engineer, and her youngest son is currently studying in University and helps her with her business.  She graduated from 6th Grade Primary School before she started working.  Herminia is a professional seamstress that has been successfully managing her small business in Ciudad Vieja in the Sacatep\u00e9quez region of Guatemala.  Her top-selling items are dresses for the first communion and for \u2018Quincea\u00f1eras\u00b4 (a traditional 15th birthday celebration).  She is a very hard-working and dedicated woman, who managed to raise her children and grow her business by herself.  Her dream is to travel to the United States of America to explore a different world.\n\nHerminia wants to invest her loan money in two new sewing machines, fabric, accessories, and mannequins.  She is very innovative when it comes to new strategies, and wants to explore new markets and products, such as special covers for chairs.  She also wants to hire two full-time employees and open her store in a different setting in order to have more space.  It is the size and scope of what she is trying to do that make her an exceptional candidate for the advanced training and larger loan sizes of the Namaste STARZ program.\n\nThe STARZ program is unique in the world of microfinance as the loan repayments are tied to the profits of the borrower instead of being fixed payments.  Since loan payments are linked to profits, borrowers are able to ride out business cycles or other unforeseen events.  Through the STARZ program, high potential women receive intensive business coaching bi-weekly over two to three years.  They also receive a formal six-month education in financial literacy and business operations that leads to a diploma in Small and Medium Enterprise Management by the Guatemalan Technical Institute for Training and Productivity (INTECAP).  Credit is not generally available to women with businesses of this size, so an important program element is an appropriately-sized business loan.  Women also receive coaching in leadership, economic and gender empowerment, and renegotiating household power relationships.  By working with Fundaci\u00f3n Namaste Guatemaya, the STARZ participant and her business advisor have a continuous-loop, real-time monitoring, evaluation and learning system.  \n\nBy the end of Herminia\u2019s first loan cycle with Fundaci\u00f3n Namaste Guatemaya, she had increased her profits by 120% to around $540 US per month.  Her goal in the STARZ Program is to increase her monthly profits to approximately $970 US in the next year.  To do this, she has requested this loan of 30,000 Guatemalan Quetzales, with repayments over 36 months.

She grows vegetables and raises chickens and pigs to generate extra income. Her main source of income is weaving. She weaves all traditional shawls and wrap around skirts and sells them in the village and nearby villages. Although weaving is her main activity for generating income, she cannot not afford to purchase a loom and expand her business. She is the sole breadwinner in the family and all the family burden is on her. This leaves only a small sum to invest in her weaving business.  She still weaves with the help of the traditional backstrap and it takes more time to finish.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of the Kiva loan, she will purchase threads, yarns and other advanced tools for weaving. She is planning to generate more income, save money and purchase a loom. She says that with age, weaving with the help of the backstrap will be difficult and may cause health issues. She says, \u201cThank you Kiva\u201d and she also says that she will always remain obliged for what they have done for her and the group.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members are engaged in a piggery, weaving, a variety store, and a paan-corner.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1507798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase threads, yarns, other tools for weaving ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-09T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phakholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhunneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoineikim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-10T06:45:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":636574,"name":"Luis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luis moved from Ecuador to the United States without his parents when he was just five years old.

food industry, ranging from roles in management to product development, began with a little restaurant called the Heritage Internet Caf\u00e9 that he co-owned with his father back in 2006. Later, Chef D managed a national restaurant chain, and was promoted to product development, leading the execution of three of the corporation\u2019s popular menu concepts.\n\n\nIn January 2011, after years of working in the corporate world and learning the ins and outs of the industry, Chef D decided he wanted to return to running his own business. In May of that year, Chef D opened \u201cIt\u2019s a Wrap Caf\u00e9\u201d, an innovative establishment offering healthy and affordable fare in his hometown of Plainfield, New Jersey.\n\n\nNow, Chef D\u2019s catering business spans the New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey states. The first volume of his autobiography, aptly titled \u201cJack of All Trades: Mastered by One,\u201d hits stores soon\u2014as does an episode on Food Network featuring his restaurant and it\u2019s noble work in the community during the devastation of Hurricane Sandy last year.\n\n\nAs many who meet him will attest, Chef D is passionate about what he does, and what he does is provide value for his customers. He cares about people, and that is what sets It\u2019s a Wrap and his other ventures apart from the competition.\n\n\nA graduate of Johnson and Wales University, Chef D is passionate and dynamic\u2014the perfect personality for a business owner. He credits his childhood, when he would frequent banquet halls, as his inspiration for pursuing this career path. And that path involves big dreams.\n\n\nLooking forward, Chef D\u2019s goals involve expanding the catering and retail side of the restaurant, and opening new storefront locations. A repeat borrower in good standing with the Intersect Fund, Chef D needs working capital to help to complete rebranding efforts and allow further expansion of the business. The funds from this loan will go toward creating a new logo for the company and renovating the current storefront location.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5020.66,"image":{"id":1479746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Bharati gives much inspiration to her children for their education.\r\n\r\nHer son Kamalesh is studying in class X (grade 10). He is very studious and diligent in his studies. However, because of the financial crisis she and her husband are facing, she cannot pay for her son\u2019s upcoming tuition fees. The income totally depends on her husband\u2019s cycle van shop, which is at present not running smoothly. For this reason, Bharati has applied for this loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to pay the education costs, school fees etc for her son\u2019s studies, so that he is no longer excluded from his classes throughout the academicals year. She dreams of her son\u2019s higher education as much as possible to make him fit for contributing to her family.\r\n\r\nShe thanks BJS and Kiva for their new innovative product dedicated to rural poor children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1507819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"To pay tuition and other educational expenses for.her son","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-01-09T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bharati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-09T04:51:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":643623,"name":"Mbeyu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mbeyu appreciates her previous loan, which improved her living standards.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan enabled her to expand her business and earn a higher income.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a loan of KES 20,000 to buy more bales of clothes for her business.

Unfortunately, she was raised by only her mother who could not support her to continue her studies. So, she only studied until the 5th grade. She has been married for 35 years. Her husband is a farmer and they have a 29 year old daughter.\r\nWhen she was 12 years old, she began working alongside her mother who sold fruits and vegetables. She accompanied her everyday to help her with the sales. Later, her mother started a business making tortillas. This is how Reyna, a woman dedicated to work, had the first impulse to want to excel and achieve her goals. Today, she continues the business that her mother started and that she considers her greatest inheritance to be the desire to be hardworking and want to get ahead. Along with her daughter, she works in the tortilla business and they begin cooking the corn at 5 in the morning so that they can later go to the mill to grind the corn and have the meal ready to begin making tortillas.\r\nThe loan will be used to finish repairing her house, which was damaged during the earthquakes that happen in the country. Her business savings aren't enough to build the house. This is why Reyna needs the loan to finish repairing her house.\r\nWith the help that she is offered, she is working towards fulfilling one of her dreams, which is to repair her house. She also wants to have a tortilla business in the local market and to offer employment to other women who need to work, which would help them grow the business at the same time. She would have more income to pay off the loan and savings to build a perimeter wall on her land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1507857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to finish repairing her home which was damaged in the earthquakes that happen in her country.

and the other one is still small.  He has been running a general store since 2006.  He works from 7am to 9pm daily and is able to make a small monthly profit.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Alexander's 10th loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.  He used the previous loans to stock fast moving items, and has paid back all his loans successfully.  He is a hard working fellow and it shows.  He is grateful to all who have supported his group, Prado, with a loan.

Their son is a mason. They have a semi-pacca house (brick-built walls, but straw roof).\r\n\r\nSohiron's husband grows different vegetables (beans, chilies, cauliflower, cabbages) in different seasons. He sells them in the local market and earns money to run the family. It's already more than ten years that he has been extensively in this agribusiness. He works hard to be able to earn a living for the family. But his income is too low to run a family well, when prices of essential commodities are going high. So, they thought to start cultivation of potatoes.\r\n\r\nSohiron heard that BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) provides loans to rural women to start businesses, so she has taken a loan to buy potato seeds and fertilizers to start potato cultivation and sell the potatoes to the local market. She hopes to earn enough profit from this business since it is a profitable business in their area and is in great demand.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to overcome the financial hurdles of her family with the profit, and for the growth of her agribusiness to secure their future.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1487199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase potato seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation of potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T02:30:06Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sohiron ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T20:51:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":654707,"name":"Yusuf","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"  \u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444\u0443 50 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0414\u0436.\u0420\u0443\u043c\u0438. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u044b\u043d. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442 \u042d\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0448. \u0415\u043c\u0443 22 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c, \u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u043c. \u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441. \u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442.\n","en":"Yusuf is 50 years old.

Due to the lack of financial support from her parents she couldn't complete her primary school studies. <br \/><br \/>She works in agriculture growing coffee. For more than 11 years she has been involved in this activity along with her partner. He taught her to work the land. Their crops and house are on the same land, so she was interested to watch her husband carry out the process until the harvest of each year.  Her clients are neighbors, family, friends and middlemen who live in the area or arrive to purchase a product that is considered to be of high quality. One challenge for the small farmer is the rise in prices of supplies that they use to assist their crops plus the costs to transport the supplies to her house. <br \/><br \/>At present she is requesting a loan to buy the agricultural supplies needs to assist and maintain her coffee crops. Her goals are to finish a cement structure to dry and clean the grains once harvested. She dreams of forming a coffee producers cooperative in the area to commercialize the coffee beans in other parts of the world so they can enjoy their quality."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1488792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies to assist her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5.04,"local_amount":100.84,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":103.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895469},{"amount":0.95,"local_amount":19.09,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":19.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479118239},{"amount":494.01,"local_amount":9879.9,"processed_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10131.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595663590}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T20:29:32Z","paid_date":"2015-01-19T10:32:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":655424,"name":"Amalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Amalia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a coffin-making business in the Philippines, and earns additional income raising pigs.

Their oldest boy is married and lives independently, their second son is in high school, and the three younger children study in a small village school. The youngest stays at home as he is still very little. Her husband works as a bricklayer and they own their own home.\r\n\r\nRosa works primarily in the field, a family tradition, and this lets her support the household economy while at the same time being at home and caring for the family. She works the land and raises animals. The money from her previous loan was invested in the purchase of animals, seeds, and feed. She is cycling the loan to buy pigs, chickens, and animal feeds so she can continue to grow in this line of work and improve her household's income. She likes her loan team because at each meeting, she is able to chat with her friends about various things and build the bond among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1508056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy pigs, chickens, and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nab\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-01-09T03:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T03:50:05Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmita Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayda Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabian Vinicio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Encarnaci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3837.14,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":319.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":319.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":639.52,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":641.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636590},{"amount":641.67,"local_amount":639.52,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":641.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102948},{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":639.52,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":641.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467917826},{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":639.52,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":641.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138644},{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":959.28,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":962.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832584},{"amount":320.85,"local_amount":319.78,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":320.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258682}],"funded_date":"2014-01-13T18:29:48Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":655420,"name":"Maria Luz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As the married mother of four children, Maria Luz works hard to support her family.

She says the work pays poorly, but she doesn't currently have the luxury of not working. Employment in the country is a difficult situation. So as another source of income, she also makes and sews clothing. Her neighbors need the service, and she takes advantage of the opportunity by using the sewing lessons she learned from her mother. She works as an employee from Monday to Friday, and on weekends she does the sewing jobs she's gotten.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from CREDICAMPO is to buy a new sewing machine and some new material for sewing. The machine she has is old-fashioned and causes errors. This makes her job even harder as she only has the weekends to work at her business. She needs better working conditions to cover the jobs she gets and earn the income she needs for her family.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to own her own sewing shop that would let her meet the basic needs of
