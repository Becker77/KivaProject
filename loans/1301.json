He and his family live in a rural part of Tajikistan.  In order to have a continual source of income for his family, Salohiddin has to work very hard.  He sows crops such as onions & potatoes (among others) for a living.  This line of work pays well, but is seasonal, and can be quite finicky; for example, if the soil isn't fertilized in time, the harvest could be ruined.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Salohiddin needs fertilizer himself.  He's specifically in need of mineral fertilizers, but lacks the money to buy them.  That being the case, he's turned to Arvand in hopes of a loan to buy these fertilizers, and would like to thank them in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1498571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-01-09T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T05:10:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salohiddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":654},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":667.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":678.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":654},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":667.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":678.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":655448,"name":"Angelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelita is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a general store business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing 12,000 PHP through NWTF to purchase additional items to sell like canned goods, soft drinks, chips, bread, etc for her general store business.\r\n\r\nAngelita has been in this business for five years.

years old and a resident of the A. Jomi district of Tajikistan.  He has worked very hard his whole life.  He is a simple Tajik who works tirelessly to provide for his family.  He has gone through a lot during the course of his life. However, although he is already 60, he is still setting some new goals for himself, and he hopes to be able to achieve them. \r\n\r\nRazikul's new objective is to get involved in animal husbandry.  Having had a cow at home for domestic use for many years, he knows everything there is to know about livestock and raising cattle.  He hopes to find success in this new enterprise.  He is taking a loan to launch a new business and to start buying and selling cattle.  \r\n\r\nRazikul's plan is to have his own business, so that he can independently provide for his family and for himself in his late years.  With this goal in mind, he has requested a loan and he is hoping to receive your help.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1487068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a few head of cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"A.

Because Crupskaya's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education, her parents never had the chance to increase their earning potential.

4 kids together with her husband.  Her kids work at a local market, while her husband helps her tend the family farm.  They all live together as one big, happy family.  Everyone contributes as they can toward the family's well-being.  Character-wise, Rakhimajan is very hardworking and a caring mother to her children. She has the equivalent of a high school education, and raises livestock for a living, first starting 14 years ago with 6,000 som worth of animals. Thanks to her persistent efforts, Rakhimajan currently has a calf on her farm, and her monthly income is nearly 15,000 som. To further develop her farm, Rakhimajan is seeking a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners to buy some cows, fatten them, and sell them for a profit at a local market. She plans on using any extra money that the loan will allow her to make to continue to buy more livestock for her farm, as well as to make some home repairs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1487146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

As soon as she heard that BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) offers loans to rural and needy women, she has decided to take a loan of 15,000 INR to buy more potato seeds for farming potatoes in huge amounts to earn more profit. She thinks her contribution should improve her family\u2019s economic condition.

To do this she sells all kinds of clothing and costume jewelry on a door to door basis.  She also sells from home when customers are in need of something.  She goes out to sell three times a week and does her transactions on a credit basis, collecting payment every 15 days.  For nine years she has been in business and it has allowed her to cover her children's education costs.  Sometimes she buys the food when her husband is out of work.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy costume jewelry, pants, blouses, t-shirts and children's clothing which is what she sells most of during this time of year.  She has been in the communal bank for five loan cycles and enjoys it because she is able to get ahead with the loans.

Her challenges are insufficient funds and livestock diseases.\r\n\r\nDorca chose Juhudi Kilimo because they offer low interest rates for their loans.

from the due date. This was due to the inexpensive price of piglets today. Most of the group members keep sows and sell piglets. Because they are selling the piglets at the same time, the price of piglets goes down.\r\n\r\nNi Luh, as head of the group, feels the same thing. Luckily, she has an additional business as a farmer so that she does not lack everyday items. Ni Luh and all members of Sari Rasa group agreed to continue borrowing but changed the method of raising pigs to increase the selling price.\r\n\r\nSari Rasa group have resumed their lending from MUK. To increase the price of piglets, they changed the method of raising their pigs. Some members still keep sows and the other members keep super quality pigs for fattening or local pigs for pork roll. With this method, the sales of pigs will remain in this second group only. The members who have sows, will sell their piglets to the other members who raise pigs and fatten them for pork roll. The members who fatten pigs for pork roll will sell their pigs to the big buyers. \r\n\r\nNi Luh, as the head of the group, wasn\u2019t able to attend the meeting because of illness.

He then put money aside in order to open his own workshop. At a later date, he came up with the idea of developing a fabric shop. He is asking for a loan in order to purchase materials to furnish the fabric shop: poplin, string, lining, buttons, zippers. When he has fabric to sew, he will no longer be obliged to go to the market, and can be furnished onsite by his own fabric shop.

From the training offered by Juhudi Kilimo, Martha learned how to develop a culture of saving and investing.

She is married and is the mother of three children who live under her roof.  They are school-aged, in the community school.  She didn\u2019t have the opportunity to finish elementary school, and so she only finished second grade. This was due to a lack of economic support from her parents, because of their scarce economic resources.  For ten years, she has worked in the business of coffee farming, learning it from her parents as the family business.  It was the means of income for her family in her childhood, and she is still doing it today.  Besides growing coffee, she also works growing corn and beans on a plot of land she got thanks to a purchase her husband made a few years ago.  At the end of the harvest, she sells the corn and beans to local and intermediary buyers in the community, as well as neighbors and friends who also buy her produce in the area where she lives.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mayra has a goal of improving her home because it needs some repairs such as plastering the walls, replacing some adobe walls with brick, which is more secure, and the floor.  Her dream is to be able to have a great coffee plant nursery, to be able to sell in her area, to keep supporting her children in their studies until they can become professionals.  Because of this, today she is asking for a loan with which she will give better care and maintenance to her coffee plants, because the season is coming and she wants an excellent harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1488876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase farming supplies to help her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T15:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T15:10:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10254.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595663592}],"funded_date":"2013-12-10T17:21:02Z","paid_date":"2015-01-19T10:32:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":643778,"name":"Jamal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamal is a 27-year-old who lives in Taiz, Yemen.

Her difficult times are when she experiences drought seasons because there is not enough produce on her farm.\r\n\r\nVeronica chose Juhudi Kilimo because she has seen other farmers benefit from it. She appreciates the fact that they process their loans in the shortest time possible. During the training offered by the loan officers, she learned how to develop a lifestyle of savings. This loan will enable her to venture into sheep farming and this will bring in more income so that she and her large family will have better lives.

Her husband is a blacksmith. He manufactures iron accessories such as doors and windows which are usable in houses. He has also been providing door-to-door services to weld broken iron accessories. A few days ago, his welding plant became out of order due to overheating and needs to be replaced with a new one. He wants to buy a new welding plant, but does not have enough cash in hand due to excess household expenses. Therefore, Naseem requested a loan from BRAC Pakistan, who is an active field partner of Kiva, so her husband will be able to buy a welding plant to continue manufacturing.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1508315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a welding plant to weld iron accessories.

He has a mother and a married brother as his family. His mother and sister-in-law are housekeepers and take care of a child. Aivaz's brother is working at a fast food business and generates 500-600 GEL monthly. This is the only source of the family's income and they find it hard to pay for all the family's daily costs. Because of this, Aivaz decided to start his own activity and requested a loan. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Aivaz applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved as part of a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  A loan of $1500 will help Aivaz to purchase a secondhand car. He will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them inter-city.

She looks forward to this new loan with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nMaria dreams of having her own factory so she can make her own products and better support her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from her religion.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Gulbonu is a married, 51 year-old woman.  She lives with her husband and two sons in the city of Dushanbe.  Her oldest daughter is married and lives near them.  Gulbonu is a seamstress and earns a living with this trade.  She primarily sews women's national dresses.  She opened her own sewing business not long ago.  It will soon be two years since she has gotten involved in sewing.  Both of Gulbonu's sons are students.  Her youngest, 21 year-old son, Rabani, is studying economics at the Russian-Tajik Slavic University.  In the future, he wants to become a good specialist.

Ramaz always has high quality products and has his own constant clients. He has also cultivated mandarin and sells it seasonally. \r\n\r\nRamaz is really hard-working man with great desire to improve his family's living conditions and make a better future for his daughter. He has not amassed enough money to start another stable activity, so he requested a loan from MFO Credo, with the startup program that enables people to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nA loan of $3000 will help him to purchase a second-hand car and start a taxi business.

She started to make wedding and baby candies (candies that are given at wedding ceremonies and when a baby is born) by herself. She showed her work to a couple of companies and they liked it. Later, a company asked her to work with them. The company would give her a list of orders, she would make the candies and then she would deliver them to the company. Working this way was good for her. She could spend time with her family and do the housework. She worked with this company for a long time. The company paid her half the amount for her labor on her last order, so she got sad and angry. That day, she delivered the orders and she decided to do this work on her own while she was on her way home.\r\n\r\n As soon as she got home, she told her husband: \"Take me to Istanbul. I will buy materials and do this work by myself.\" Her husband was shocked and thought she was saying these things because she was angry. But Nigar had made a decision. She insisted, and they went to Istanbul that day. They bought the necessary materials and started to work immediately. She does not have difficulty selling the products because her network is very good. She has been working for five years and earning money this way. She is going to buy varieties of baubles, tulle, lavender, ribbons and chains with the loan. She has two orders for baby candies, and she is going to deliver them. She aims to open her own shop, even if it will be small, hire two employees and teach her job to them. One of her children finished university and got married. She wants her younger child to go to university, and she wants to support him. She hopes to grow her business and keep going forward.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n\r\nNigar Han\u0131m evli ve 2 \u00e7ocuk annesi.

This is her first loan cycle with the institution. Edith is going to use this loan to buy raw material (fabric and sticks) for her business. Her reason for requesting this loan is the strong demand for her products for carnival festivities. Before, they used feathers from birds in danger of extinction, and since they prohibited it, she began to preserve nature by making synthetic feathers. For this reason she has a lot of demand. Edith faces challenges in her business, one of which is a lack of cash to satisfy the demand, and she is going to use the profits to expand the business and buy machines, since right now she does it manually.

Josphat has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. He also joined One Acre Fund because he wanted better harvests. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 64 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. <br \/><br \/>Josphat is a reliable member of the community. He is married with five children. He is 38 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 16 years to support his family. In addition to this, Josphat is very active in his community and is involved in the savings group. He described his harvest last year as not being with One Acre Fund. He hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer he will be able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers who have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program! <br \/><br \/>The 2013 Long Rains season will be Josphat\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He joined this year in order to get new farming methods. As an active member in his community, Josphat also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  Josphat plans on using future profits from the harvest to save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business. He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund. <br \/><br \/>One Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Josphat and the Amani Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives. <br \/><br \/>The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase better harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":3975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josphat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wanjala","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Namukuchu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wangila","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nambale","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":342336,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":643848,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is 33 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by fattening pigs in the Philippines.

Juliet believes in herself, keeps her faith and is very hard-working.\r\n\r\nJuliet runs a boutique in the town market. She sells mostly women's garments like skirts, blouses, tops, tunics, boot cut pants, undergarments, etc. She usually gets the supplies from neighbouring states or places an order from the capital state of India, i.e., Delhi. Her customers prefer to purchase garments from her as they are imported garments and not locally manufactured. She usually fails to meet the demand of her customers due to insufficient cash to purchase more high quality garments. The shop is located in the middle of the town market which gives an advantage for selling. Sales increase during festive seasons and they are slow during harvesting season. Juliet always places an order for supplies before the festive season kicks off to let the customers gets the best items without letting them go to the main market in Imphal. \r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva loan, she will purchase more stock and cosmetics like sunscreen lotions, facial wash, day cream, talcum powder, etc. She aspires to become one of the successful businesswoman in the neighbourhodd and strongly believes in her dreams.

She takes care of and lives with her three daughters since her husband passed away. She is the sole income earner for the family.\r\n\r\nIbetombi used to make handmade mattresses. Since she could not afford to buy yarn, her customer paid for the yarn and she got only the making charges. It was very difficult to sustain the family with just a meager amount of income. Therefore, to access this loan she joined the group. With her first loan back in 2010 she bought yarn and started weaving traditional women's wrap-around skirts. She weaves and sells the products in the market town. She taught her daughters to weave as well and now they are also engaged in full-time weaving activities. \r\n\r\nFrom her second loan onwards, she was able to put aside savings from her earnings. She is very happy that she is doing well for the family and managing to cover the family's necessary expenditures. Now she has requested another loan to increase her inventory to sell. She wishes to weave the most desired and expensive wrap-around skirts with the third loan.

Nakeshi is one of them. The lady standing in the middle of the photo with her hand raised is Nakeshi. She is an energetic lady of 44 years who lives with her husband, one son and a daughter in-law. \r\nNakeshi has been running a paddy-milling unit in her village for the last 10 years. Apart from that, she is also cultivating vegetables and selling them in the daily market in the nearest town. Her husband and son are helping her in these businesses. She earns a daily net income of 300 INR from these businesses. Out of this income, she has been able to manage her household expenses in a decent manner. So Nakeshi is planning to increase her income by expanding the business. Looking into the demand of the locality, with the present loan, she wants to purchase a wheat roller milling machine. She is certain that this will generate a handsome income for her. With a portion of the loan, she also wants to purchase seeds and fertilizer for her vegetable cultivation. Nakeshi hopes to save enough money to build a permanent house for her paddy and wheat roller unit.\r\n\r\nThe four other members of the group are Tapaswini, Sarojini, Basanti and Sabitri who are

He has extensive experience in raising chickens and livestock as well as dairy production. Sohib's large family lives on a farm in the countryside and their main source of income are their animals. Sohib's wife and children help manage the family farm and produce dairy products. Sohib has four children and in order to provide for their nutrition, clothing and education, as well as help his aging parents, Sohib must increase his monthly profits. To increase his profits Sohib has to expand his herd and prepare them for the winter by stocking up on feed. In order to achieve these goals Sohib has turned to \"Arvand\" for a loan, which will make his goal a reality. Sohib's family are all very grateful to microfinance bank \"Arvand\" for the

Her family's main source on income is livestock and Malika's daughters-in-law help her with the animals. Unfortunately, livestock and dairy sales are not enough to provide for a large family, so all the men are now migrant workers in Russia, making money for everyone back home. Malika wishes she could help her family more, as the family is growing and the house needs to be expanded. In the face of winter the family also needs to stock up on fuel to warm the house. Malika would like to take out a loan to expand the house and has turned to \"Arvand\" for a loan. She plans to use the loan to buy building materials.\r\n\r\nMalika has been working with Arvand for three years and has a good credit history. She is happy with the loan conditions and is grateful that there is an organization which is ready to provide help for people in

Arman has been providing renovation services to locals for the past four years. Over these years of hard work, Arman has gained a good reputation among locals who value the high quality work that Arman does. The tools with which Arman works are too old, and Arman needs to replace them with new ones. Therefore, he has decided to apply for this loan to be able to purchase new tools needed to provide renovation services. Arman has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. The loan will be a huge help for Arman, and he hopes for lenders' support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1453.72,"image":{"id":1508479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

He has been driving by day and by night. This is the reason the rickshaw has experienced serious depreciation, due to his continuous driving.\r\n \r\nDue to a lack of cash in hand, Asia requested a loan. With the loan funds, her husband will buy spare parts for the vehicle, such as headlights, bolts, tyres, tubes, and the like.\r\n \r\nNow her husband feels tranquil and comfortable, because he has assurance of a regular income and more free time.

is a farmer who lives in Kisii, an area known for banana- and sugarcane-growing. He has practiced farming for four years, producing and selling milk, eggs, and bananas. He enjoys farming so much, because he gives his dairy cows the right treatment so they will produce more milk.\r\n\r\nJackson chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, because they will help him purchase a dairy cow that will produce more milk for him, and the interest rate on their loans is affordable for small-scale farmers. During the training he received from Juhudi Kilimo, he learned how to develop a savings culture.

Throughout the 20 years he has worked independently, he has been able to generate the necessary income to financially support his children.  <br \/><br \/>Benjam\u00edn dreams of having his own business at a commercial center where he can offer more products.  He fully intends to keep striving in order to fulfill that dream.  Having a loan will help to achieve that goal.  The money will be used to buy inventory in bulk such as fruits, pastries, and sweets.  This will enable him to diversify the products he offers and gradually expand his market.  As a result, his sales and income will improve.  He hopes to be able to provide better living conditions and improved well-being for his loved ones.  <br \/><br \/>In the future, Benjam\u00edn hopes to have the opportunity to enjoy a peaceful retirement with no financial worries."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1507320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
