She is educated, she doesn't have kids, and she lives with her common law husband.  Eva and her husband are both middle school teachers currently teaching at a school in their community.  She is a visionary and enterprising woman, which is why for the past five years she and her husband have been growing coffee.  They started with a piece of land which her husband inherited from his parents, and have put a lot of work and dedication into growing coffee.  When the school day is over they go out to the country where they work their land together.  It was Eva's husband who taught her how to farm.  Her goals and plans have gradually been coming to fruition since she is very optimistic and hardworking.  A goal she has is to buy a pickup truck with which to transport the harvested coffee beans to the place where they will be sold, as well as the inputs she needs to keep her coffee plants healthy and strong, with excellent foliage and good-sized coffee beans.  Her goal is to be able to install a cement patio where she can dry and clean the coffee before selling it.  Today she is requesting a loan from COMIXMUL cooperative with which to buy the inputs she needs to tend her coffee fields, as well as to pay laborers to harvest the coffee beans so they don't dry out or rot on the branch."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":713.5,"image":{"id":1488907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy inputs and pay laborers to harvest coffee beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":713.5,"local_amount":14520.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-28T10:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":14633.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595663771}],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T18:43:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kimberly Scott","image":null}},{"id":643904,"name":"Alicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alicia is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a furniture-making business in the Philippines.

Its engine quality is good, but the body is fully damaged. He does not have a sufficient amount to buy a new body and seat covers. He wants to start driving but is looking for a lump sum amount to buy a rickshaw body.Therefore, Parveen requested a loan for her husband so he can buy a new rickshaw body and some spare parts for his rickshaw.

He delivers milk in the market and door-to-door. For delivery purposes, he uses his bicycle. He loads milk cans on his bicycle and delivers it early in the morning. His customers like the fresh and delicious milk he delivers. His monthly savings has become too low due to a rapid increase in the household expenses; the excess utility bills, school fees, uniforms and the expensive books highly affected his savings. He wants to get additional income so that he can cope with the household expenses. However, he finds it difficult due to financial constraints.<br \/><br \/>Therefore, Riaz Hussain plans to purchase one more buffalo to increase his sales, so that he can generate more income and savings as well.

Nobody is going to let you win, and our lives are one long competition, with every loss and win making you stronger. I think every person should understand this.

To win this competition you must know these rules and use them for your profit. \r\n\r\nWhen I was deciding where to go to university, I found that AUCA has the department that fits me best.

Mourice selected as the Kiva representative. Mourice is on the right side in the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 41 other individual farmers represented by this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMourice is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 18 children.  Mourice is 68 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 16 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Mourice is very active in his community and is involved in the savings group.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMourice first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Mourice joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and earn enough to feed family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers.  Mourice plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Mourice\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

the Kiva representative of the group. Patson has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right side of the photo, with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 93 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of KES 5,349 (shillings).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatson is a reliable member of the community. He is married, with 12 children. Patson is 54 years old and he has been working as a farmer for the last 25 years to support his family. In addition to this, Patson is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group. He described his harvest last year as being good. He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatson  joined One Acre Fund in 2009 and he is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Patson joined One Acre Fund, so that he could get the best seed prices. Because he is an active community member, Patson has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund, as a group leader and as a Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Patson 's life because he has more farm training. In the future, Patson  hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nPatson and the Amani Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers, as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5775,"image":{"id":1487056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to obtain hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":5775,"lender_count":136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patson ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylvenus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":497457,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":497457}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5775,"local_amount":497457,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":498266.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722858}],"funded_date":"2014-02-08T20:53:35Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":655663,"name":"Anh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anh is 39 years old and is married with two daughters.

She is applying for an 1,100 USD loan to support her studies. Here is her story:\r\n<p>\r\nSince my childhood I have always wanted to be a diplomat and to serve my country. My dreams are becoming a reality now that I have passed the AUCA entrance exam and spent two years of hard work studying and improving my English.\r\n<p>\r\nWhy did I choose International and Comparative Politics at AUCA?\r\n1) I firmly believe that I will use all of the knowledge, skills and bright ideas from my university classes to develop diplomatic relations between the Kyrgyz Republic and other countries.\r\n2) I am a very sociable person by nature, and I always try to find something in common with different types of people. I love working with people, and I hope to travel and work around the world studying the traditions, customs, and languages of different people.\r\n3) Roza Otunbaeva and Chingiz Aitmatov are my idols. Their tremendous contribution towards the development of Kyrgyz diplomatic affairs makes me want to be a diplomat, and I hope to have the same influence that they did.\r\n<p>\r\nI am absolutely confident that I will be one of the well-known politicians or diplomats of Kyrgyzstan. The future of the country depends on our youth, and I believe that our young people will take the best practices and examples from around the world and use them to develop our country. \r\n<p>\r\nI also would like to thank my parents for their constant support. Thanks to them I could choose to study what I wanted.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1488171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She lives with her husband and her small 3 year old son. Since she finished high school, her mother taught her how to sew, activity that has become her main source of income. Currently she works in her own sewing workshop, located in her home. From there she helps others and generates enough resources to support her husband with home expenses.\r\n\r\nBibiana's purpose is to expand her workshop and buy more machinery to generate employment, but she knows that in order to achieve this she has to work hard, with determination and discipline. This inspires her to request a loan to invest in the purchase of supplies at wholesale prices (fabrics, threads, buttons, among others). This will allow her to have the available material to finish her pending orders in a prompt way. Doing so she will be able to get new contracts resulting in a stronger and more profitable business, that will let her enjoy better life conditions and offer her son a better

with Josephat selected as the Kiva representative of Mabadiliko Group. Josephat has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 63 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum each. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nJosephat is 51 years old and has been a farmer for 31 years. Josephat works as a farmer to provide for his nine children. The community and other farmers know Josephat as friendly, hardworking and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in community groups such as the men's group. Josephat described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Josephat\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, Josephat also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers. Josephat plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school, save for the future and buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and he is able to feed the family. Josephat also joined One Acre Fund because he wants more food surplus. Josephat\u2019s life has also improved because he pays school fees.  \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Josephat and the Mabadiliko Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

Henry has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving farm inputs (hybrid seeds and fertilizer) for one quarter acre of maize and one quarter acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average loan of 5,349 KES.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nHenry is a reliable member of the community.  He is is 48 years old, married, with eight children.  Henry has been working as a farmer for the last 26 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Henry is very active in his community and is involved in a men's group and prayer group.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue to work with One Acre Fund and to enjoy the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Henry\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He joined One Acre Fund in 2010 and has been working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer, and hybrid seeds.  As an active member in his community, Henry also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member.  Henry plans on using future profits from the harvest to invest in a business.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he was able to feed his family and send his children to school.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHenry and the Upendo Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo, standing on the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1487002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To obtain hybrid seeds and fertilizer to improve harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukomere","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Omukala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mutende","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Akhonya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":278148,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278148}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":655677,"name":"Loan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loan is requesting a new loan to buy a range of new products, such as food and beverages, to restock her general store.

She will be able to make progress in making her biggest dream come true - to expand her warehouse, to increase egg production to 1000 hens, and to sell more meat.  She also wants to dabble in breeding and selling fish so that she can reach another market, which would guarantee a stable economic situation so that she can provide a better education for her son and she can enjoy a prosperous future with the people she loves.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1508823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Pratima could not complete her education due to poverty, but she is willing to provide her daughter with a higher education and desires that her daughter not face any obstacle in receiving her education. Pratima\u2019s daughter Priyanka is now studying in class X (Grade 10) and is very serious about her studies. She aims to become a lawyer in the future.  \n\nPratima\u2019s husband has been associated with agricultural activities for many years. But his earnings are hardly enough to cover the educational expenses after meeting the household expenses of their family. \n\nPratima learned about BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) and applied for a loan of 15,000 INR for her daughter\u2019s uninterrupted education. With the loan amount, she will pay the tuition fee and buy necessary articles like books, copies, pens, a geometry box etc. for educational purposes for her daughter.\n \nPratima and her daughter Prianka (as per photo) are very grateful to Kiva and BJS for this loan.

She joined Huikap Pukhri Mapan SHG with nine other women members and they are all hard working. She is the featured borrower for the group and she is pictured with her hand raised. All the members live in the same neighborhood, which is about 45 kms from the capital.\n\nIbemcha weaves all kinds of women's wrap arounds and shawls. During the festive season, which falls between October and March, Ibemcha\u2019s weaving business is at peak. Women from neighboring villages, neighbors and women vendors in the market contact her for woven products for weddings, send-off ceremonials and other meitei celebrations. If she could deliver all the demands on time, then she could make a good income, but it is difficult because she weaves alone, and it takes three or four days to complete one women's wrap around skirts. To supply a dozen of them requires a month. The finished products are usually sold to the women vendors who sit in the main Imphal market in the capital town of Manipur, which is about 45 kms from where she lives. She supplies them at wholesale and that way the generated income is beneficial.\n\nWith the loan, Ibemcha is planning to buy lots of yarns and threads to weave. This is still the wedding season and she has a number demands from the women who sell her products in the main market. Before she took the loan, she used to get her yarn supplies from the shopkeeper on credit and repay  when the woven products are sold. She is happy that with the loan support she does not ask for credit and she can easily make a spot payment and get the full profit without paying half the share to the shopkeepers. She says thank you to Kiva. \n\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving and vegetable selling businesses.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1506379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more yarn and threads","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-09T21:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T21:30:15Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibemcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tombisana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nungshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanao","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjana`","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chaobi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-13T20:07:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":654179,"name":"Abrar Alhodeida Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Abrar Alhodeida.

He has been purchasing milk from the market and selling it as a retailer from his shop. Nowadays, customers are making complaints about the freshness of the milk. This is the reason he wants to buy fresh milk from a wholesaler or from the farms, but their price is higher than market rates. He does not have enough cash in hand to buy fresh milk, but he does not want to compromise quality as well.\r\nTherefore, Khalida requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so her husband would be able to purchase fresh milk from the farms to sell.\r\nShe hopes that she will be able to make savings through profit amounts.

and raising three children with her husband. Jumakan has a secondary education. Her family's primary source of income is Jumakan's work buying, fattening, and reselling cattle. Her husband actively helps her. Today, her farm boasts two dairy cows and fifteen sheep. Her monthly income is 9,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Jumakan approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cattle to fatten and then resell for a profit. Jumakan plans to use profits she makes from the loan to increase her livestock and repair her home.

She was born into a peasant family who found agriculture and cattle raising work to be a good way to earn a living. Thanks to her parents, Erika has been learning this trade since she was a little girl. Now, at 22 years old, Erika makes a living working part-time on a flower farm and she also independently raises cattle. She has dairy cows and raises cattle. She sells her milk to one of her brothers, who has a truck. With this work, Erika earns an income to help her husband with household costs and to support their four children.\r\n\r\nErika is applying for a loan to invest in her business. She will use the money to buy cattle to raise and to buy dairy cows. In addition, she will use some of the loan to pay off another loan. This will allow Erika to increase production and satisfy demand, thus increasing her income from sales.\r\n\r\nErika tells us that her plans for the near future are to continue expanding her business, buying more cattle and taking advantage of the pastures that she has. This will make her business more profitable, and give her a better income and the opportunity to offer her daughter a quality

Mokhidil has a secondary education. She is a housewife, cares for the farm, and is raising a son. Mokhidil's work in animal husbandry is the main source of income for the family. She started this six years ago when she bought 25,000 KGS worth of livestock. Her husband helps her on the farm. Mokhidil has vast experience breeding cattle, and she has everything she needs to keep cattle. Mokhidil harvests the hay and feed herself.  Because of Mokhidil's hard work, her farm now boasts four milk cows and two sheep. She earns a monthly income of 9,500 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Mokhidil has approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cattle to fatten and resell for a profit. Mokhidil plans to invest profits she makes from the loan in increasing her livestock and repairing her family home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1488174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cows to fatten and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ala-Buka village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-10T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-08T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":48.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mokhidil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25251.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178378},{"amount":463.75,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25251.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":48.75,"payment_id":595435909}],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T17:32:59Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":655693,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is 45 years old and runs a photo studio in Kangundo town.

Her husband died in February 2013, and Bazargul was left alone with their children. After her husband's death, Bazargul became involved in farming and livestock in order to find a source of income for the family. She started her business with 2,000 KGS. Thanks to her extremely hard work, Bazargul has had some small successes developing her farm, and she began to earn a monthly income of 8,000 KGS. Currently, Bazargul's farm has two sheep and a 0.60 hectares plot where she grows cotton. All of the children help on the farm. They understand their mother's difficult situation and financial problems. The children diligently try to help their mother with the work. The two older children are working in Russia. They help financially by sending their salary every month to the family in Kyrgyzstan. In order to further develop her farm, Bazargul approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase cotton seed, fertilizer, and pesticide. Bazargul plans to invest profit she makes from the loan into further developing her small farm and eventually building a new house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1488160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

He previously worked as a builder but, given his age, it became difficult to carry out this work. Francisco completed up to sixth grade at school and then went into the building trade. He is married: his wife does the household chores and helps look after the cows that they have. The couple's two daughters now have their own homes.\r\n\r\nUnable to work in construction any longer, Francisco starting growing corn, beans and sorghum. He also has three dairy cows, the milk from which he sells at $0.40 per litre. The three cows produce 25 bottles between them. Francisco has a deal with the person who buys the milk and so he continues with production. The cows and crops are 500 metres from Francisco's house and they require looking after every day.\r\n\r\nFrancisco is applying for a loan to buy a dairy cow as he already has a deal with someone who buys the milk and Francisco must provide the agreed number of bottles. During this dry season milk production decreases due to a lack of feed for the animals. As a result, Francisco has decided to buy another cow which can help him to maintain normal levels of production. That way Francisco can keep his customer satisfied and guarantee an income from this work.\r\n\r\nFrancisco's dream is to have a small farm to breed hens, pigs, goats, cows, horses and other animals and have everything he needs to live a quiet life with his wife."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1508734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

as the Kiva representative of the group.  Fredrick has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 32 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFredrick is a reliable member of the community.  He is married and has nine children.  Fredrick is 46 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 24 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Fredrick is very active in his community and is involved in the savings group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFredrick joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Fredrick joined One Acre Fund so that he could get new farming methods.  Because he is an active community member, Fredrick has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Fredrick's life because he has more profits from harvest.  In the future, Fredrick hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFredrick and the Amani Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

He was born in a village which has good conditions for livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. Amrullo's family had a low income and since childhood he helped his parents with farming. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing high school, Amrullo got married, and his wife helped him with the livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. They mainly worked with cattle breeding, purchasing cattle at a low price at the market, and after a certain time of fattening them, resell them at a higher price.

He is pictured here in a group of four One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 36 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Benard has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum for cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBenard is 65 years old and has been a farmer for three years.  Benard works as a farmer to provide for his nine children.  The community and other farmers know Benard as friendly and hardworking.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group, prayer group and burial committee.  Benard described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Benard\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  As an active member in his community, Benard also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  Benard plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a cow.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, was able to save money and feed the family.  Benard also joined One Acre Fund because he wanted to  eliminate hunger in his home.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBenard and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

Juma has volunteered and was selected to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 56 other individual farmers represented by this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJuma is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 10 children. Juma is 58 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 18 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Juma is very active in his community and is involved in the prayer group. He described his harvest last year as good. He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Juma\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined in 2008 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  As an active member in his community, Juma also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative. Juma plans to use future profits from the harvest to send his children to school.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he was able to feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJuma and the Chebuna Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

As the family has only a seasonal income, Aleksandre decided to start a trading business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The start-up program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1,000 GEL for purchasing calves.  After the calves are purchased, he will start trading them among his villagers.

He is pictured here in a group of 9 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 82 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Egesa has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEgesa is a reliable member of the community. He is married and has 3 children. Egesa is 38 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 15 years to support his family. In addition to this, Egesa is very active in his community and is involved in groups like the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. He described his harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund. He hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer he is able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers that have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season will be Egesa\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He joined this year in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, Egesa has also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Farmers. He believes that his life will improve as a One Acre Fund farmer.\r\n\r\nEgesa and the Imara Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1488232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T01:50:35Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T01:50:35Z","loan_amount":5075,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Egesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chrispinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oundo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":438618,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":438618}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":644028,"name":"Nicolasa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicolasa is 70 years old and married.

As the only breadwinner of the family, Serob works hard to collect a high income and cover the family's basic costs.\r\n\r\nSerob isn't able to complete the many current orders because he does not have enough materials. Therefore, Serob has applied for this loan.

Yuniah loves tea farming because it has greater returns as people can't do without tea and so the market is very high and production is also high.The major challenge with tea farming is lack of rain (because tea has to have rain all year round) and lack of sufficient funds.\r\n\r\nYuniah chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer their loans at a low interest rate.\r\n\r\nThis loan will

He lives in Stepanavan city in Lori region. Armen is married and the father of two very pretty children. For several years Armen had to go to the Russian Federation, and he did there different constructional works in order to provide his family with minimum living conditions. \r\n\r\nFortunately these difficulties now are in past, and it is already four years that Armen is running his business. He has a small shop of his own where he sells fruits and vegetables, which he buys from the villagers of his region (apples, pears, plums, pineapples, bananas, oranges, kiwi, persimmons, and mandarins, also some vegetables like potatoes, cucumbers, greens, broccoli, tomatoes, etc.). \r\n\r\nHis wife helps him very much; she works there as a saleswoman. Their shop is very popular because of great assortment and low prices. \r\n\r\nThe citrus fruits he brings from Georgia once in two weeks on a rented car.

He has a pensioner father, a wife, and a daughter. His wife works as a milkmaid and generates 250 GEL per month. The family owns one milking cow whose products are sold locally. They also have a plot of agricultural land, where they cultivate potatoes for trading. \r\n\r\nIn order to more effectively meet all of his family's needs, Khachatur plans to purchase a stock of fruits and vegetables and start a wide retail business in Ninotsminda.

and two children who are 5 and 4 years old. Because her family has a need for her to earn extra income to support her husband with household expenses, she has set up a trade which she learned from her parents, which is the sale of tortillas. She attends to the business by herself from 4:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. As of yet she has not had any problems running her business. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she will purchase a tortilla press to increase her production.

They have land where they grow different kinds of vegetables for family use and also to sell. The family decided to expand their agribusiness and has requested a loan to purchase a milk cow.  The start-up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Her application was approved under the framework of this program and her loan request is for 1,000 GEL.

lives in a remote region of northern Tajikistan.  She is married and raising four children.  She has been involved in animal husbandry for more than 22 years.  She has all the necessary conditions to develop her business.  She buys livestock, which she fattens for a few months, and then resells her animals at the local market.\r\n\r\nRahima also makes an additional income from growing crops.

Since he buys fish retail, he does not really have much of a margin left. This is why this loan is so important to him: it will allow him to increase his stock.

He and his family live in a rural part of Tajikistan.  Everyone in his family is very close and supportive of one another.  Hakimali makes his living farming livestock; he breeds animals and sells them later for a profit.  He works every day so he can provide for his family, and is helped by his wife, who tends to their animals and sells the milk they produce.  \r\n\r\nRaising livestock provides Hakimali with a good, stable source of income.  As such, he'd like to expand his business by buying some more livestock to raise and resell later.  He hopes his business will be able to successfully grow and be able to provide more money to satisfy he and his family's needs, and would like to thank Arvand in advance for their support.

burglary, the death of his son, and a misunderstanding between family members.\r\n\r\nHe has repaid two previous loans and he will use this loan to operate a poultry farm and buy chicks, medicine, drinkers, and build a safe place to keep the chicks. \r\n\r\nHe has a positive outlook and believes he can be successful because he has contacted closed friends in the business and they shared ideas about proper management.  He has a ready market and he plans to buy a good breed of chicks. \r\n\r\nWith this business activity, the community will have a ready supply of chicks at cheaper rates and they will also benefit from the droppings which will serve as fertilizer for their farms.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, he will save money for future expansion and care for his family's needs. He prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rates and convenient repayment intervals.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1508712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

He works at local village school and lives with his mother, wife and two little daughters (ages 1 and 2 years old). Mkhitar's father is a migrant worker, and from time to time, assists his family financially.\r\n\r\nMkhitar has been involved in agriculture for 15 years. He keeps livestock, including cows, pigs, piglets and chickens. Near the village where Mkhitar and his family live, they own a plot of agricultural land where Mkhitar cultivates potatoes. The gathered milk and meat is sold at a local open market, and Mkhitar is able to gather income for his family. \r\n\r\nRealizing the importance of agriculture income, Mkhitar needs financial support. The loan that he is now requesting will greatly assist him to purchase forage for feeding the livestock in the winter.

is a hard-working woman. She is 23 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi, in the  region of Mukono, in Uganda. She is single and has one child who is currently in school. \r\n\r\nFor the past five years, Shamim has been working hard to manage her soft drinks business, in which she sells sodas, water, juice, and fruits. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shamim has requested a loan of UGX 800,000 (Ugandan shillings) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase another refrigerator, to increase production due to demand. This will help Shamim to generate greater profits and increase the amount of products used in the business. Shamim hopes that, in the future, she will be able to open a bigger shop. \r\n\r\nShamim is a member of BRAC Uganda's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1488463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

For the past 10 years, Grace has been working hard to manage her salon, which deals in plaiting, weaving, and retouching. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase hair products and dryers and will help Grace to generate greater profits and expand business to another area. Grace hopes that in the future she will be able to become an event supplier. \r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Julius has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and he is on the right of the photo, with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to Julius and the 87 individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here, but they will be receiving an average loan of KES 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJulius is a reliable member of the community. He is married, with six children. He is 48 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last ten years to support his family. Julius is also known as Pastor. In addition to this, Julius is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group.  He described his harvest last year as being good. He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Julius\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and he has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, and earn enough money to feed his family. As an active member in his community, Julius also chose to be a group leader and a Kiva representative because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers, and he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Julius plans on using the future profits from the harvest to send his children to school and to buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from the harvest, he has more farm training, he was able to save money, and he was able to feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJulius and the Abangonya Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.
