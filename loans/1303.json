He is married, with six children. He is 48 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last ten years to support his family. Julius is also known as Pastor. In addition to this, Julius is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group.  He described his harvest last year as being good.

He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and he has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, and earn enough money to feed his family. As an active member in his community, Julius also chose to be a group leader and a Kiva representative because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers, and he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Julius plans on using the future profits from the harvest to send his children to school and to buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from the harvest, he has more farm training, he was able to save money, and he was able to feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJulius and the Abangonya Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers, as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5400,"image":{"id":1487547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase his harvest of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":5400,"lender_count":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Otwero","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eshituku","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":465363,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465363}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5400,"local_amount":465363,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":465911.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722855}],"funded_date":"2014-02-09T14:09:34Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":655967,"name":"Jessiely","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jessiely  is studying at Saint Vincent College, taking courses toward a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, with a Major in Financial Management.

As the extracted animal skin is left unused, Minati decided to make leather from the skin of different animals and sell the skins to leather factories for making leather bags, jackets, shoes and various types of things.

40 kms from Imphal town in Manipur which is one of the northeastern states in India. Nengneilhing is one of the group members who runs a variety shop in the village. She is the profiled member for the group and she is pictured with her hand raised.\r\n\r\nNengneilhing generates income for the family by running a variety shop in a village. The village is about 4 and 1\/2 kms from the district town and one has to pay rs.20 to the auto rickshaw driver as the fare to reach the village. She sells small sachets of shampoo, detergent powder, detergent bar soap, onions, garlic, potatoes, cereals etc. Essential needs are sold in the shop as villagers cannot travel to the town market for small items like matches and candles. She usually gets the supplies from the town or at the capital market. The generated income is small and insufficient to manage the family expenses and also to stock a large variety of supplies.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will purchase more cereals, first aid kits and drugs for common illnesses like coughs, diarrhea, and fever. The village is located in a remote place from the town which is a hurdle for easy access to everyday activities, for which reason she is inspired to become the most successful supplier for essential goods in the village.

For the past four years, Jackie has been working hard to manage her pharmacy shop, where she sells drugs and treats people. <br \/><br \/>To help expand her business, Jackie has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more drugs, syringes and gloves. This will help Jackie to generate greater profits and increase her business's products and income. Jackie hopes that in the future, she will be able to provide for her family. <br \/><br \/>Jackie is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is a hard-working woman. She is 21 years old and lives in the town of Nakifuma, in the  region of Mukono in Uganda. She is single and has one child, who is currently in school. For the past seven years, Sarah has been working hard to manage her raw food business, where she sells matooke, Irish potatoes, and beans. <br \/><br \/>To help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more beans, matooke, and Irish potatoes, and will help Sarah to generate greater profits and increase her family's income. Sarah hopes that in the future, she will be able to construct a house out of the profits. <br \/><br \/>Sarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Gulsaira has a high school education.  She is a responsible and a punctual person, who has the experience in running the household and in investing her money into the right channels.  Her neighbors characterize her as an exemplary person and a great mother.  The main income to Gulsaira's family comes from raising livestock, a business that she started 12 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 20,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, she now has two milking cows, two heifers and 35 sheep.  Gulsaira's household has all of the necessities required for raising cattle.  \r\n\r\nGulsaira applies a lot of skill and patients to keep expanding her herd year to year.

She lives with her husband, son, and elderly pensioner mother-in-law. \r\n\r\nShe and her son are employed in the private sector. Their salaries, however, are so low that it is impossible to afford a living based on those salaries alone. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her husband, Nairuhi is engaged in aviculture, viniculture, and in cultivation of cherries and apples. Her husband and son sell the agricultural products in the local market, which is a very important source of family's income. \r\n\r\nTo continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Nairuhi needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase materials used in viniculture (cables, pipes), to prepare the vineyard for the cold season, and to renovate the barn, which is currently in poor condition. The loan will help the family run their agribusiness in a more productive and efficient way. \r\n\r\nNairuhi has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during recent times, she was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. \r\n\r\nNairuhi and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain and develop their agribusiness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2864,"image":{"id":1488487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Uganda. She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past year, Shida has been working hard to manage her clothing business, which sells ladies' and men's clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shida has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes and will help Shida to generate greater profits and educate her child. Shida hopes that in the future she will be able to start a boutique. \r\n\r\nShida is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":1488504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

the region of Iganga in Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past year, Prossy has been working hard to manage her clothing business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prossy has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for sale, and will help Prossy to generate greater profits and pay her rent. Prossy hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nProssy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is independent and hardworking.\r\n\r\nWith her savings, she purchased machinery and improved the conditions of her workshop. She is requesting this loan to buy men's, women's, and children's clothing for the holiday season, and to buy high-quality raw materials to resume sewing athletic wear starting in the month of January 2014. Her  commercial activity includes significant assets: she runs two businesses that generate a steady income. In this season, she hopes to fulfill customer orders.\r\n\r\nLigia gets up early to take care of her house. At mid-morning, she works on cutting fabric to make garments in the afternoon. During the night, she does her billing and sales work. She hopes to give her son an education so that he can become a professional.\r\n\r\nLigia has machinery and equipment for her work, and a clientele to buy her garments. She has extensive experience in sewing, as well as contacts in the United States who enable her to run her business of bringing in quality merchandise and selling it at a good profit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1489676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For the past year, Penninah has been working hard to manage her business, which sells children's and adults' clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business and generate greater profits, Penninah has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda to buy more clothing for resale. The profits will help her to pay her child's school fees.

She is very grateful to God for the different customers she has encountered during her time as a farmer.  As a result, she was able to build a modest house where she can have small family get-togethers and also a place to prepare tamales and sell food as a way of generating more income.  Her land was acquired through a purchase.  \r\n\r\nA disadvantage of this line of work is having to deal with different diseases and pests that affect crops, so she must do whatever she can to prevent exposing her crops and sustaining damage.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative in order to buy farming supplies and certified seed potatoes that she can plant and cultivate.  This will enable her to extend her crop and generate more income.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her children study so that they can become professionals, which will provide them with better opportunities in life and the ability to generate more income to support their families.

She belongs to one of the groups called Mutuma from central Kenya.  As a member, she was among the first women to benefit from a credit to buy a solar package and jikos for her home. The solar package enables her to charge mobile phones and to use a small radio as well as to save on buying kerosene. The jikos (economical cooking stoves) save at least 50 percent of the firewood and the charcoal consumption compared to what she was using before, therefore easing the burden of buying charcoal and collecting firewood daily. The cook stove also reduces smoke emissions, making it better for her health.\r\nSeeing an opportunity, Elizabeth decided to be an entrepreneur by being a distributor for solars and jikos. She approached VEP for financing and received a credit facility that enabled her to purchase small solar systems and jikos to sell to other women in women groups. As she was repaying the loan she also invested some of the profits to grow her business. After clearing the first loan she has approached VEP again for a second loan to boost the stock and she hopes to reap even more profits by targeting larger groups for more sales.\r\nWith this credit

She is trying to make her family\u2019s financial condition better by contributing to her family the whole profit achieved from her own incense business.\r\n\r\nNirobala thanks BJS and Kiva for funding the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1509139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase raw materials (sticks, perfume, etc.) for incense-making.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-01-10T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Niorobala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-11T13:17:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":644061,"name":"Gulruhsor","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0443\u043b\u0440\u0443\u0445\u0441\u043e\u0440 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 1984 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0432\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436 \u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0440\u0443\u0445\u0441\u043e\u0440 3 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0436. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0436\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439. \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0440\u0443\u0445\u0441\u043e\u0440 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 400 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443.

They sell the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of their income. \r\n\r\nTo continue running his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Arman needs a loan of USD 1,200 to purchase necessary materials for greenhouse construction (cellophane and bottles), to purchase fertilizer, and to buy potato seeds. \r\n\r\nArman had taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately, he wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to his hard work during recent times, Arman was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. \r\n\r\nArman and his wife will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1488514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase the necessary materials for greenhouse construction (cellophane and bottles), to purchase fertilizer, and to buy potato seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Haytagh village, Armavir region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T19:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T19:10:10Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":52.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":54.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":59.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":60.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":61.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":61.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":656167,"name":"Jitahidi Msakuzi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary, who is in her late 40s, is married and the mother of two children who are still at school.

The loan will be used to buy more tomatoes and it will help Prossy Rose to generate greater profits that can be diverted to another business.

years old, together with her husband. Meerim has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 2 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Meerim's hard work, today her business contains 1 horse and 4 tons of potatoes.  Meerim leases a 1.0 hectare plot of land, where she plants potatoes, wheat, barley and sainfoin.  She will sell potatoes this month (January) wholesale at 18 som (KGS), which will bring in a good income.  The monthly aggregate income amounts to 14,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Meerim requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep for fattening up and subsequent resale at a market at a high price.  Meerim plans to invest the earnings from the loan into increasing domestic livestock quantities and plans to to save money to buy her own home because today she and her family live in her husband's parents' home together with the husband's parents."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1507772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep for fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Teplokluchenka village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-10T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":35.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meerim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":17831.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178427},{"amount":327.47,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":17831.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":35.03,"payment_id":595435986}],"funded_date":"2014-01-13T12:09:14Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":644175,"name":"Jean Bosco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Bosco is 26 years old.

Since childhood, he has has an affinity for making handicrafts. He collected things that others had thrown away and made them into useful, decorative objects to sell to family and acquaintances. With time, he became responsible for supporting his family, as he had a son at a young age. So he looked for a job that would provide steady income to pay for his family's needs. This meant that he could only work as an artist in his spare time; however, he never lost interest in the profession. He says that it is better to make art from discarded materials and not contaminate the environment; moreover, he can earn additional income for his family by doing this. \r\n\r\nHe has applied for a loan to buy an industrial drill, a hand press, a small bending machine, a welding machine, and some items from a scrap yard. He will be able to make better use of his time and improve his merchandise, specifically for the December holiday season when demand picks up. John dreams of making this work his main source of income, setting up the business, and being able to offer jobs to family members so that he can be totally independent and slowly raise the standard of living of those he loves.

years old, and married. She and her husband have one son who was born this year. Manzuura married Ramil right after finishing school, so she wasn't able to get a higher education. \r\n\r\nManzuura has a high school education and now farms and raises livestock to provide the family's main income. She started four years ago by buying cattle for 5,000 KGS. Due to her hard work, she now has two dairy cows, two calves and 20 sheep. At the same time, Manzuura farms 1.8 hectares on which she grows beans and clover. Her husband helps her, along with her mother-in-law who lives with them. \r\n\r\nTo care for her animals, Manzuura hires a veterinarian twice a year. She has her cattle at home where she has the needed set-up for them. Only in season does she take them to the cattle pasture. She gets income from milk sales and from farming. Her monthly income is 11,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Manzuura would like to take a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners to buy a heifer for cattle breeding. She plans to use the profits to invest in further increasing her herd and save to repair her

He has a wife, son and daughter-in-law. His son works on the bus line and generates 350 GEL monthly. Merab's wife is a saleslady and earns 300 GEL monthly. Merab runs an agricultural business harvesting nuts and kiwi. The products are sold locally and he gets a small income from this activity. Now Merab wants to start another activity that will increase the family's income and be more stable. The startup program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enabled him to get a loan of $4,000 for purchasing a secondhand car.

is a 24-year-old man, from Kutaisi city. His only family member is his grandmother, who gets monthly assistance from the local government. \r\n\r\nPapuna is unemployed at this moment, in spite of having high education. He has great desire to seek a fortune in private business. He decided to start his fast food business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. His credit requests were rejected several times since Papuna didn't satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nPapuna received credit in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo called the Start-up Program, which gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nWith the loan of USD 1,200, Papuna will purchase inventories, such as a display, refrigerator, machine tools, and furniture for his business. This will give him a chance to earn his own income and not depend on others. He dreams to save enough money to provide a secure future for his little family.

Recheal is 24 years old and lives in the town of Pallisa in Uganda.  She is single and has one child.  For the past three years, Recheal has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells rice, sugar and beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Recheal has requested a loan of 900,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more rice, sugar and other items and it will help Recheal generate greater profits, which she will use to pay school fees for her child.  Recheal hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nRecheal is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Ainagul has a high school education.  The main source of income for Ainagul's family is cattle raising, which she started 12 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 10,000 som (KGS).  Her spouse is helping her with running this business.  Thanks to Ainagul's hard work, she currently has two milk cows and 20 sheep.  Ainagul has all of the necessities to keep livestock in her house.  Ainagul milks the cows herself and sells the milk to daily, which provides some additional income.  Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS).  In order to advance her business, Ainagul turned to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy a horse.

With her parents' dedication and support, Brenedinda was able to complete her elementary education, but she was not able to continue studying in high school, as she needed to work to help her parents make ends meet. From a very young age, Brenedinda helped her parents with their farming operations (coffee, corn and beans), leading to her extensive agricultural knowledge and experience. Currently, Brenedinda farms coffee and sells her coffee beans directly to large distributors in the area. Her coffee plants are located about a half mile from her home, and she frequently walks between her house and her crops to make sure they receive consistent attention.\r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan, Brenedinda plans to purchase agricultural input items for tending her coffee plants, including manure, fertilizers and other products. She hopes this investment will help her to strengthen her coffee crops and protect them from pests and disease. Her dream is to eventually purchase machinery that would allow her to complete the entire coffee production process, including removing the skin, drying and then roasting the beans. Brenedinda also hopes to purchase more coffee plants over time to increase the diversity and quality of her harvest, becoming one of the greatest coffee farmers in the region and supporting her children in their dreams along the way.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1489705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase agricultural input items for tending her coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T19:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T19:50:11Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brenedinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1425,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":29212.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542499127}],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T00:51:30Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:22:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gillian Goodrich","image":943697}},{"id":656174,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim is a 27-year-old Lebanese single man living with his parents and three siblings.

because lately, he has financial problems.  He is 51 years old, married and is raising six children.  The climate of his region is favorable to raising crops and raising cattle.  For more than 10 years, Abdurauf has been raising livestock.  He sells milk to his neighbors, who are very grateful for having access to naturally produced milk.  Also, he fattens cattle for a few months and then sells it.  Beside these activities, he also keeps bees, and at the moment, he has 40 bee houses.  He has many clients at the market.

She is 20 years old and lives in the town of Busia in the region of Iganga in Uganda. She is married and has one child who is currently in school. For the past year, Jackline has been working hard to manage her clothing business, which sells clothes for children and ladies. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jackline has requested a loan of 150,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes and will help Jackline to generate greater profits and pay house rent for her and her siblings. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to start up a tailoring school. \r\n\r\nJackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Since childhood, Rajabali has been helping his father work in the barnyard, and he has learned a lot from his father. He only started doing this as a business two years ago.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Kayirma has a secondary education. The livestock business is the family's primary source of income. Kayirma started this business 24 years ago when she bought a cow for 5,000 KGS. Because of Kayirma's hard work, her farm currently boasts four milk cows, one horse, and fifteen sheep. Kayirma has extensive experience breeding livestock. Twice a year she brings in a veterinarian to vaccinate all of her livestock. She also shears her sheep twice a year and sells the fleece. Kayirma milks all of her cows, making cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream and kefir, which she then sells to wholesalers. Her dairy products are fresh and homemade. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Kayirma approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding. Kayirma flans to use profits from the loan to further expand her livestock, and she plans to save enough money to build a new home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1489024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

Her son is 22 years old. He is working in Russia, and every month he sends part of his salary home to support his parents. Burmakan is very respected among the villagers. She has extensive experience in agriculture. Burmakan has a secondary education. The livestock business is the family's primary source of income. Burmakan started it 26 years ago when she bought 4,000 KGS worth of livestock. Because of Burmakan's hard work, her farm currently boasts five dairy cows, two mares, and 23 sheep. Every year from April to September, Burmakan milks the mares to make the traditional drink called \"kumis\" to sell. Kumis is a very nutritious and healthy drink. She milks the cows year-round and sells the milk. She earns a monthly income of 6,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Burmakan approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a horse for breeding. Burmakan plans to invest profits from this loan into increasing her livestock, and she plans to save enough money to buy a new home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1488438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

She is 16 years old and lives in the town of Namutumba in the region of Iganga in Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past year, Judith has been working hard to manage her clothing business, which sells children's clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Judith has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for all ages, and will help Judith to generate greater profits. Some of the profits will be used to pay fees for herself. Judith hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a retail shop. \r\n\r\nJudith is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past 2 years, Annet has been working hard to manage her produce business, which sells beans, rice and groundnuts. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more produce, and will help Annet to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. She hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

The loan will be used to buy braids, oils and shampoos, and will help her to generate greater profits, some of which will be used to educate her child. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She lives with her four school age children (three sons - 11, 9, and 6 years old, and an 8-year-old daughter) and her father-in-law. To take care of her family Anna is engaged in cattle breeding, aviculture, breeding pigs, and cultivation of wheat, corn, grass, and several fruits (plums, quince, pomegranates, figs, blood oranges, apples, pears, and walnuts). With the help of her father-in-law, Anna sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of the family\u2019s income. To continue running her agribusiness in a sustained way, Anna needs a loan of USD 600 to purchase forage (grass and combined forage) for the livestock. As this is Anna\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who did not have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. Anna and her large family rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will be very thankful to them for their

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

who has raised one son by herself. Her son is 26 years old, married and has 2 children.  He lives with Chynar and helps her with the housework. Chynar has a secondary education. In order to make money to support the family, Chynar raises livestock. She started one year ago, with the purchase of a cow for 50,000 KGS. Thanks to Chynar's hard work, today she has one dairy cow and one bull. The cow gives 15 liters of milk per day. Every day, Chynar gives dairy processers 20 KGS. The monthly income from the sale of milk is 9,000 KGS. Her son also helps her financially. In order to further grow her business, Chynar has turned to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan for the purchase of sheep for fattening and re-selling. Chynar plans to invest the loan income in further increasing the amount of domestic animals, and intends to repair her

The group is composed of 12 women who earn their living from raising animals like cattle, pigs, turkeys, ducks and chickens. They need additional capital to maintain, enhance or expand their businesses and decided to apply for a loan with Friendship Bridge. They are excited and full of hope to begin this new year with solid goals and dreams.\r\n\r\nJosefa is a 24-year-old married mother of three children who range in age from four to six. She completed three years of formal education but due to the poor economical condition of her family, had to leave her education behind. Along with all the clients of Friendship Bridge, Josefa realizes that education is a vital key to a successful future for her children. She shares that her business is running quite well and, because of its success, she will be able to register her first child in school this year! Her husband shares the same goals for the children. Josefa raises animals like bulls, pigs and chickens. She is applying for a loan with Friendship Bridge which will be her second loan cycle. The requested funds will be used to purchase two bulls as well as feed to fatten all the animals. With an optimistic spirit and positive attitude, Josefa looks forward to this new year with its challenges, blessings and successes.\r\n\r\nAll of the women of the Trust Bank \u201cLas Palmas\u201d look forward to their monthly meetings.  During these meetings, held with a Loan Officer from Friendship Bridge, the ladies learn about topics like budget administration (first topic of the year), debt, health and nutrition, and self-esteem. The combination of loans and education is a recipe for empowerment for the women of the Trust Bank!\r\n\r\nOn behalf of her colleagues, Josefa expresses gratitude and appreciation for the support from KIVA investors throughout the world who lend such necessary and vital support.

He has a high school education and is the main breadwinner for his family. For 30 years Koshaly has raised livestock, starting with buying cattle for 1,000 KGS. Thanks to his hard work, he now has four dairy cows, 25 sheep and four horses. \r\n\r\nHe is very enterprising and purposeful and always tries to reach his goals. His wife and children help with the livestock. His wife milks the cows and delivers the milk. Koshaly himself takes the cattle out to graze and prepares food in the winter. His children clean the stables and change the water. The livestock have everything they need. \r\n\r\nTheir monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to support his household, Koshaly took a loan from the microfinance organization, Bai-Tushum and Partners, to buy a cow for breeding. He will use the income from the loan to invest in increasing his herd and to save to build a new house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1489036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kurulush village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-12T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":56.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koshaly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":204.1,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10100.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.9,"payment_id":467831069},{"amount":205,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10100.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462989},{"amount":192.9,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10100.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.1,"payment_id":561578162},{"amount":180.48,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10100.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.52,"payment_id":624798788},{"amount":186.02,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":10100.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.98,"payment_id":664995314}],"funded_date":"2014-01-07T17:17:29Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margaret Rosen","image":null}},{"id":644320,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is a 29-year-old wife and mother of two living in Wedza District.

For him, Dushanbe is not just a city.  It is a special place where he was born, where he grew up, and where he is now studying and working.\r\n\r\nAmriddin still lives with his parents who have taught him to be responsible, honest and goal-oriented.  He is currently enrolled as a fourth-year student at the Technological University in Dushanbe.

Farming inputs will be delivered to him as one of the 62 individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 KES.\r\n\r\nJames is 66 years old and has been a farmer for 42 years. James works as a farmer to provide for his nine children. The community and other farmers know James as an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community activities such as the men\u2019s group, savings group, and prayer group. James described his harvest last year as good, but he hopes to have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains Season won\u2019t be James\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012, and he has continued working with One Acre Fund to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer, and hybrid seeds. As an active member in his community, James also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader who wants to help more farmers. James plans on using future profits from the harvest to repair the home, to send children to school, and to save for the future. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more farm training and was able to save money and to feed the family.\r\n\r\nJames and the Emukaya SHG Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1487088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-12T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naomy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stellah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":331638,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331638}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3850,"local_amount":331638,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":333294.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722861}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T01:27:25Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Youngberg","image":null}},{"id":644356,"name":"Sylvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sylvia is 24 years old, married and a mother of one.
