","en":"Gaffor continues to run the baking business he inherited from his father.  He really appreciates this buisness, because, after all, it lets him provide for his family.

husband are raising 3 children.  Her eldest, Nursultan, is 17; her youngest son, Bekbolsun, is 13; and her only daughter, Aizirek, is 15.  All her children are in school.  Salkinay has a secondary level education and goes through life with optimism. She knows what she wants and goes after it will everything she has.  Salkinay knows how to plan and properly use her money to reach her goals.\r\n\r\nHer family's main income is Salkinay's animal husbandry business, which she started 16 years ago with the purchase of 10,000 som (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Salkinay has 5 milk cows and 15 sheep, and she has everything necessary for raising cattle:  a barn for keeping them and nearby pastures.  She keeps the milk cows at home all year so she can look after them herself, but she sends the sheep off with a shepherd from March through October.  Plenty of hay and feed are always ready.  Her monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Salkinay applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy calves to increase the size of her herd.  She plans invest the profits from the loan in further increasing the number of cattle she owns, and to save up money to build a new house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1489072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kurulush village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-12T12:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-10T12:50:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salkinay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":25251.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462990},{"amount":482.24,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25251.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.26,"payment_id":579488753}],"funded_date":"2013-12-12T17:12:16Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":644457,"name":"Shirley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirley is 52 years old and is married with nine children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by pig fattening in the Philippines.

She has three children from this civil union who are seven, four and three years old. Her oldest two children are enrolled in the local elementary school. Nancy's husband works in construction and they live in a rental because they do not own their own home. \r\n\r\nNancy spends her time at home caring for her small children. However, in order to help her husband the household expenses, she raises animals including livestock, guinea pigs and chickens. She also works in agriculture, selling what she harvests within her community and in the city. The money from the loan will be invested in the purchase of chickens, guinea pigs and animal feed. Her dream is to have her own house.

She has been running a bar in a district in the capital for ten years where she sells bottled beverages and food. Over the course of time, she acquired experience in this domain enabling her to earn a considerable customer base.

She operates a grocery business that she started two months ago because she wanted to help her husband with their everyday expenses and improve the family's finances.  A grocery business made the most sense because she had more than 3 years of experience working at similar businesses before and she wanted to make the most of what she learned.  She works Mondays to Sundays, from early in the morning.  She sells the everyday products that everyone needs.  \r\nDora's immediate goal is to strengthen her business so that it becomes the \"go-to\" grocery for the area.  Her long-term goal is to build a profitable business that will, in turn, provide a better life for her family.  \r\nDora is applying for a loan that she will use to buy bulk supplies of merchandise (soft drinks, dairy, cold meats, chocolate, snacks, baked goods, eggs and other everyday grocery products) for her grocery business.  The investment will allow her to offer a wider range of products and meet demand from local shoppers.  Her margins will go up, she says, and she will use the profit to reinvest in the business and help provide for her family.

The loan she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of glazed pottery in different styles so that she can satisfy her customers.  Moving forward, she would like to grow and open additional branches of her business.  \r\n\r\nOn behalf of her group, Susana would like to thank the Kiva lenders for this loan.

Support from her husband isn't enough to meet all the needs of such a large family so Norelia started her own sewing business to generate an extra income.  A sewing business made the most sense to her because she'd always liked sewing.  She built the business with past loans, taking classes, buying sewing machines and setting up her own workshop.  She makes clothing to order and has her own line of pajamas and clothing for children.  The business is profitable and helps provide for her children.  Norelia works every day from 6am to 8pm and can rely on help from one of her daughters to finish orders.  \r\nNorelia is applying for a loan that she will use to buy the supplies she needs--material, thread, buttons--to make school uniforms ahead of the coming school-year.  The investment will allow her to sell more and increase her income.  \r\nNorelia wants a better future for her children and says she'll keep working to build and expand her business.  She also wants to create jobs for other mothers like her who want to build better lives for their children.

She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Hope) 2. This group is located in the rural area surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industries dominate the economy. Raynold makes his home in a simple structure with his three children and his long-term partner. He says that his most important challenge is to work hard by selling more products to provide for his family.\r\n\r\nRaynold is excited to be taking his 8th loan with Esperanza, having repaid his previous loans and grown his business. He plans to use this loan to invest in his business by buying shoes, clothes and cosmetics such as body lotion, perfume, deodorant and other products.

She is a mother of three children. She would like to use a Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase production. With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

They both still attend school. She breeds chickens that she sells. Her business functions well, but she does not have enough chicks so every time she wants to buy some she has to sell her whole stock in order to be able to buy more which means that she is constantly  out of stock. That is why she requests this loan that will enable her to increase her stock of chicks to provide for the sales of the end of the year festivities. This will increase not only her sales, but also her profit. Some of her profits  will be invested to expand her business and the remainder will be used for her family's

She is a vendor at the public market, where she sells a variety of dried fish. She has done this work for almost four years and earns a net income of PHP 500 daily.

is 43 years old.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The program manager will facilitate supplier relationships and ensure the data collection systems are in place to capture carbon revenue. \r\n\t\r\n\u2022\tSetting up \u201cCarbon Tracker\u201d: MicroEnergy Credits has developed carbon offset data management software called Carbon Tracker that enables an MFI to track clean energy product sales and delivery. This database is used to generate investment-grade carbon offsets and plays an integral role in after-sales services and monitoring. Part of this loan will be used set up Juhudi Kilimo with this software.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tEstablishing a carbon offset program at Juhudi Kilimo: MicroEnergy Credits facilitates the carbon origination, validation, and purchase agreements for the offsets generated by the MFIs clean energy loans. The up-front costs of this will be partially covered by this loan.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHiring MicroEnergy Officers (MEO): MEOs are front-line staff who will be placed at the branches within Juhudi Kilimo, and are providing clean energy marketing, last-mile distribution, and after-sales and warranty support.\r\n\t\t\r\nJuhudi Kilimo and MicroEnergy Credits seek Kiva funding to design, pilot, and scale a sustainable clean energy program to empower rural farmers with access to efficient cook stoves, solar lighting, water filters and biogas digesters.  \r\n\r\nMillions of families and small businesses around the world use outdated technology to light and warm their homes, cook their food, and clean their drinking water. The majority of rural Kenyans use inefficient stoves for cooking that use wood or charcoal for fuel, but these stoves produce harmful emissions and have a significant detrimental effect on health. Similarly, many rural Kenyans are not connected to the electricity grid and rely on kerosene lanterns for light, however these technologies produce emissions that are harmful to the users' health. \r\n\r\nThree main barriers exist that prevent the poor from upgrading to newer, cleaner, more efficient technologies:\t\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPoor distribution: poor infrastructure and low population density inhibit clean energy supplier outreach. \t\r\n\u2022\tLack of marketing: rural farmers have limited access to markets and information about new products. In many instances,  \r\n        purchasing a new product requires a clear explanation of the value proposition. \r\n\u2022\tAccess to finance: many clean energy technologies are only affordable through credit mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help Juhudi Kilimo, with the assistance and technical support of MEC, to address these barriers by connecting Juhudi to clean energy suppliers and carbon finance.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be repaid by MEC on behalf of Juhudi Kilimo with carbon offset revenues, and also by the margin that MEC will earn from purchasing technologies from clean energy suppliers. Loan repayments will come from MEC\u2019s profits.

From the very beginning of his business, his attitude was such that he worked seriously and responsibly. Masharif is a simple shepherd in Kulob. For his entire life he has worked for the benefit of his family, parents, wife, and children. Masharif is a faithful and honest man. He has worked in a barnyard for many years. In many areas, most Tajiks work primarily farming and keeping livestock. Masharif is among them--he is actively involved in animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nWinter came, and Masharif already managed to put his cattle up in the barn. He decided to increase the number of livestock he has in order to expand his small business. He is asking for a loan to buy a couple head of cattle and food for them. Masharif is in rather a hurry to stock up on hay and other types of feed for his cattle. Masharif hopes that you will help him.

Milka has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\n\nMilka is married and has 2 children.  She is 35 years old and is known for being hardworking and trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group.  Milka has been a farmer for 7 years.  Milka described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMilka first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2006 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Milka joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she wants to help more farmers.  Milka plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Milka\u2019s own life was improved because she was able to feed the family.\n\nMilka and the Buruburu Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe field officer is also included in

He is a father of five children. He would like to use the Kiva loan to buy fertilizer and support labor costs during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

For this reason, she is requesting a loan in order to strengthen her business.  The money will be used to buy a milk-producing cow and to pay off the balance of an outstanding debt.  This will help to increase production and generate a higher level of profit from her sales.  <br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda says that her main interest is continuing her business and taking advantage of the space on her farm in order to continue production.  This will enable her to support her children by providing them a better quality education.  In the future, she wants them to become well-rounded individuals who can forge ahead and have a successful life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1509307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

selected as the Kiva representative.  Paulo has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 52 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nPaulo is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 5 children.  Paulo is 61 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 11 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Paulo is very active in his community and is involved in the savings group.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season will be Paulo\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He joined this year in order to get the best seed prices, and get new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  As an active member in his community, Paulo also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and wants to help more farmers.  Paulo plans on using future profits from the harvest to save for the future, and invest in a business.  He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest and was able to feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nPaulo and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":1489350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-13T04:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-11T04:30:07Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janepher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":278148,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278148}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3225,"local_amount":278148,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":279607.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722864}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T19:11:38Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Pittenger","image":278831}},{"id":644670,"name":"Veli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veli is 47 years old, married with two children.

Gibblen has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.

He is 66 years old and is known as hardworking.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group.  Gibblen has been a farmer for 5 years.

Gibblen joined One Acre Fund so that he could earn enough to feed family.  Because he is an active community member, Gibblen has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Gibblen's life because he was able to feed the family.  In the future, Gibblen hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to buy a cow.  \t\r\n\r\nGibblen and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGerald is married and has 2 children.  He is 52 years old and is known as a reliable and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and savings group.  Gerald has been a farmer for 3 years.  Gerald described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGerald first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season.  Gerald joined One Acre Fund in order to get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and wants to help more farmers.  Gerald plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, and save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Gerald\u2019s own life was improved because he had more profits from harvest, had more farm training and was able to feed his family.   \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGerald and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5125,"image":{"id":1489317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-13T05:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-11T05:50:03Z","loan_amount":5125,"lender_count":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerald","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getray","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Byram","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":443967,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443967}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5125,"local_amount":443967,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":444337.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722862}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T18:11:46Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":644689,"name":"Exequila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Exequila works hard to support her family.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 45 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package of a \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Absolom is pictured on the right of the group with his hand raised.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAbsolom is a reliable member of the community, and he is married with 8 children.  Absolom is 65 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 4 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Absolom is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group and prayer group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with its farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2014 long rains season won\u2019t be Absolom\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2010 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  As an active member in his community, Absolom also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is a community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers.  Absolom plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school and save for the future.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more farm training, was able to save money and was able to feed his family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAbsolom and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

This will, in turn, increase her sales and her profit margin.

raised in a rural area.  Since animal husbandry is one of the main types of work among the residents of her village, she has more than just heard about how to take care of cattle.  Mukaram is now 42 years old, married, and has four children.  Her family, like many others, is in the business of raising cattle and producing milk.  Her husband is in the transport business.  Her eldest son moved away to find work.  The remaining children help Mukaram and her husband.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide her children with an education one day and to properly marry them off, the family has to expand its business, and with the oncoming cold season, they have to stock up on feed for the winter.  Some of her acquaintances recomended that she get a loan from MDO Arvand.  Mukaram decided to take out a loan from MDO Arvand and submitted her application.  She plans to use the funds to buy livestock feed in bulk.  She would like to thank MDO Arvand in advance for the financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1485164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

After having tried several different businesses without success, she started this business of selling tubers, vegetables, and fruits. She finds that she can earn enough with this work.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy her customers, Salimata, eight years ago, decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.

Burhon's eldest son is already an independent young man. At the moment, he is out of the country, having left for work abroad in Russia. Burhon's wife is involved with raising the children and working around the household. <br \/><br \/>Like all rural residents, Burhon's family is also involved in raising livestock, that is, buying and selling cattle. But this is not Burhon's main job. Burhon has himself a small shop in the center of the village. He was always drawn to eastern cooking, loved the delicious dishes and most importantly the useful nutrients. Over time, Burhon's desires and interests have been fulfilled in his activities. He began to produce and sell our national dishes. Similarly, Burhon makes all of our famous, beloved traditional \"sambusu\" (meat pies), which he bakes in a special tandoor ovens. His wife helps him in this work. But for preparing sambusu, Burhon does not trust anyone; he prepares those himself. Customers are very pleased and glad that even in their village such a place can be found, where one can get a quick and tasty snack. <br \/><br \/>Burhon's work went well, and the business is slowly developing. Burhon first of all thanks MDO Arvand. Since he took money in a loan, he started his own business and has been working with this organization for two years. Here again Burhon wants to take a loan to purchase a few bags of flour and butter. He expresses his gratitude for the support and trust!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1474063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to  buy flour and butter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-13T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-11T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":283.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":291.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":300.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":308.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":317.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":326.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":336.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":345.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":355.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":366.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":376.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":390.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":122.19,"local_amount":574.99,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":583.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673609},{"amount":63.75,"local_amount":300.02,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":304.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144400},{"amount":65.6,"local_amount":308.69,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":313.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960216},{"amount":67.49,"local_amount":317.61,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":322.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180976},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":326.79,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":331.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875572},{"amount":461.53,"local_amount":2171.9,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2203.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302798}],"funded_date":"2014-01-30T18:31:00Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":645559,"name":"Deysi Rubelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Deysi, es casada, tiene dos hijos, vive junto a su esposo y sus hijos en casa propia, desde muy joven aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres la elaboraci\u00f3n de petates, oficio que actualmente lo desempe\u00f1a para apoyar a su esposo con los gastos de su hogar, tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la crianza  de cerdos y ganado, por el momento no se le hace dif\u00edcil realizar dichas actividades.\nCon el capital ella comprar\u00e1 una vaca y tule que es la materia prima para elaborar los petates que luego vende por mayor, espera fortalecer el negocio, aumentar la producci\u00f3n, tener mejores ingresos con los que podr\u00e1 cancelar las cuotas de la deuda y mejorara las condiciones de vida de su familia.\nSue\u00f1a con tener los recursos necesarios para reparar su vivienda.\n","en":"Deysi is married and has two children.

All her children are married and are migrant workers in Russia except for her oldest, who lives with her and helps her with her daily chores.  Her other children periodically send money back home to help support their mother.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and is a crop- and livestock farmer.  She first started raising livestock 34 years ago with 3,000 som worth of animals, and, thanks to her persistence, currently has 2 dairy cows and 2 hectares of land for growing corn and clover (which she uses to feed her cows), while her monthly income has risen to nearly 15,000 som.\r\n\r\nTo further develop her farm, Kanzada is seeking a loan from Bai Tushum & Partners to buy some bull calves, which she plans on raising and fattening to resell at a profit.  She hopes to use any future profits due to the loan to continue to buy even more livestock for her farm.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1508519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal
