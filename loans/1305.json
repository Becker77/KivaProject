For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Three of the children are of school age, and one is younger. Zinat's elderly mother-in-law lives together with Zinat's family. The mother-in-law helps Zinat care for and bring up the children. \r\n\r\nZinat has secondary education. She married Jeenbekov right after finishing school, and together they started working with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. They started 13 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zinat's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow, three sheep, three lambs and also a plot of land of 0.80 hectares, on which she grows beans and clover. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zinat turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase calves to increase the number of livestock. Zinat plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock, and plans to save money for the future education of her

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.

Peninah has been a farmer for 30 years. She described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nPeninah first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Peninah joined One Acre Fund in order to learn new farming methods and to earn enough to feed family. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Peninah plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school and to buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Peninah\u2019s own life has improved because she has more farm training and was able to feed the family.

Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4525,"image":{"id":1489430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-13T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-11T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":4525,"lender_count":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caleb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Morris","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Praxedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":390477,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390477}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4525,"local_amount":390477,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":392317.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722869}],"funded_date":"2014-02-11T00:12:18Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":656256,"name":"Leonardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonardo es un hombre de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, casado y padre de un hijo de 8 a\u00f1os, a quien ha sacado adelante con mucho esfuerzo.\nDurante su vida productiva se ha dedicado a trabajar de manera independiente, haciendo reparaciones de art\u00edculos en cuero, esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 por medio de la observaci\u00f3n y se ha convertido en su principal fuente de ingresos; lleva muchos a\u00f1os realizando la labor y por ello ya es reconocido en el sector, adem\u00e1s reparte volantes publicitarios en otros barrios aleda\u00f1os con el fin de atraer nuevos clientes y poder generar mejores ingresos para sustentar las necesidades b\u00e1sicas de su familia.\nSolicita su primer cr\u00e9dito con el \u00e1nimo de comprar materia prima al por mayor (retazos de cuero, hilos, agujas, bet\u00fan para cuero, entre otros), esto le permitir\u00e1 tener disponibilidad de insumos para cumplir con los trabajos que le encargan y as\u00ed entregar el art\u00edculo de manera oportuna a sus clientes. \nLeonardo se proyecta hacia el futuro, cambiando el lugar de residencia, para ubicarse en una zona m\u00e1s visible y que sea de f\u00e1cil acceso para sus clientes, as\u00ed podr\u00e1 mejorar las ventas y brindar a su familia mejores condiciones de vida y una educaci\u00f3n de mayor calidad a su hijo.\n","en":"Leonardo is 35 years old, married, and the father of 8 children who he has gotten ahead with great effort.\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime he has worked on his own, repairing leather items, and learned this by watching.

She lives with her husband and 9 year old son. Susanna works in the postal service, and her husband works as a contractual serviceman in the military service. Both of them work hard to be able to earn a living. Their salaries, however, are not enough to cover the daily expenses of the family. \r\n\r\nIt has been more than 15 years since Susanna was engaged in cattle breeding, in aviculture (breeding birds), in breeding sheep, and in the cultivation of several fruits (peach, apricot, apple, pear, and walnut). With the help of her husband, she realizes the agricultural products needed in the local market, which is a very important source of their income. \r\n\r\nTo continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Susanna needs a loan of USD $2,500 to purchase six sheep and a calf and to make previous credit repayments. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Susanna was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Susanna and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1489492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her salary, however, is not enough to effectively meet her family's needs. To be able to cover those needs, Anahit is also engaged in breeding livestock (a cow and a pig), in beekeeping and in the cultivation of potatoes. She sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is a very important source of the family's income. Her daughter assists her greatly in everyday activities related to farming. \r\n\r\nAnahit currently needs to make some investments in her agribusiness in order for it to function in a sustained way. She needs a loan of USD 600 to purchase forage (grass and barley) for the livestock. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during recent times, Anahit was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

So the girl began sending out her resume to find seasonal student employment. She found a job at a neighbourhood book and stationary store. Natali took advantage of the opportunity and was such a good seller, that the owner had her stay on as a permanent employee. She began to save and opened a savings account. After six months working in the bookstore, the girl told her mother \"Mom, I want to study.\" Her mother replied: \"Daughter, today a few young people came by handing out flyers about an institute.\" On her day off, she went to the school with her mother to decide. That's how she started studying technical marketing and sales. The owner of the bookstore congratulated her for wanting to be successful and he allowed her to continue working part-time. As a result, her income was no longer the same. The girl completed a portion of the program, reaching the part that required her to do an internship. She no longer had time to continue working, so she left her job at the bookstore.

She also owns a small shop for daily consumption. Luisa intends to use the year-end holiday to sell a bit more. She is applying for a new loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to buy products such as perfumes, new jewelry designs, and seasonal clothing to fill more of her shop.

years ago, in the second largest city in Guatemala, Quetzaltenango. It is composed of eleven female entrepreneurs, who are engaged in various commercial ventures such as the sale of clothing, cosmetics and perfumes, the manufacture of shoes, and the operation of small shops selling useful items for daily consumption.\r\n\r\nFlorinda is a 47-year-old member of the Vida Trust Bank group. She is married with five children. Along with her husband, Florinda owns a shoe workshop and has seven employees. Four of the employees are family members and two are employees who live nearby. With the year-end holidays quickly approaching, Florinda anticipates increased business. She is applying for a new loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to buy material to make shoes. Florinda, along with her husband are pleased to access this vital financial capital so that they can purchase additional supplies. As with almost all of the clients of Friendship Bridge, the greatest hope that Florinda has is to see her children continue with their education and hopefully, graduate from college. She realizes they will enjoy more opportunities with increased education.\r\n\r\nAll of the women in the Vida Trust Bank group appreciate the confidence of KIVA investors. They say that the loans not only help them but also their families. The women are most pleased to be able to enroll their children in school in the coming year. They also look forward to saving a little as well. Finally, the women of the Vida Trust Bank group want to extend their very best wishes for good health and prosperity to KIVA investors throughout the world."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6125,"image":{"id":1489806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To

She is solely responsible for meeting the basic needs of her children. She strives to provide good nutrition for her children, which will hopefully keep them in good health, and works hard to buy clothing for them and to give them the opportunity to attend school. \r\n\r\nIngrid owns a small shop where she sells items for daily consumption. One month ago, she opened a \u201ctortilleria\u201d where she sells tortillas three times each day. Tortillas are a staple food in Guatemala, made with 100% corn (maize) and essential in the Guatemalan highlands. Ingrid is requesting a loan which she will use to purchase maize in quantity so that she can meet the demands of her customers. In addition, she will purchase items for her store such as beans, pasta, snacks, sodas and purified water. Ingrid had the opportunity to start college and study law but because she needed to put the health and well-being of her children as her highest priority, she decided to put her energy into her two businesses. She understands how important it is for her children to have an education.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman is an example of the ten women in the Abril Trust Bank group. They are requesting loans with Friendship Bridge that they will use in their micro-businesses. Some of these business endeavors include the sale of beauty items, food, cleaning supplies, clothing and tortillas. Others have small shops like Ingrid where they sell essential items for daily consumption.\r\n\r\nAll of the women in the Abril Trust Bank group send special greetings this holiday season to KIVA investors throughout the world, wishing them peace and harmony. They want to express their appreciation for the loans.

frail woman with a strong spirit and the firmness of a man. After her husband's illness she discovered her strength, didn't give in, and set her children on their feet. It was very hard for her at first, since she couldn't find work because she lacks a college education. But she gathered her strength and decided to be a small scale entrepreneur. First she became a seller of household items. Then she started working at the same time as a janitor in a school. Her grown children also help their mother and each other. To help her son with his work, Sanoat decided to buy him a car. Her son plans to work mornings and evenings as a transport driver of sausage products, and during the day as a taxi driver. Sanoat came to MDO Arvand for help with this goal. She very much hopes for and trusts the support she receives through Arvand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1504666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

her spouse. Her husband is a club manager and has a steady income from his salary. Janarkul has a high school education. She takes an optimistic view on life, knowing exactly what she wants and using all her abilities to get there. Janarkul knows how to use and manage money to reach a goal. Janarkul practices animal husbandry to earn the primary income for her family. She started 20 years ago with the purchase of 5,000 som KGS worth of animals. Thanks to her tireless work she now has two horses, two dairy cows, three calves, 10 sheep, and nine goats. She has everything needed to keep animals: a barn to keep them in and pasture. The diary cows are always kept near the house and the family looks after them themselves. The sheep are taken to pasture from March to October by a shepherd. Hay and feed for the animals are readied in sufficient amounts. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop the business Janarkul asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a horse to increase her livestock herd. She plans to use income from use of the loan to invest in further increasing her number of livestock, and she also plans to save some for her oldest daughter to attend college to study education, since the daughter is finishing high school this year and plans to go to college.

Sonunbu has a high school education, is very fair, responsible, and conscientious, and follows her ethics. Sonunbu earns the primary income for her family by raising livestock. She started 22 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS) worth of animals. Thanks to her tireless work she now owns a dairy cow, 25 sheep, and a 1.0 hectare parcel of land where she raises watermelon and cantaloupe. The income from her field crops is around 150,000 som (KGS) per year. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further expanding her business, Sonunbu is asking the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy sheep and their feed. She will later sell them at the market for a profit. She plans to invest income from the loan into further expanding her number of livestock, and also plans to save some funds for her son's wedding.

He is 25 years old, married, and has a two-year-old daughter. He has a large, friendly family comprised of his mother, younger brother, and older brother with his wife and children. They all live together. Daler's older brother is 41 and has four children. His younger brother is 9. Daler is happy and thanks God that he has such a large and wonderful family.\r\n\r\nDaler wants to start a new business. He decided to open his own grocery store.

He is pictured here in a group of 6 One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 73 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Joseph has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.<br \/> <br \/>Joseph is 62 years old and has been a farmer for 46 years. He works as a farmer to provide for his eight children. The community and other farmers know Joseph as a friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and experienced farmer.<br \/><br \/>In addition to farming, he is also involved in community activities such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Joseph described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.<br \/> <br \/>Joseph joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. He joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed his family. Because he is an active community member, Joseph wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Joseph has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Joseph's life because he has more profits from his harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support and is able to save money. In the future, Joseph hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a goat, and invest in a business.<br \/><br \/>Joseph  and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. <br \/> <br \/>The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4525,"image":{"id":1489458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T00:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T00:50:09Z","loan_amount":4525,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Allan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":390477,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390477}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4525,"local_amount":390477,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":392317.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722873}],"funded_date":"2014-02-11T19:14:07Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":639153,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is an enterprising man living in Hoima, Uganda.

Most of the members here are itinerant business people, vendors in the markets and also seamstresses. \r\n\r\nEdith worked in La Vega for 20 years, but when there was a fire in 2009 she left her stall in La Vega because the landlords raised their prices a lot. This is why she decided to start a business in an independent manner and began to sell empanadas, tamales and sopapillas. Her family is very entrepreneurial; her children have also helped her to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe money she is asking for is to be able to buy supplies like beef, oil, flour, chicken and corn, as she currently has no money to be able to make her foods and sell them. She hopes she does well with the sales, because her customers have asked her for products but she doesn't have any way to make them.\r\n\r\nWhat she has liked most about working with Fondo Esperanza is feeling accompanied and supported by an institution. She has met a lot of people and that makes her very happy.

Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":645021,"name":"Margaret's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is a member of this group in Webuye District.  She is pictured here in a group of 10 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 87 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Margaret has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nMargaret is married and has 7 children.  She is 57 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Margaret has been a farmer for 30 years.  Margaret described her harvest as excellent last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMargaret first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Margaret joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and as an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nMargaret and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

For the past two years, Ramulah has been working hard to manage her tailoring business, which designs clothes. \n\nTo help expand her business, Ramulah has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more material and it will help Ramulah generate greater profits, which she will use to pay her school fees.  Ramulah hopes that in the future she will be able to open a boutique. \n\nRamulah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Kiva representative.  Metrine has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 90 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMetrine is married and has 4 children.  She is 43-years-old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Metrine has been a farmer for fifteen years.  Metrine described her harvest as poor last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nMetrine first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Metrine joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer, hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and as an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Metrine plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Metrine\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n \r\nMetrine and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":1489451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T01:30:05Z","loan_amount":5575,"lender_count":176,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":481410,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481410}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5575,"local_amount":481410,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":483352.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722875}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T19:35:06Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":656455,"name":"Saroeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saroeun is 29 years old.

This will allow her to finish her production on time and turn over the orders to her customers in a timely manner, thus succeeding in acquiring new contracts to continue generating income for her family and to reinvest capital in her business, since she wants to achieve her dream of having her own line of production of uniforms, guaranteeing a better profitability to offer better living conditions to her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1509855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies wholesale (fabrics, thread, buttons, fasteners, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sabaneta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-13T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Alba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":71404},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":73379},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75408},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":77494},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":79638},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":81841},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":84104},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":86431},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":88822},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":91279},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":93803},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":96397}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.01,"local_amount":144783,"processed_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":146245.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459524036},{"amount":40.42,"local_amount":76993,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":77770.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227666},{"amount":40.07,"local_amount":76327,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":77097.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245298},{"amount":368.5,"local_amount":701897,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":708986.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856044}],"funded_date":"2014-01-16T05:31:13Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T14:41:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":656464,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of three children, Julieta works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business buying and selling purified water in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from selling vegetables.

Her oldest daughter is married, but the rest of her children are still in school.  Odinakhan has a high school education.  As a main source of income, Odinakhan raises livestock and grows crops, a business that she started 23 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 8,000 som (KGS).  All of her children and her spouse are involved in helping her with the farm work.  Thanks to Odinakhan's hard work, she now has three milking cows and 25 sheep.  She also has a 1.08 hectares of land where she grows corn and clover for the cattle feed as well as rice for sale.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Odinakhan turned to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to purchase a car.  The car is needed to transport harvested crops and cattle to the market for sale.  Having her own means of transport, will allow Odinakhan to save on the transporting costs and will give her the opportunity to reach her best customers.  Profits from her business, Odinakhan is planning to re-invest into her enterprise and to set some aside for her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1537.5,"image":{"id":1509054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a car so she can transport crops and cattle to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Savay village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-13T02:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T02:30:04Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":119.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Odinakhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25209.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178434},{"amount":462.98,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":25209.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":49.52,"payment_id":595435993},{"amount":442.1,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25209.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":70.4,"payment_id":681290741}],"funded_date":"2014-01-29T21:25:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victor Khangulov","image":1437106}},{"id":645057,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is 50 years old and married, with eight children.\r\n\r\nEvelyn works hard to provide for her family.

of her household, following the death of her husband.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of working in a business, she was left without a job, and due to the need to generate income to pay the family expenses, she was looking for business opportunities. Through a brother, she became involved in the production and distribution of sugar cubes. She began her business in a  town in eastern Antioquia, since the productions costs there were lower than in the city. She works every day, and her products are sold in different cafeterias, restaurants, and shops in the region.\r\n\r\nNow she is applying for the help of a loan in order to buy supplies wholesale and to pay the fees to obtain the health department registration required by the relevant authorities in order to be able to distribute her products more widely. This will allow her to strengthen her business more and have her brand name and her products become known, substantially improving their sales and the income for her family.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Dalia wants to continue working to advance her business, position her brand, and begin to distribute her products in other cities.

For more than 23 years she has been working in the field of sales. She began in a business that belonged to her mother-in-law. Later she worked as an employee in other stores. In the year 2008 with the desire to generate more income and spend more time with her family she opened a stationary shop. It also offered photocopying and fax services and she sold cosmetics and accessories. Her business was well received in the area and two years ago she added sewing services taking advantage of having studied fashion design. She sells the dresses she makes herself and also does alterations of clothing. Doing this she makes the money to help her husband with the finances of the household.  \r\n\r\nThe loan Miriam is requesting is to buy a wrapping machine (an industrial sewing machine) and supplies wholesale (fabric, thread and buttons) and stationary items (notebooks, pens, markers, Bristol board, etc.). This will allow her to continue her work and with the machine she can minimize the production time and deliver the products with a high quality finish. So she will not only increase the sales of stationary but improve her services.\r\n\r\nMiriam sees in the future the strengthening and expansion of her business generating employments opportunities. She has been well-received in the field and believes that she can improve the profitability with an expansion. She can then provide her family with a better quality of

Jessey has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative, and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 83 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan Shillings (KES).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJessey is 48 years old and has been a farmer for 26 years. Jessey works as a farmer to provide for his four children. The community and other farmers know Jessey as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community's activities, such as the savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Jessey described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJessey first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Jessey joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, and fertilizers and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed the family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Jessey plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Jessey\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nJessey and his group need the loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5125,"image":{"id":1489468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":5125,"lender_count":159,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tunai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pharis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shadrack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":443967,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443967}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5125,"local_amount":443967,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":444337.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722871}],"funded_date":"2014-02-12T02:23:39Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neda Elaidi","image":1353963}},{"id":645078,"name":"Tung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tung, 48, is married and has a daughter.

Buumarjan has a higher education, and works as a teacher in the local school.  As a qualified teacher, she enjoys respect and authority amongst the villagers.  Buumarjan's work in livestock and farming, which she began 11 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 15,000 KGS, serves as her family's major source of income.  Thanks to Buumarjan's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 2 hectares of land, on which she and her family plant beans to sell.  Her husband helps with the housework.  To limit the risk of her cattle developing disease, Buumarjan gives antibiotics to her animals 2 times per year.  Her monthly income, which comes from milk and crops, as well as her monthly salary, is 12,000 KGS.  With the goal of increasing the size of her herd, Buumarjan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows for breeding.  WIth the increased income from her loan, Buumarjan plans to continue to increase the number of cattle in her herd, and also plans to save towards her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1509090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Suluu - Maimak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-13T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T05:10:03Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":137.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buumarjan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":85000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":42500},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":42500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":821.95,"local_amount":42500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":43040.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":53.05,"payment_id":579488794},{"amount":790.45,"local_amount":42500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":43040.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":84.55,"payment_id":595435995}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T20:18:59Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":645034,"name":"Melisa's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group consists of eight group leaders of farmers in Webuye district, with Melisa selected as the Kiva representative.

She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nMelisa plans to use the money she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Melisa \u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from the harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMelisa and her group need the loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizers through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5500,"image":{"id":1489462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T05:10:03Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":196,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felistus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":476061,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476061}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5500,"local_amount":476061,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":476849.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722872}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T20:34:09Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neda Elaidi","image":1353963}},{"id":656497,"name":"Sumaira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sumaira is a 30-year-old married woman living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

Her two daughters are married, and her son and his family live with Rakhima.  Her son has four children, who help Rakhima with housework.  Rakhima has a secondary education.  Rakhima's work in animal husbandry and farming, which began 25 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 3000 KGS, serves as the major source of income for Rakhima's family.  Thanks to Rakhima's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows, and also 0.65 hectares of land, on which she raises potatoes, corn, and vegetables.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS, though her son, who is a construction worker, also contributes financially.  His income goes to his mother to help the family.  Rakhima sells potatoes, corn, and vegetables for cash, and her yearly income from crops is about 80,000 KGS.  With the goal of further increasing the size of her herd, Rakhima turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows to fatten and resell at  the market for a higher price.

He is pictured here in a group of seven One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 69 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Joseph has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet to cultivate.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\r\nJoseph is married and has seven children.  He is 52 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Joseph has been a farmer for 23 years. He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nJoseph joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  He joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, obtain fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  \r\n\r\nSince Joseph likes being a leader and an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Joseph has become more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Joseph's life because he has more profits from harvest, farm training, and farm group support. He was able to save money and feed his family.  In the future, Joseph hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, to repair the home, to save for the future, to buy a cow, and to invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJoseph and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":1489536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T05:30:03Z","loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyongesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":369081,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4275,"local_amount":369081,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":370642.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722877}],"funded_date":"2014-02-11T16:30:21Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Nicaise","image":1379391}},{"id":645088,"name":"Thao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thao, 41 years old, is married and has two sons.

Two of them are living by themselves, away from their parents.  Jiydegul has a secondary education, and works cleaning floors, windows, and walls in a school.  Jiydegul's work in animal husbandry, beginning 14 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 KGS, serves as a source of additional income for her family.  Thanks to Jiydegul's hard work, she now has in her herd 3 milk cows, 1 mare, 3 sheep, and 4 goats.  Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS.  With the goal of continuing to increase her economy, Jiydegul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase foals for breeding.  For the care of animals, she has procured 400 pieces of pressed hay, 1 ton of barley, and 1.2 hectares of land.  With the increased income from the loan, Jiydegul plans to invest in further increasing the size of her herd, and also plans to save towards construction on her unfinished

She will be using the loan to buy gardening materials like wire and baskets and supplies such as seeds and fertilizer needed in her business. The profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nCecilia dreams that her business will last longer and hopes to have better living conditions. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1370708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is pictured here in a group of seven One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 84 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Walubengo has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet to cultivate.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nWalubengo is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 27 years.  She works as a farmer to provide for her seven children. The community and other farmers know Walubengo as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  In addition to farming, she is also involved in community groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Walubengo described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nWalubengo joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling for the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  She joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, obtain fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  Because she likes being a leader and an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Walubengo has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Walubengo's life because she has more profits from harvest, farm training, and farm group support. She was able to save money and feed her family.  In the future, Walubengo hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, to repair the home, to save for the future, and to buy a cow.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

The members have different businesses and are merchants, provide services, and do other activities.  A short time ago they decided to join the institution so they can get loans.\r\n\r\nRita is one of the members.  She is 45 years old, married, and has an eight year old son who attends a local school.  Her husband is a retired police officer.\r\n\r\nRita used the money from the first loan to start her business.  She built a small farm where she raises chickens.  She began with very little and increased her number of chickens over the following days and months.  She buys them small, raises them for two or three months and then sells them by the pound or whole to area residents or to merchants who sell them in other areas.  She has been doing this for two months and it allows her to earn money without having to leave home.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy feed and medicine for her chickens.

He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nCharles joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family. Charles also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers. Charles is also involved in the community's peace coordination. Charles plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school and invest in a business. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from the harvest, was able to save money, and feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nCharles and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T06:30:07Z","loan_amount":5625,"lender_count":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clementina","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Scolastic","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nashion ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sussy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shem","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monicah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":486759,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":486759}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Narindra-Dastoor","image":153719}},{"id":645100,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A $1,000 loan was given to Maria to improve her business.

Edward has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 65 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\r\n\r\nEdward is 48 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years.  Edward works as a farmer to provide for his six children.  The community and other farmers know Edward as hardworking, reliable and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group and savings group.  Edward described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEdward joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Edward joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices and send his children to school.  Because he is an active community member, Edward has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Edward's life because he has more farm training and is able to feed the family.  In the future, Edward hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and buy a cow.  \r\n\r\nEdward and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

He wants his clients to be pleased with his lemons.\r\n\r\nAlijon prepared and planted a crop in time for the onset of winter.  However, the crop needs to be saved because the roof of the hothouse is in dire need of repair.  The roof needs repairs very badly.  Alijon is requesting a loan to buy fittings, wire, and tenting so he can repair the roof and save his crop of lemons.  Alijon hopes that his work won't have been in vain and that he will have a harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1490222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fittings, wire, and tenting for hothouse repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vakhsh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.710833 68.831111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T09:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T09:10:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alijon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":413}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":262.71,"local_amount":1251,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459153047},{"amount":87.57,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":418.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467969218},{"amount":87.57,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":418.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479189510},{"amount":87.57,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":418.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490882906},{"amount":524.58,"local_amount":2498,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504309946}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T19:37:37Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:40:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":645109,"name":"Sokheang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokheang is 53 years old and has a family with five children.

He established a new business and hopes this business will prove more beneficial than the last one. He retained a list of good customers in a short time and this business is going well. He wants to make a further investment to complete the remaining inventories for his newly started business but he does not have enough money. Therefore, Rehana requested a loan so that her husband can buy the remaining stock for his sanitary shop. She thanks Kiva and field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

This income is hardly enough for the family to meet their basic needs, so Ketevan decided somehow to improve her salary and start another activity.\r\n\r\nShe couldn\u2019t receive a loan from the local financial institutions (because of their requirements to have business experience or stable revenue) until the Start Up program, which is a joint product of Kiva and Credo, began.
