He is pictured here in a group of 4 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 56 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Isaac has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nIsaac is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years.  Isaac works as a farmer to provide for his two children.  The community and other farmers know Isaac as friendly, hardworking and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group and prayer group. \r\n\r\nIsaac was not with One Acre Fund last year, and hopes he can have a better harvest this year with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in the group.\t\r\n\r\nIsaac has just enrolled with One Acre Fund this year and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Isaac joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  Isaac plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers and that is why he has joined them.   \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Isaac and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gentrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":299544,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":656545,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis is a 63-year-old married man.

Kaipasi has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\r\nKaipasi is 42 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years.  Kaipasi works as a farmer to provide for his 4 children.  The community and other farmers know Kaipasi as hardworking and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the prayer group.  Kaipasi described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nKaipasi joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Kaipasi joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed family.  Because he is an active community member, Kaipasi has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Kaipasi's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and was able to save money.  In the future, Kaipasi hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and invest in a business.  \t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Kaipasi and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":5125,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kaipasi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laurent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chrispinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercylyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":443967,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443967}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cheryl Strecker","image":1412668}},{"id":656537,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is a 44-year-old married woman.

56 years old, married, and is raising 4 children.  Two of her children are married and live with their own families.  Her daughter, who is in school, and her youngest son live at home.  Sveta has a secondary level education and has very good references from her neighbors.  They say that she is a decent, hard working woman.  \r\n\r\nHer family's main income is Sveta's business of selling fruit and vegetables at the local market.  She started this business in 1995.  Her inventory includes various types of grapes, apples, date plums, pomegranates, beets, onions, cabbage, tomatoes, Bulgarian peppers, and herbs.  She started her business with 3,000 som (KGS), but as a result of her hard work she has been able to develop and expand her business.  Today, it brings in about 25,000 som (KGS) per month, which is the basis for covering her family's grocery and day-to-day expenses.\r\n\r\nFor supplemental income, Sveta and her husband are also in the animal husbandry business, which she has been doing for many years.  She started this business with 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, today she has 2 milk cows, a heifer, 2 calves, and 10 sheep.  The income from her businesses allowed Sveta to expand her inventory and to buy a car.  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Sveta applied to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan with which she will buy vegetables and fruits at wholesale.

He is pictured here in a group of 7 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 75 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Bonface has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nBonface is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 5 children.  Bonface is 42 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 30 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Bonface is very active in his community and is involved in the prayer group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBonface first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Bonface joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers.  Bonface plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Bonface\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\r\n\r\nBonface and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T15:30:06Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bonface","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Titus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":401175,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cheryl Strecker","image":1412668}},{"id":645134,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva works hard to support her family.

He is pictured here in a group of 7 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 64 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Stephen has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nStephen is 70-years-old and has been a farmer for 47 years.  Stephen works as a farmer to provide for his eight children.  The community and other farmers know Stephen as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Stephen described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\r\n\r\nStephen first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Stephen joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Stephen plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Stephen\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Stephen and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase better harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T15:30:06Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Titus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Akhuyanga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":342336,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":656599,"name":"Gurgen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gurgen is a 27-year-old married man.

She lives with her husband, son and daughter-in-law, who teaches at the local village school.  Karine and her husband are involved in agriculture. They keep a livestock and also cultivate land. The gathered harvest (apricots, peaches and grapes) is sold locally and the family is able to earn an income for a living.  All family members work hard to be able to gather a good harvest and sustain their living. Now, by asking for this loan, Karine wants to purchase forage for feeding the livestock. She has taken the loan from local financial institutions before and because of financial hardships she wasn't able to pay it back on time.

She lives with her husband, father-in-law (in the photo) and her two school age children. Karine's husband is a migrant worker in a neighboring country and Karine, together with her father-in-law, has been involved in agriculture. They own a farm which includes livestock of a pig, cows and chickens and also cultivate wheat, tomatoes, sunflowers, watermelon, and greens. Karine and her father-in-low work hard to gather a good harvest and by selling it in the local open market gather income for their living.\r\n\r\nNow by applying for this loan, Karine plans to purchase a cow, a pig and forage for feeding the livestock. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, Karine and her family were able to run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the monthly payments of this loan. So, Karine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Karine hopes and waits for lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1363,"image":{"id":1510152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married and has children. He lives in Hodeida, Yemen. For the past two years, he has been driving a bus, which has been a profitable business.  It is the main source of income for the family, but he also needs more support to cover the costs from time to time.

He is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 52 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Wycliffe has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\r\nWycliffe is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 11 years.  Wycliffe works as a farmer to provide for his 5 children.  The community and other farmers know Wycliffe as an experienced and hardworking farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in community groups such as the men's group and savings group.  Wycliffe described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nWycliffe joined One Acre Fund in 2008, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund so that he could learn new farming methods.  Because he is an active community member, Wycliffe has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Wycliffe's life because he received training and was able to feed the family.  In the future, Wycliffe hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

Zurab works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize and potatoes. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. As the family has only seasonal income, Zurab decided to start dairy farming and seek credit from local financial institutions. However, his attempts to obtain credit were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Zurab's application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1500 GEL for purchasing a milk cow.  After the cow is purchased, the family will start producing dairy products, including cheese and yogurt for selling.

When she entered 10th grade she had classes in Graphic Arts, Audiovisual Media, and Science and Technology, where she learned about different kinds of photography, created web pages, studied high and low relief and the volume and shadow of objects. \r\n\r\nIn the second half of 2013 she entered university to study Graphic Arts and Advertising, learning, and putting into practice all the knowledge she is acquiring from her instructors. Currently she is ready to start the second semester of the program and is eagerly waiting to learn from her instructors. Her short-term goal is to begin the second semester at the university and continue to study Graphic Arts and Advertising.  Her medium-term goal is to graduate as a Professional Graphic Arts and Advertising technician and begin to work for a company where she can apply all the knowledge she acquired in the program.  In that way she will be able to continue to help her parents and sisters without having to interrupt her studies so she can go on to earn a professional degree. \r\n\r\nIn the long-run, Alexandra sees her own advertising company offering job opportunities to young people who have the same interest in Graphic Arts and Advertising so that they can afford to study for such a career while they are young.

That's why some people sell wherever they can, including in the streets, where they display their products on cardboard, or by going door-to-door. They make sure to start selling at around 6 a.m. and leave at around 2 p.m. so that they have time left to work on other activities.

Wycliffe has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWycliffe is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 8 children.  Wycliffe is 54 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 45 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Wycliffe is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, savings group, prayer group and the burial committee.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\r\n\r\nWycliffe first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers learn about One Acre Fund.  Wycliffe plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Wycliffe\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n  \t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Wycliffe and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase better harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T17:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T17:10:12Z","loan_amount":3525,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wycliffe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elijah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnetta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":304893,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304893}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":645166,"name":"Al-Nours Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Al-Nours is a group of five ladies from al-Hodeida, Yemen.

The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo. The group leaders in this group represent a total of 56 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Solomon is pictured on the right of the group with his hand raised.\r\n\r\nSolomon is 50 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years. He works as a farmer to provide for his 10 children. The community and other farmers know Solomon as hardworking and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community including the men's group and prayer group. Solomon described his harvest last year as poor and hopes he can have a better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nSolomon joined One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Solomon joined One Acre Fund so that he could try new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family. Because he is an active community member and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Solomon has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Solomon's life because he was able to save money and was able to feed his family. In the future, Solomon hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and save for the future.\r\n\r\nSolomon and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers with the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":1489478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T17:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T17:10:12Z","loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lukhongo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pheminus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":299544,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3450,"local_amount":299544,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":299735.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722879}],"funded_date":"2014-01-31T19:43:39Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":645170,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":288.05,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy beans, oil, flour and many other items to enlarge her stock.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"QS","country":"South Sudan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4.85 31.6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":206,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T17:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T17:10:12Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SSP","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":288.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":305.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":322.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":341.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":360.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":381.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":288.05,"local_amount":921.77,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-01T10:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":921.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449634037}],"funded_date":"2013-12-15T02:16:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":645155,"name":"Cecilia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group consists of 7 group leader farmers in Webuye District.

He is pictured here in a group of nine One Acre Fund lead farmers. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo. These group leaders represent a total of 83 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. John has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nJohn is married and has nine children. He is 57 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee. John has been a farmer for 30 years. John described his harvest as excellent last year but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nJohn first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. John joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, try new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and, as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. John plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. John\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from his harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support, and he was able to feed the family.\r\n\r\nJohn and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers with the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to access hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":4750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayeku","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":411873,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411873}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":656734,"name":"Isidora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Isidora tiene 37 a\u00f1os,es casada y tiene 2 hijos,la socia se dedica al negocio de venta de comida,la socia prepara diferentes comidas como pollo al horno,saltado decarne y sopas,la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 5:00 p.m,la socia ya tiene 5 a\u00f1os en este negocio y le va muy bien,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es tener un restaurant.La socia solicita el credito para comprar productos para cocinar como pollo,carne y verduras.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.

This will enable Irene to earn money so that she can continue her own education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1490190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To open a stall and purchase stock for it","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Hurungwe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":305,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069459},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882403},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479105806},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490800791},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224024}],"funded_date":"2013-12-14T20:27:50Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:50:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":645095,"name":"Dinh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dinh is 49 years old, married, and has two children.

He is pictured here with a group of 8 One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 89 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Moses has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nMoses is married and has 9 children. He is 49 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Moses has been a farmer for 16 years. Moses described his harvest as poor last year, but believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nMoses first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Moses joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund. Moses plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Moses\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from the harvests, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nMoses and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelight","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":476061,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476061}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":645200,"name":"Asiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asiya is a 46-year-old married woman, living with her six children and spouse in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.\r\nHer husband is a driver by profession and provides transportation services by using a three wheeled auto rickshaw.

She rents a table at the local flea market where she sells products such as bags, shoes, jeans, shirts, skirts, track suits and T-shirts. She has been running this business for one year and it has enabled her to support her family in the Wedza District of Zimbabwe.

She had recently graduated from school and still had not found what she was interested in, when she began to research professions.  The one she identified with quite a bit was occupational health.<br \/><br \/>When she looked up which universities offered the degree that she wanted, she realized that it was a bit expensive.  Even though her parents cover part of it, it was very expensive for her.  When she looked for information about the health management program, she got closer to what she wanted to study.  This was the first step that Milena took to begin her studies at Campo Alto.<br \/><br \/>When she finished her semester, the significant parts of the program that she saw were that from the administrative standpoint, she can help patients with just an order or simply providing attention and answers that the user is looking for.  Although she couldn't cover everything, she tried to cover a significant part.  <br \/><br \/>With this, she has learned that when it comes to health, there is a lot behind the actual medical care.

Other than farming, he is also involved in his community though groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee.<br \/><br \/>Moses described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.<br \/><br \/>Moses joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Moses joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods,  get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed family.  Because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Moses has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Moses's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed his family.  In the future, Moses hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a goat and invest in a business.<br \/><br \/>Moses and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.<br \/><br \/>One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.<br \/><br \/>The field officer is also included in the

Athanas has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 61 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAthanas is 53 years old, and he has been a farmer for 16 years.  Athanas works as a farmer to provide for his five children.  The community and other farmers know Athanas as friendly and hard-working.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the prayer group and burial committee.  \r\n\r\nAthanas described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAthanas first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Athanas joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  \r\n\r\nAthanas plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Athanas\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and was able to save money.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAthanas and the Burudika Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

Daniel joined to learn new farming methods. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to spread the word about the One Acre Fund. Daniel plans to use the money he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and to invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has many benefits. Daniel\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training.  \t\t\r\n\r\nDaniel and the Imara Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of buying the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the savings on to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they repay the One Acre Fund.

Transporting this raw material is particularly taxing for him considering is age and health.

He is from a village in the Yavan district.  Bozor is a married man and father.  Bozor lived his whole life honestly.  He fed his family with honestly earned work.  Now he was left without work, and his source of income is gone.  Bozor is not planning to retreat and give up; he decided to start his own business in animal husbandry.  Bozor plans to raise cattle at home.  He has a cowshed.  Bozor planned everything out.

He is pictured here in a group of 8 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 89 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Michael has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving seed for one quarter acre of maize and seed for one quarter acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of KES 5,349 for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMichael is married and has two children.  He is 39 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Michael has been a farmer for 15 years.  Michael described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMichael first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Michael joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds,  earn enough to feed family and  send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  As an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Michael plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Michael\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMichael and his group need a loan to cover for the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T22:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T22:10:18Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janerose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":476061,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476061}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":645281,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to increase her current inventory levels, hence allowing her to sell greater quantities of her charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T22:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T09:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":257.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440341389},{"amount":40.6,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:07:38Z","rounded_local_amount":257.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450236910}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T16:42:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maureen Wharton","image":null}},{"id":646077,"name":"Hermes Felipe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hermes tiene la edad de 42 a\u00f1os, es padre de tres hijos todos estudiantes, siendo el mayor de 17 a\u00f1os, habita junto a su esposa e hijos en un barrio capitalino, actualmente solo  el trabaja para mantener los gastos del hogar y de la familia, pues a su esposa se le ha hecho dif\u00edcil encontrar un empleo, pero gracias  al trabajo de taxi y el alquiler de cuartos que realiza Hermes, la familia puede contar con ingresos para los gastos principales.

Francis has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative, and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 70 other individual farmers represented by this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFrancis is married, and has 16 children.  He is 53 years old, and is known as friendly and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and burial committee.  Francis has been a farmer for 32 years.  Francis described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFrancis first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season.  Francis joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\n Francis plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Francis\u2019s own life was improved because he had more profits from his harvest, and was able to save money.\t\r\n\r\nFrancis and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included

Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nLevi is married and has 6 children. He is 61 years old and is known as friendly and trustworthy. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and prayer group. Levi has been a farmer for 23 years. He described his harvest as poor last year, but believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nLevi first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2008 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Levi joined One Acre Fund in order to learn new farming methods. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and wants to help more farmers. Levi plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Levi\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\r\n\r\nLevi and the Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Levi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":369081,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":646138,"name":"Jacinto  Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jacinto radica en Santo Domingo de los Colorados, zona c\u00e1lida h\u00fameda y conocida en el pa\u00eds por la etnia Ts\u00e1chila que habita en el sector.

He has worked from the time he was a child, and his father also had this type of business. As Rigoberto grew up he learned the business little by little.\r\n\r\nHe used to go to sell milk in the areas surrounding the city.  Currently he has a business that is more practical and allows him to be closer to his family.  Above all, it has brought income to his household.

In the region where she comes from, many people live in rural areas where they don't have access to electricity.  This is a common situation in Tanzania, where the national grid reaches only 14% of the population: that means 38 million people are without electricity.  Jane knows that solar power can be an affordable and efficient solution to get access to energy.  \n\nThe impact that solar power can have is huge and varied: with solar products the people of Mbeya will be able to light their homes at night; to charge their mobile phones for free in their own home; to keep businesses running after sunset; and their children will be able to study in the evening without having to use harmful kerosene lamps.  As of today all of this is impossible, as people have to walk, sometimes for hours, just to charge their phone, and pay for it as well.  After sunset there is no light if not that provided by kerosene, which is dangerous for people's health, especially children, and for the environment. \n\nJane's objective is to use a Kiva loan to start her own business and provide solar power products to the people in her community.  Part of the loan will go towards the purchase of products.  The rest will be used to cover the costs of running the business, such as transportation and marketing.  Eventually, Jane wants to set up a solar shop in her hometown.  \n\nAs a university graduate who has already gained retail experience in the renewable energy sector, Jane understands very well how to run a business, to keep track of her revenues and expenses, and to reach out to customers.  She has been working with African Solar Rise for over 3 months now, and has demonstrated her reliability and motivation.  She has already brought power to many families, teaching them how to use the products and installing them herself on the roofs of the houses.  Jane has received training within the Solar Village project of African Solar Rise, and she therefore has the technical knowledge of solar power products needed to install them and to provide after-sales services to a high standard.  With all of these assets, she is confident she can run her activity successfully, and maintain a high level of sales.\n\nA Kiva loan will give Jane the opportunity to start a new stage in her life, and to have a truly significant impact on her community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8000,"image":{"id":1507888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy solar products and establish her own solar business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":309,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":8000,"lender_count":245,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":8000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":8000,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636787874}],"funded_date":"2014-01-14T16:42:23Z","paid_date":"2015-04-19T11:00:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":656859,"name":"Makerita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Makerita is a 23-year-old married woman who has one child.

She presented her project proposal to Paglaum MPC to finance the project and has applied for a loan of  50,000 Philippines Pesos (PHP) to purchase piglets to raise.

Gerald has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 58 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGerald is 50 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years. Gerald works as a farmer to provide for his six children. The community and other farmers know Gerald as friendly and hardworking. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community, such as in the men's group and the savings group.  Gerald described his harvest last year as good, but he hopes that he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGerald first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Gerald joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and wants to help more farmers. Gerald plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Gerald\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest and was able to save money. \r\n\r\nGerald and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

These small, yet nimble motorcycles were often used to navigate the narrow streets and alleyways of Europeans cities. Though the motorcycles were beat up, Michel quickly saw that with a little tender love and care, these old eyesores could be restored and sold as classic beauties.\r\n\r\nThe entire restoration process of chroming parts, leather-working and engine construction takes as long as eighty hours per vehicle. Michel is able to complete two motorcycles restorations per month, doing all of the work by hand. \r\n\r\nMichel\u2019s venture has not been without its challenges.

She is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 56 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Margaret has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMargaret is married and has two children.  She is 45 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable and trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and savings group.  Margaret has been a farmer for 22 years.  Margaret described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMargaret first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Margaret joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and send children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers.  Margaret plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school and save for the future.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training, able to save money and feed the family. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMargaret and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

Janepher has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 96 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJanepher is married and has five children. She is 39 years old and is known as hardworking. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, and she is also a community health worker. Janepher has been a farmer for 10 years.  Janepher described her harvest as poor last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre fund.  Janepher\u2019s life has improved because she bought a cow.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJanepher first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2007 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Janepher joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and new farming methods.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and  spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Janepher plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Janepher\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, and was able to save money.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nJanepher and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to have access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janepher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elphas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":513504,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513504}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":656883,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma operates a retail business selling homemade products in her village to make a living.

This motivated her to launch her own janitorial service, Cleaning San Diego, an eco-friendly cleaning service where customer satisfaction is top priority.\r\n\r\nSince starting, Sofia has experienced steady growth in her business, and although she admits to having growing pains with budgeting for equipment, she is optimistic that her uniquely green cleaning service will ultimately be a success. She said, \u201cI love helping promote going green and cleanliness in the community.\u201d \r\n\r\nSofia is also a graduate of the Accion Academy for Entrepreneurial Success, an 8-week entrepreneurship course that walks students from business plan to launch. Upon successful completion of the course, students receive a business loan of up to $5,000. Sofia is confident that the academy has given her the boost needed to make her start-up a success.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Kiva lenders, Sofia will use her $2,500 Kiva loan to purchase additional cleaning equipment that will enable her to service larger spaces.

Working with One Acre Fund has improved Dickson's life because he has more profits from harvest and has more farm training. He was able to save money and feed the family.  In the future, Dickson hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and invest in a business.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.

All of her children are independent, married, and live on their own except for the youngest, who lives with Kaiyrkul and helps around the house. Kaiyrkul has a high school education and earns her living raising farm animals, which she began 13 years ago when she purchased cattle for 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Kaiyrkul now has 3 dairy cows, 12 sheep, 23 goats, and a one hectare plot for growing hay. It is a good farm with the right conditions for livestock. She earns a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS). In order to develop her farm, Kaiyrkul asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase calves for fattening and resale.
