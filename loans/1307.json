They have seven children. The four oldest daughters are married. The rest are in school. Jamila has a very big family; the kids are growing up hardworking, intelligent and obedient. Jamila is proud of her children; her husband and children all help with the housework.\r\n\r\nJamila has a high school education. Her main income for the family comes from managing livestock and agriculture. She started 12 years ago by buying cattle for 10,000 KGS. With hard work Jamila now has three dairy cows, three calves, 12 sheep, 13 goats and a small plot of land to grow corn and clover for their livestock.

the Kiva representative. Jamin has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 52 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. Jamin also joined One Acre Fund because he makes his payments in installments.  <br \/><br \/>Jamin is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with five children. Jamin is 53 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 35 years to support his family. In addition to this, he is very active in his community and is involved in the burial committee.  He described his harvest last year as good. He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages. <br \/><br \/>Jamin first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2007 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Jamin joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and wants to help more farmers. Jamin plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Jamin\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and was able to save money. Jamin\u2019s life has also improved because he has planted trees.   <br \/><br \/>Jamin and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

She has completely repaid the past loans, which have enabled her family to buy a plot of farmland. With this loan, she is planning to use the proceeds to plow the field. She hopes to make more crops and to sell them for a good price.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":468.75,"image":{"id":1510585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to plow the field","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T05:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T05:50:08Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":625300.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504421394},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":625300.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595342951},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":625300.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681551634}],"funded_date":"2014-01-14T16:39:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pippa Gawley","image":null}},{"id":656916,"name":"Sreytouch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sreytouch, 22, is single and lives in a village of the Stoeng Meanchey district.

He is pictured here in a group of eight One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 97 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Lucas has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. <br \/><br \/>Lucas is married and has eight children. He is 50 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking and experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group and prayer group. Lucas has been a farmer for 29 years. He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.   <br \/><br \/>Lucas first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Lucas joined One Acre Fund in order to earn enough to feed family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers. Lucas plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and repair the home. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Lucas\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and was able to feed the family.<br \/>   <br \/>Lucas and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.<br \/><br \/>The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5975,"image":{"id":1490248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum. .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":5975,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilberforce","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":518853,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518853}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5975,"local_amount":518853,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":519107.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722887}],"funded_date":"2014-02-13T02:33:27Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":646175,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":120.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":124.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":129.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":147.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T11:59:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 71 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Electine is pictured on the right of the group with her hand raised.\t\r\n\r\nElectine is a reliable member of the community. She is married with 6 children. Electine is 72 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 20 years to support her family.  In addition to this, Electine is very active in her community and is involved in the prayer group. She described her harvest last year as good. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nElectine first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Electine joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and get the best seed prices. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member and wants to help more farmers. Electine plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school and repair the home. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Electine\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest and was able to save money. Electine\u2019s life has also improved because she was able to pay school fees.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nElectine and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the eeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

He is pictured here in a group of three One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 34 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Mark has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of KSH 5,349 for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMark is not married and has no children. He is 20 years old and is known as hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group and prayer group. Mark has been a farmer for 5 years. Mark said his harvest was not with One Acre Fund last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMark is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season. Mark joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed his family. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers, and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Mark plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to save for the future and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nMark and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1490134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer \t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T09:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T09:30:03Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Austine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":181866,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181866}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2100,"local_amount":181866,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":182447.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722891}],"funded_date":"2014-02-09T20:39:34Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beth Rattigan","image":null}},{"id":645361,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is 36 years old, a woman, and married.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 71 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of KSH 5,349 to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Jesca is pictured on the right of the group with her hand raised.\t\r\n\r\nJesca is married and has 5 children. She is 40 years old and is known as friendly and an experienced farmer. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group. Jesca has been a farmer for 12 years. Jesca described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2013 long rains season won\u2019t be Jesca\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. She first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. As an active member in her community, Jesca also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative. Jesca plans on using future profits from the harvest to buy a cow and invest in a business. Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has been able to save money and feed the family. Jesca also joined One Acre Fund because of early planting.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJesca and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1490236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T09:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T09:50:03Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gideon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milcah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":379779,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4375,"local_amount":379779,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":380099.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722892}],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T20:01:16Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beth Rattigan","image":null}},{"id":645366,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase increased amounts of soya beans and porridge ingredients, thus aiding her to improve her overall sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T09:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":128.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440341405},{"amount":20.3,"local_amount":118,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":121.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450236926}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T06:23:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beth Rattigan","image":null}},{"id":645368,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to help her purchase large quantities of watermelon for resale.

His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he was able to feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWilliam and his group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.

He has owned a grocery store since 2005.

Wilson, pictured on the right with his hand raised, volunteered and was selected to be the Kiva group representative. The field officer, also included in the photo, is standing on the left. The individual farmers represented by the group leaders are not pictured here.\r\n\r\nFarming inputs will be delivered to Wilson and the 74 other individual farmers represented by this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant a quarter acre of maize and a quarter acre of millet or sorghum. Each farmer will receive an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings.\r\n\r\nWilson, 50, has been a farmer for 22 years. He is married and has five children. He is known as hardworking and as an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in such organizations as the savings group and prayer group. He describes his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\r\n\r\nWilson joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the long rains 2014 season. He joined One Acre Fund to learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed the family. Because he is an active community member, Wilson has become more involved with the organization as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved his life because he has more farm training and is able to feed his family. He hopes his profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.

Ava's literal meaning is yellow colour. The group called themselves Ava because yellow colour is the primary colour in their traditional attire. The group is formed by 15 hardworking women who live in the same village, which is about 30 kms from Imphal town in Manipur, which is one of the northeastern states in India.\r\n\r\nReinai runs a cosmetic shop on the main national highway connecting the state and the neighbouring state. The shop is located close to the village where Reinai lives. She opens the shop early in the morning and closes down in the afternoon. She sells talcum powder, sunscreen lotion, shampoo, night creams, small sachet shampoo and other cosmetic products. The shop is close to a college where young girls come for classes and usually purchase cosmetics from the shop. Most of her customers are college girls and young lasses from neighbouring villages. She usually gets the supplies from the capital market and sells them at a little higher price for profit. The generated income is insufficient to support the family because she needs to pay the tax for renting the shop and also purchase supplies for the shop.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will purchase more cosmetic products like good quality foundation cream and other winter creams and moisturisers. She usually purchases cosmetic products with the seasonal change. Reinai says that she will repay the loan on time and will try to manage savings by opening a savings account once she purchases stocks for the shop and sells them out successfully.\r\n\r\nShe says, \u201cThank-you so much, Kiva.\u201d She will always remain grateful for the wonderful help that Kiva has shown towards her and the group.\r\nThe rest of the members are engaged in weaving, piggery, poultry and other businesses\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1510705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more stocks of cosmetics for the shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T15:30:39Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T15:30:39Z","loan_amount":3675,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chasii","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ashi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rune","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seirou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irish","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lounirou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reinai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seiru","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":225000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":225000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-30T13:43:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":645405,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to increase her current inventory levels, hence allowing her to sell greater quantities of porridge and bread.

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\r\n\r\nNahshon is 60 years old and has been a farmer for 35 years.  Nahshon works as a farmer to provide for his seven children.  The community and other farmers know Nahshon as trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group and prayer group.  Nahshon described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\r\n\r\nNahshon joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and he is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Nahshon joined One Acre Fund so that he could get new farming methods.  Nahshon wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers because he is an active community member.  Nahshon has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Nahshon's life because he was able to save money.  In the future, Nahshon hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to save for the future.\r\n  \r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Nahshon and the Jamii Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nahshon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jotham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alphonce","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arnold","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":353034,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353034}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":645407,"name":"Ngoc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngoc is 42 years old, is married, and has two sons.

He lives with his mother. \r\n\r\nEdgar became the only bread winner in his family after his father died, and he does his best to provide minimum living conditions for his mother and brother. They own a plot of land, the harvest of which (nut trees) is very small and it is just enough for their family's use. They also have a small farm with three cows, two pigs and 10 chickens. \r\n\r\nEdgar successfully runs his small farm with the help of his mother, who helps him very much. Edgar feels very responsible to take care of their farm and living conditions and he has decided to ask for a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase oxen and forage for feeding the livestock. \r\n\r\nEdgar took a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to hard work during recent times, he was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So Edgar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

This is 43-year-old Abigail from Mutare. She is married with three children, all of whom are attending school.  Abigail runs an agriculture related business (poultry) rearing broiler chickens. The business has been in operation for three years. She says the main challenges faced are the shortage of day-old chicks and feed due to high demand. \r\n\r\nAbigail has requested a loan of $600 to buy day-old chicks and feed for her poultry business. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will be channeled towards payment of her children's school fees and in turn will improve the family's general welfare. In the future Abigail plans to produce layers and venture into starting a piggery.

Josephine is standing on the right with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to Josephine and the 69 other individual One Acre Fund farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here, but they will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings (KES) for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nJosphine is a reliable member of the community. She is married with six children. Josphine is 47 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 26 years to support her family. In addition to this, Josphine is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group and burial committees. She described her harvest last year as good. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund to enjoy the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\r\nJosphine joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and is now enrolling in the 2014 Long Rains season as a group leader. Josphine joined One Acre Fund so that she could learn new farming methods. Because she is an active community member, Josphine has become more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.\r\n\r\nWorking with One Acre Fund has improved Josphine's life because she has more farm training, and has been able to save money to feed her family. In the future, Josphine hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. \r\n\r\nJosphine and the Imani Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":1490058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and hybrid seeds of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathews","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elimina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clermentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":369081,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4250,"local_amount":369081,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":369239.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722897}],"funded_date":"2014-01-25T14:41:58Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":657046,"name":"Jackline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackline is a 22-year-old, married woman.

She belongs to Volcanes de Coronel Communal Bank, the members of which have a variety of businesses, including selling glasses, jewelry, selling new and used clothing, selling vegetables, and selling cosmetics.\r\n\r\nNolvia has had her business for two years.  She sells homemade jam and whole wheat  bread, and recently started catering.  Her aunt taught her to make jam and bread a long time ago.  Nolvia also sells lunch to teachers during the school year, which helps her finances.\r\n\r\nNolvia's big challenge now is being able to firm up her dream of having all her catering supplies: dinnerware, silverware, nice tablecloths, and glassware.  It's challenging because she has just begun and it's going fairly well for her.\r\n\r\nNolvia will use the money she's requesting to buy jam jars and everything she needs to firm up her catering plans.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about participating in Fondo Esperanza is the meetings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1510923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy supplies, jars, and tableware","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Lota","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Nolvia Eledia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jonathan Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Audilia Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sergio Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Natalia Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carmen De Las Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fabiola Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jacqueline Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Delfin Natalio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Miriam Lisbet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Frida Gisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eduardo Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Daniel Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mario Hernan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ricardo Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1666706,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":113285},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":114150},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":115019},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":115888},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":116758},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117654},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":118542},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":119442},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":120346},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":121261},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":122179},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":123110},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":124044},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":125028}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.99},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1095.54,"local_amount":575100,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-18T10:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":577237.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449634302},{"amount":971.24,"local_amount":509848,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-29T08:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":511743.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459325063},{"amount":1108.22,"local_amount":581264,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":583424.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468210984}],"funded_date":"2014-01-14T19:18:38Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T11:09:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":657073,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 35 years old, from Naivasha and he is married.

Together with his family, Davit has been involved in agriculture. They keep livestock (pigs, chickens, and turkeys) and cultivate different types of fruits and vegetables (corn, potatoes, greens, plums, apples, and pears). The whole family works hard to gather a good harvest and sell it locally. Davit's sister-in-law works at local village school but her salary as a teacher is too low for sustaining the family's living. So realizing the importance of agricultural income for his family, Davit would like to enlarge it. He asks for this loan to purchase two more pigs and forage for feeding the livestock.\r\n\r\nAs this is Davit's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who did not have access to credit products before because they have no credit history.

He lives with his sister and mother, who is disabled and gets an invalid pension of 150 GEL monthly. Mukhran is a really hard-working man and is highly involved in agricultural activities. He has one milk cow and a small part of its production is sold locally. He also takes care of cattle. The family belongs to the poor category, as they don't have any significant income to meet their basic needs. \r\n\r\nMukhran's credit requests were rejected several times, as he was unable to satisfy their requirements. He received this credit in the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo - the Start-Up Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With this loan of 2,000 GEL, Mukhran will open a metal workshop, buy all the needed tools and equipment, and get private orders. Mukhran thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is in a great location and it's the only business of this kind in the area. After the metal workshop is opened, the family will have a stable income which enables them to cover everyday costs as well as expand the business in the future. With the support of the Start-Up Program, Mukhran will get the opportunity to be involved in his own business and tackle his financial difficulties.

daughters and mother-in-law, who gets monthly assistance from local government. Mzia's husband is an artisan and also gets a veteran's pension, which brings in 350 GEL per month. The family grows crops and raises goats and cattle, but its income isn't enough to meet all basic needs. That is why Mzia decided to start her own business and is requesting a loan for 1,900 GEL to buy silver jewelry at wholesale prices to resell in retail markets. Her loan was submitted under a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo which allows people to start or re-start businesses. It is obvious that the family's financial needs are significant, but Mzia and her husband work hard to meet them and give their children a better life. She is grateful for your support.

For tackling financial hardships she has also been  involved in agriculture for six years. She keeps livestock of 10 pigs, 20 chickens, and seven cows. She makes different agricultural products and sells them to local retailers. \r\n\r\nTo enlarge her business and improve her farm Shahane requested a loan from SEF International, which she will use to purchase two cows and renovate the barn. She had already taken a loan from a local financial institution, but was unable to pay it back. Thanks to recent hard work, Shahane and her husband were able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the monthly payments. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit

She is pictured here in a group of seven One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 70 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Nancy has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for a quarter acre of maize and a quarter acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNancy is 44 years old and has been a farmer for 23 years. She works as a farmer to provide for her five children. The community and other farmers know Nancy as friendly, hard-working, reliable and trustworthy. Other than farming, she is also involved in community groups such as the women's group, savings group and prayer group. Nancy described her harvest last year as good, but she hopes to have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNancy first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Nancy joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods and obtain fertilizer and hybrid seeds. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nNancy plans to use the money she earns from her next harvest to send children to school and buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Nancy\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Nancy and the Emukaya Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":1490054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":4325,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Redson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abiud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shem","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambrose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":374430,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4325,"local_amount":374430,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":375755.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722898}],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T21:15:02Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Irwin","image":672153}},{"id":646268,"name":"Nelson Ivan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelson de 28 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta 9 grado, es soltero, con \u00e9l vive su mam\u00e1 y 2 hermanos, de \u00e9l depende solo su mam\u00e1. \n\nEl cliente se dedica a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda  desde hace 18 a\u00f1os, sus cultivos se encuentran a media hora de su casa, \u00e9l viaja a pie y con \u00e9l se involucran  sus dos hermanos que le ayudan en sus negocios. \n\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo lo utilizara para comprar ganado y otra parte para sacar la cosecha de ma\u00edz.

She is married and she and her husband have 9 children. Theirs is the largest and most respected family in the village. All their children are married and live their own independent lives with their own families. The youngest son, who is also married and has three children, still lives with Toktosun. Toktosun has devoted her whole life to children.\r\n\r\nToktosun has high-school level education and, as the main source of income for her family, she rears cattle, having started 23 years ago when she purchased  livestock for 10,000 Kyrgyz Soms. Thanks to Toktosun's hard work, she currently has 7 dairy cows, 41 sheep, 3 goats and 7 horses on her farm. In the past, she has used her income from her farming to pay for her sons' weddings and give her daughter away to be married with a dowry. Her monthly income is 15,000 soms. With the aim of further developing her farm, Toktosun came to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to help her buy two bull-calves, which will increase the quantity of her livestock. She would use the income gained from the loan to further increase her numbers of livestock and plans to save money to build new accommodation for the livestock.

This place is known for its beautiful scenery, its forests, a variety of wildlife, and its kind and hardworking people who devote themselves to agriculture and livestock.\r\n\r\nThis is where Cruz, age 47, lives.  She is married, and they have four adult children.  A daughter, who is studying nursing, lives with them.  Her husband is a public employee.\r\n\r\nCruz is a housewife.  In order to get her own resources with which to help her husband with the household expenses, she sells Herbalife brand natural products.  The way she sells is to go visit her customers.  Because these treatments are continual, her products are sold very rapidly.  They are very good, and the prices are reasonable.  Also, she gives her customers payment accommodations, which is why she has a lot of customers.  She has been in this business for one year.  A daughter, who had years in these sales, gave her the business and her customers.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy natural products.  She has been in her communal bank for six years.  She likes it because the loans help her a lot.  Her dream is to get ahead in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1491667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy natural products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"24 de Mayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cruz Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1085.05,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":90.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":90.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730435},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636516},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102874},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467917752},{"amount":275,"local_amount":271.26,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138571},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":180.85,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832529}],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T22:59:26Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T13:04:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":645492,"name":"Hrayr","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hrayr is an experienced farmer, from Shirak village in Shirak region. He lives with his wife, son, and elderly, pensioner mother. Hrayr is employed in the government sector; he works at the village local self-governance body. He is the main breadwinner of the family. His salary, however, is so low that he cannot afford a living based on that alone. With the help of his family members, Hrayr is also engaged in cattle breeding, in aviculture, and in cultivation of wheat, potatoes, and apples. His son helps him sell the agricultural products in the local market. This is a very important source of income for them.<br \/><br \/>To continue running his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Hrayr needs a loan of USD 2600. He will use the loan to purchase fertilizer, forage for cattle, and potato seeds. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately he wasn't able to repay it back. However, thanks to hard work during more recent times, Hrayr has been able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Hrayr and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer, forage for cattle, and potato seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Shirak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hrayr","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":137.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":139.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":138.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":142.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":142.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":143.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":147.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":148.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":149.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":152.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":153.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":154.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":657104,"name":"Domine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Domine is 55 years old.

He was born and raised into a very humble peasant family, who earned their living working the fields. Henry, as a result, spent much of his youth working in agriculture and raising animals. He was happy in his work until a group of people, living on the wrong side of the law, brought an end to peace in the town. Because of this, Henry and his family - now victims of the country's armed conflict - moved to the city, . In the city, Henry lived with a friend, who taught him how to make spare parts with rubber for motorcycles. With this knowledge, Henry worked for a business for eight months, during which time he strengthened his knowledge and gained more experience. Henry worked at the business from 6am until 1.30pm and, as an alternative job, started his own business doing the same work. He did this in order to earn more to bring up and support his only son, who is eight years old.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to maintain equipment (improve the lathe by adding an axle and mandrel), to buy supplies (rubber tyres, packing bags) and to pay for leafleting. This will give Henry more drive to continue with his business and the leaflet will bring more customers. Sales and income will therefore increase.\r\n\r\nHenry's aim to expand his business, but in premises separate from his house. His business would then be easier to access for the public and he will be better known in the market. His living conditions will improve then and Henry will be more able to support his young
