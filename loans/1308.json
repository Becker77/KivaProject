She is married with two children.  In 2007, Fatmata established her plastic slippers business. She began her business because she wanted to generate a permanent source of income to support herself. She works at the business from 8:00am until 5:30pm, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase more plastic slippers and clothing material for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living and increase her business. In the future, Fatmata plans to expand her business to a higher level.

Raikul is a homemake and has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 16 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS).  Raikul's husband works as an electrician and earns a set monthly salary.  Thanks to Raikul's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow and also a 0.80 hectare land plot, where she grows beans and clover for sale. The monthly income amounts to 14,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Raikul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy another cow in order to increase livestock headcount. Raikul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her daughter's continued

","en":"Navbahor is a hardworking woman. 20 years ago she started her business of field crop cultivation. Navbahor helps her parents with growing crops and breeding livestock at their home. She especially grows vegetables and seasonal crops. \r\n\r\nNavbahor is the only breadwinner of her two children, as her husband does not work.

For more than 35 years she has worked in the field of dressmaking, a trade that she learned from her mother and her aunts, who always did this work. She obtained her work experience while working as a machine operator for different businesses, but twelve years ago, with some savings and the support of loans, she was able to buy her own machines and become independent. She set up her own workshop in the house where she lives with her husband and their two children. She works along with a cousin and a day worker from 2 to 5 am, and they resume from 10 am to 4 pm. She has the advantage of being known for the quality of her work, and this has allowed her to generate sufficient income to support the household economy.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is applying for will be destined for the wholesale purchase of fabrics, threads, and nylon. This will allow her to have sufficient supplies on hand to complete the production commissioned by third parties, and she will take advantage of the school season, in which her sales improve and as a result the income that she earns.\r\n\r\nSilvia's goal is the expansion of her workshop, in which she would be able to generate opportunities for employment, and in the near future she wants to open a store to sell products of her own designs. This will give her the potential to have greater profitability, and in this way she will continue working for the well being and the quality of life of her family group.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1511117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":" to buy fabrics, thread, and nylon wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T23:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T23:10:12Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Gladis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":93300},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95883},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98537},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101264},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104067},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106949}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.47,"local_amount":189183,"processed_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":197414.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459524053},{"amount":54.89,"local_amount":101340,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105749.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227683},{"amount":167.64,"local_amount":309477,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":322943.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245314}],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T02:08:16Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:59:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":657033,"name":"Madhuban Mahila Krushak Club Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The women of the Madhuban Mahila Krushak Club are from a small village in Odisha in the northern part of the India.

They do not have biological children. Faridakhan is a very caring mother. Faridakhan has a secondary education. The primary source of income for the family is Faridakhan's work in livestock and farming. She started this business twenty years ago when she bought 6,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Faridakhan's hard work, her farm now has a dairy cow, a horse, two calves, and 1.28 hectares of land where she grows beans and potatoes. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Faridakhan approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding. Faridakhan plans to invest profits she earns from the loan into increasing her livestock and she plans to save enough money for her girls' education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1509515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chon-Karabuura village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":32.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faridakhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200.27,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10486.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.23,"payment_id":579488800},{"amount":192.59,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10486.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.91,"payment_id":595436004}],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T01:28:13Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":645751,"name":"Armando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Armando is married and has three children.

His neighbors aren't nearly as excited; Luis Octavio lives in an urban zone and the flies and smells from the abundant manure generated daily are a local nuisance. Luis is investing in a 40 cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to treat his hog waste, resulting in multiple benefits. First off, the digester will process the waste, removing odors and resulting in a potent biofertilizer that does not attract flies. Luis Octavio will use the biofertilizer resulting from this process to help improve his crops without having to resort to expensive, fossil-fuel derived agrochemical fertilizers.

Bakhtygul has a secondary education. The primary source of income for the family is Bakhtygul's work in livestock and farming. She started this business 32 years ago when she bought 1,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Bakhtygul's hard work, her farm now has four dairy cows and four sheep. Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm,  Bakhtygul approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding. Bakhtygul plans to invest profits she earns from the loan into increasing her livestock and she plans to save enough money to raise her family's standard of living.

Her eldest daughter is married and the second daughter is a college student. Her three school-aged sons help Valentina around the farm. Valentina has a secondary education. The family's primary source of income is animal husbandry. She started this twelve 12 years ago when she bought 10,000 KGS worth of livestock. Because of Valentina's hard work, her farm now has two dairy cows, and a horse. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Valentine approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy sheep for breeding.

But they are necessary illusions because without them, there would be no way of going on,\u201d says Nengboi whose husband was murdered by miscreants in the neighboring state and his dead body never found. She is the profile member of Ruth Group and the featured borrower for the group. When her husband was alive, she used to sell charcoal and firewood in the town market on the northern side of Manipur state, which is about 35 km from the state capital. But she discontinued her charcoal selling business, as she could not leave the house for business purposes. She had to take care of the family and the kids at home. \r\n\r\nNengboi started running a grocery shop in front of her house. She sells all essential commodities like detergent soap, detergent powder, salt, toothpaste, edible oils, kerosene, onions, ginger etc. She usually gets the supplies from the nearest town market or in the capital market in Imphal. Most of the villagers buy commodities from the shop because the shop is located in the village itself and they don't have to spend extra money to go to the town market just to get a pack of salt. Because she doesn't have enough money to purchase supplies for sale, customers usually get irritated when their demands cannot be met.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase supplies from the army canteen at a low price and sell them. She is planning to open a savings account and start saving for the future. She says she will also repay the loan on time and try to expand her grocery shop. She thanks WSDS and Kiva for the generosity and love for the group members. She says, \u201cThank-You Kiva\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in raising cattle, pigs, poultry and other businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1510868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more items like edible oils and cereals to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimngah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thangbnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kainei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjanei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjoujam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":145000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":645754,"name":"Vioinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Violinda.

From the generated income, she pays the shopkeepers for the yarns and threads.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will purchase a variety of yarn and threads for weaving and weave different designs of woven products.

It seemed like a very good opportunity to her because health studies really grabbed her attention.  Her parents didn\u2019t have the kind of money that a university costs, so she would be able to put her skills into practice and earn some money to pay for her degree when she finished eleventh grade.\r\n\r\nIt was a little complicated to convince her parents because they have two other children who should also be given the chance to finish high school.  With the job that her father had, he didn\u2019t earn enough to be able to pay for all that his children needed.  In the school he would have to pay room and board, as well as other expenses.  The cost of a semester of nursing was a little bit affordable, and Juliana wanted to move ahead with this degree.  \r\n\r\nThe people from Campo Alto told Juliana\u2019s mother that the agreement would be in effect until she finished her degree, so they were going to pay monthly.  It went really well for Juliana for the three semesters that she studied.  In her third semester she did her practical training and it seemed really good to her to learn to care for someone who is sick, or for an elderly person.  When she went to sign up for her fourth semester, they told her that the payment agreement she had had was ending.\r\n\r\nIt seemed really bad to them that the agreement was ending, so a person from Campo Alto talked with them about an agreement with Kiva.  It is a little cheaper for her parents to be able to pay.  Now Juliana is 16 and she wants to make an agreement with Kiva so that her father and her mother have the ability to pay for the entire semester.  Then when she graduates and finishes eleventh grade she will have her nurse\u2019s aide qualifications.  She can help by working to pay for her degree and also contribute so that her two siblings can get ahead and make their dreams come true."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1511157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for registration for a semester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":152513.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392953},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152513.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069634},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":152513.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882578},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":152513.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201942},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":305026.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286083}],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T01:08:44Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":657072,"name":"Ann Jayaguru Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called \"Ann Jayaguru SHG\" and consists of nine members who are all females from a small village in Odisha in the eastern part of India.

Davit's wife milks the cow every day and produces dairy products, which are sold to local retailers with the harvested nuts and maize. \r\n\r\nDavit decided to start an additional business and requested a loan.

retired parents. Rafig runs an agricultural business and grows various vegetables on his own piece of land as well as in a greenhouse.  He works hard all day long to earn his living, but his existing income is not enough to cover food and everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nThat is why Rafig decided to start another business. He applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved under the startup loan program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva.

This city is known for its lovely beaches that people visit throughout the year, its unparalleled beauty, and for its many tourist attractions. \r\n\r\nLeonor lives here.  She is fifty-five years old and is a single mother to a 26-year-old daughter.  Although her daughter is engaged, she still lives with Leonor in her home.\r\n\r\nLeonor learned dressmaking techniques in a school in the city several years ago.  With the end goal being to earn her own income and to help support her family, she installed a small sewing workshop in her home fifteen years ago.  Since then, she has made a living sewing all types of clothing and sheets; these are the items that she makes and sells the most.  She works to fill the orders from her customers while also selling the sheets that she makes with her customers' taste in mind.  Her work is of the highest quality.  She works every day.  This is her only source of income, and so she relies on her sewing services to move herself and daughter ahead. \r\n\r\nShe will use this new loan to buy fabric, thread, buttons, and other sewing materials.  She has been involved with this borrowing group for one year, and she likes the help that the group members have offered her.  Her dreams are to have a larger workshop and for her daughter and family to be in good health.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1511208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, thread, buttons, and other sewing materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1512.75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":126.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":252.12,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":254.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636617},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":252.12,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":254.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102975},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":252.12,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":254.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467917853},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":378.18,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":381.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138671},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":252.12,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":254.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832597},{"amount":127.11,"local_amount":126.09,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":127.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258695}],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T17:32:25Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":645610,"name":"Debra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"When Debra\u2019s son broke his neck, she needed to find a way to earn income and afford her the flexibility to care for him.

Her children are students. Asel has a secondary education. Since her early childhood, Asel has worked with livestock and field crops. In 1995, she married Aydar and started working in livestock and agriculture together with her husband. Neighbors describe Asel as a responsible, committed and friendly person. Her husband and children help with the housework. The family is very friendly, family relations are very good. \r\n\r\nAsel provides the primary income for the family. She has been working in livestock and field crops since 1995 when she started her business with 4,000 somoni. Difficult and tough work has not been a problem for Asel. Thanks to her persistently hard work, Asel now has two dairy cows, one horse and 35 sheep on the farm. She also has a plot of land measuring five hectares, which grows beans, potatoes and perennial grasses. Her farm brings in about 7,000 somoni per month from the sale of milk, which covers the cost of food and household needs of the family.

She moved from her home town with her husband and her two children, ages 8 and 10, in search of new alternatives for getting ahead as a family.  After getting settled she started to work in a tailor shop where she gained experience and knowledge.  A while later she decided to go out on her own to generate better income and spend more time with her children.  \r\n\r\nNidia's workshop is located in the house where she lives, where she makes clothing for third parties.  For lack of a machine, however, she does only part of the production, then has to send it to another shop for the overlocking process.  This results in a notable drop in the productivity of her business.\r\n\r\nThis motivates her to request the support of the loan, with which she wants to buy the overlock machine that she needs.  With it she'll have the capacity to do the complete sewing process and increase her sales and, as a result, her profitability.\r\n\r\nNidia keeps on striving to get her business ahead because it has become her main source of income.  She dreams of making it a great tailor shop that will provide job opportunities and guarantee her a favorable economic stability to give her children a better education and quality of

Thanks to Ainur's hard work, her farming business now comprises 12 dairy cows, five horses, 30 sheep, as well as 2.76 hectares of land on which she grows potatoes and sainfoin for her own use and for resale.

Her dream is to buy a newer vehicle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1511216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to finance auto body repairs and new tires","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Del Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1085.05,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449636620},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459102978},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467917856},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138674},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832600},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":180.85,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258698}],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T13:09:40Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":656787,"name":"Augustine's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe est cr\u00e9\u00e9 depuis juin 2008.IL est compos\u00e9 de membres qui ont comme activit\u00e9 principale le petit commerce.\n\nSolange qui est \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame droite de la photo,est la responsable du groupe,elle est mari\u00e9e,est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 43 ans et m\u00e9re de 04 enfants dont 03 filles le plus \u00e2g\u00e9 a 22 ans et le plus petit a 6 ans.\n\nSon activit\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 acheter des tissus et les teindre pour les revendre,elle pratique cela depuis plus de 05 ans ce qui fait qu'elle dispose d'une bonne exp\u00e9rience pour ce type d'activit\u00e9.\n\nAvec le cr\u00e9dit,elle compte acheter 02 pi\u00e9ces  de tissus \u00e0 27000f l'unit\u00e9,des produits de teinture \u00e0 25000f.\n\nSon objectif est d'assurer les frais scolaires des enfants,leur habillement et acheter des meubles pour sa maison.","en":"This group was created in June 2008.

cheerful 24-year-old who is married and lives with his family in a small village.  To earn money for his family, Bekzod grows crops and raises livestock.

She is married and has three children, with two of them currently in school. For the past four years, Hamisi has been working hard to manage her salon, which deals in hair plaiting, weaving, and retouch. \n\nTo help expand her business, Hamisi has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to improve on the salon and buy more weaving hair, and retouch oil for the hair and will help Hamisi to generate greater profits and educate her children. Hamisi hopes that in the future she will be able to expand on the salon. \n\nHamisi is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Hamisi who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1491138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She offers various handmade artificial flowers in different colors, which are used for decorating homes and rooms. She has become well-known for providing good quality colorful flowers in her community. In order to meet the orders of her customers, she needs to purchase raw materials such as silk cloth material, glace paper and tissue paper along with packs of glues and wires. For this reason, she contacted the Kashf Foundation and has applied for a loan of PKR 20,000.  In this way, she will be able to increase her sales and profits.

For this reason, she requested a loan of 25,000 PKR (Pakistani rupees) from Kashf Foundation.

She has two sons and twin daughters, all of school age. Her husband works in construction. Gulsat has a secondary education. The primary source of income for the family is Gulsat's work in livestock and farming. She started this business nineteen years ago when she bought 7,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Gulsat's hard work, her farm now has a dairy cow, a calf, and a 1.60 hectare plot of land where she grows beans, potatoes, and corn. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Gulsat approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding. Gulsat will get milk from the cow she buys, so she is planning on getting additional income from selling milk. Gulsat plans to invest profits she makes from the loan into increasing her livestock and she plans to save enough money for her children's education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1509509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chongara village, Batken region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-15T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T14:50:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":32.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulsat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200.27,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10486.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.23,"payment_id":579488799},{"amount":192.59,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10486.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.91,"payment_id":595436003}],"funded_date":"2014-01-16T03:19:39Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":657554,"name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Mar\u00eda de 59 a\u00f1os de edad, es una persona que  estudio hasta noveno grado y es  casada su esposo se dedica a la agricultura.

It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Vilma continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 17, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nVilma dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes to have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMaileen Rose dreams that her business will last longer and hopes to have a family of her own. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week. It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1411838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
