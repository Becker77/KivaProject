Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near Tanzania. Inconsistent rains, especially recently, have made farming difficult, and the poverty rates in the county are above the Kenyan average. Beekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passion fruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies. Many farmers  in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.\r\n\r\nMohamed is married and has three children. Both he and his wife are farmers. Mohamed also works as a laboratory technician at a local high school. He and his wife are currently growing cashew nuts on their land and are excited to start beekeeping as it will give them another revenue stream to draw from. \r\n\r\nThis is Mohamed\u2019s first loan with Kiva and he plans to use the income generated by his hives to start a grocery business. In the future, Mohamed hopes to expand his apiary to twenty hives. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1487027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matuga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-16T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T16:30:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T19:08:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":646893,"name":"Felipe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Felipe es un cliente de Kubo Financiero y esta es su historia.\nSoy transportista particular empece hace 13 a\u00f1os trabaje con mi papa y entre el y yo eramos socios me case y el camion ya no daba para los gastos de ambos vendimos el camion y nos dividimos y yo me compre una camioneta, trabaje para una empresa de alimentos como transportista particular y agremiado a una linea de transporte dure 5 a\u00f1os vend\u00ed la camioneta y me compre una camioneta m\u00e1s nueva y empece a trabajar como comod\u00edn, luego vend\u00ed mi camioneta y me compre una mas nueva del a\u00f1o 2000.

She is married to a trader who earns Le 500,000 every month  and has one child aged 11 years. She has two additional dependents, who live with her because her husband brought them from their village to help with their schooling.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Marie established a business selling household utensils.  She began her business because she was not privileged to go school, and as an adult her older brother gave her some money to start selling cakes. After she got married, her husband asked her to begin selling household utensils because of the fire risk involved in baking cakes.  Working seven days a week and nine hours a day, she earns about Le 1,200,000 every month from this business. She would like to borrow Le 5,000,000, and has already received and successfully repaid two loans. She will use this new loan to buy more water containers, bathing buckets, pans, dishes and plastic bowls to sell. She hopes that this loan will allow her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 200,000.\r\n\r\nMarie used the proceeds from her last loan to pay school fees for her child, help her husband feed their family and buy some items for her home. However she was not able to invest in building a house because she was not able to save enough money to do this. In the future, Marie still plans to build her own house and educate her children to the university level. She feels good because this loan will add to her capital and help her improve her business and earn more income.

This will alleviate poverty due to the additional milk production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1483192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a zero grazing cow shed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-12-16T17:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T17:50:11Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.75,"local_amount":2207,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2219.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753709},{"amount":26.43,"local_amount":2265.34,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-27T09:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2278.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449658302},{"amount":33.43,"local_amount":2865.04,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2881.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459343638},{"amount":28.24,"local_amount":2420.92,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2434.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467944185},{"amount":48.43,"local_amount":4151.2,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4174.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479165194},{"amount":30.2,"local_amount":2588.85,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2603.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859818},{"amount":14.53,"local_amount":1245.7,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1252.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570679},{"amount":30.09,"local_amount":2578.84,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2593.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054030},{"amount":4.2,"local_amount":360,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":362.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547230},{"amount":100.75,"local_amount":9317.11,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":9369.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.95,"payment_id":696588666}],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T19:59:41Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:46:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":646904,"name":"Wilson De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wilson, a sus 33 a\u00f1os de edad, es padre de un hijo de 16 a\u00f1os y vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja.

Joseph has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 56 other individual farmers represented by this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\n\nJoseph is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with six children.  Joseph is 43 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 20 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Joseph is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, savings group and prayer group.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund due to the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nJoseph first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Joseph joined One Acre Fund in order to learn new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and wants to help more farmers.  Joseph plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Joseph\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family.\n\nJoseph's group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

She has six goats. She purchases the goat kids from the market and takes care of them. She provides vaccines and fodder for them as they require. She sells them for meat to the local butcher shops when they are grown. It takes 8-9 months for her to grow them for sale. She goes out in the morning let the goats graze in the fields and returns by noon. Then she cooks for her family.  She resumes taking care of her goats, feeding them at home. Her brother assists her in selling and maintaining these goats. In this way she is earning to control her cash flow, which however, is not sufficient to manage her daily activities.\r\n\t\r\nShe wants to enlarge her business, so she wants to purchase 10 more goats. In this way she can earn a good amount after all expenditures in her business. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 110,000 INR for her group, so that they can earn more and control their families' cash flow.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

world to a child who is parentless, says Kunjeshori, who is the profiled member for the group; she is also the featured borrower member. She is pictured with her hand raised. Prolonged ailments took away both her parents years ago and left her with no means of income.  She is unmarried but joined the women folk who formed this group to support one another in their businesses and called themselves Andro Makha Leikai SHG. The name of the group is similar to the place where the members live. It is about 35 kms from the capital town of Imphal and also one of the capital states for northeast India.\r\n\r\nBrewing is Kunjeshori's main occupation to generate income. Brewing has been their customary practice for the community and luckily she learnt how to brew wine from relatives and neighbours. The brewed wines are generally used during festivals and community rituals as part of their customary practice. She also sells them to the village and nearby villagers for more income. She says she is not able to meet the demand because she does not have enough money to buy quality rice and yeast for brewing. She usually gets an advance payment from customers, brews the wine, and supplies it. The income generated is small and insufficient for business investment and savings. It has to be shared for daily expenses, her brother's job and other necessary expenses which leaves very little for purchasing rice and yeast for brewing wine.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan, she is hopeful that she will be able to brew a large quantity of wine. The brewing supplies like rice and yeast can be brought and kept in stock with the loan, in order to generate more income. She is glad that Kiva is supporting her and the group, acknowledges their hard work, and assists them financially. She says \u201cThank you so much, Kiva\u201d and she will always remain grateful and obliged.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, brewing and piggery.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/

She also believes in the dignity of labour. She is married to a lorry driver and she also runs a variety shop in the neighbourhood. Mayai Leikai SHG Group was formed by eight hard-working women living in the same neighbourhood. All the eight women are economically active and financially independent. They all support their families by engaging in income-generating activities like weaving, tailoring and small businesses. Romila lives in a village which is about 30 kms from state capital of Manipur and also one of the North-Eastern states in India.\r\n\r\nRomila quit weaving and starting running a variety shop in the courtyard of her house, facing the roadside which connects the neighbourhoods. She sells all essential goods and daily-use items like edible oils, a variety of cereals, bar soaps, detergent powders, candles, kerosene, shampoo and locally made delicacies. Generating income by weaving was unreliable because one can only earn in accordance with the demand of the customer and capability of the weaver. Therefore she opened the shop to earn on a daily basis and generate a regular income.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva loan, she will purchase more supplies to sell.

She has already had two children and now she is expecting her third baby. Oksana's husband runs agricultural activities and generates an income of 400 GEL per month. In the early years, he was also involved in the trading business.  He was buying clothing at wholesale prices and then realized it for a good price. However, the job was hard for them as they didn't have their own place for selling the purchased clothing.  Oksana has just found the mentioned place and requested a loan for working materials. The Start Up program which is a joint product of Kiva and Credo allows the rural poor, like Oksana, to get a chance for starting or re-starting a business. She requested a loan of 2,600 USD to purchase stock of baby clothing and begin trading. This will give her a chance to earn income and become financially independent. With the Start Up program, Oksana will be able to earn savings and provide a better future for her baby."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1511547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He lives with his two school-aged sons and his wife who is a teacher and generates 200 GEL monthly. Giorgi is an experienced driver; he was working as a taxi driver with another person's car and was paying rent for the car. This money he paid was an important part of Giorgi's monthly income. Because of this he decided to apply for a loan and purchase his own car. The start-up program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enables him to get a loan of 3,300 USD for purchasing a secondhand car. He will continue his activity and will save more money, as he wouldn't have to pay the rent anymore. Giorgi is a very enthusiastic and hardworking person with a great desire to ensure his children have good education for progressing in life. This credit will be a great support for the family. Giorgi is thankful to Kiva lenders for giving him a chance to generate income.

He hopes that in the future, he will create employment and open more butcheries. This is his third loan with SMEP DTM.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a mother of two, 25 years old, and the leader of the ladies' group Chamukamuvhu. She has done farming activities on her family plot since 2008 when she was married. She mainly grew maize and some sweet potatoes that have provided the source of food for her family. However, due to inconsistent rainfall patterns over the years, the returns from the fields are dwindling annually. While she would have tried venturing into tobacco farming to get more cash, as other communal farmers are doing, she cannot. She does not have a big plot and will therefore need to embark on intensive farming. She is starting tomato farming and getting a drip irrigation kit will help her manage the water supply she gets from a nearby well. The cash generated from the tomato farming will help provide cash to purchase food for her family as well as help her purchase a variety of seedlings to increase her horticultural farming venture. She hopes to be able to raise money to get her children into school as well as build an additional bedroom for them on her homestead.  \n\nThis group comes from Goromonzi, a farming area which is close to Harare, and are venturing into horticulture as it made business sense for them.  The group is made up of members between the ages of 23 and 32, with an average age of 26 years.  After their Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Program training, they decided to carry out gardening on a commercial basis.  They have been doing their gardening since July 2013. The group members are mostly orphans and now have families of their own.  From the proceeds of their business they intend to raise an income for their families. They would like to request this loan to install a drip irrigation kit and to buy tomato and onion seedlings for their gardening venture.  The group plans to increase their farming area from 1 hectare to 5 hectares over the next 12 months.  They also want to work and ensure that all the group members have individual irrigation kits on their plots to increase their productivity rates. \n\nPENYA assists borrowers with entrepreneurial skills training through the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Program.  PENYA also helps them form Village Savings and Loans Associations, where they save proceeds from their businesses that will then become the future sources of additional loans and business investments.  Finally, PENYA carries out mentoring and monitoring visits to ensure that the businesses are being run viably.  Through linkages created with extension workers and some buyers, PENYA borrowers have access to further training in the production and selling of their produce.

It's not the most profitable field of work and Germ\u00e1n finds himself constantly looking for ways to improve his production process. His 10 cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester will allow him to do exactly that. The digester will convert some of the abundant cow manure produced everyday in his dairy into two valuable resources - renewable energy and biofertilizer. The biogas generated by the digester will allow Germ\u00e1n to reduce the amount his family currently spends on expensive and non-renewable propane to heat bathwater and cook. Germ\u00e1n will use the biofertilizer to improve his soils without having to spend more money on petroleum-based agrochemical fertilizers. The economic savings will improve the farm's business model and the environmental impact of his farm will be mitigated through both the displacement of fossil-fuel based fertilizers and fuel as well as improved treatment of the animal waste produced daily on his farm. This loan represents 46% of the total cost of his Sistema Biobolsa biodigester and biogas

Betty is a hardworking, well-liked member of the community with 9 children. Betty is 47 years old, works as a commercial farmer, and lives with her family in a house made of mud walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nKapsaoi village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a borehole. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Betty and the 34 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nBetty has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Betty volunteered to be the promoter because she wants to educate the community to use chlorine dispensers and improve people's health.

The community of Sawani village collects their drinking water from a borehole because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Sawani\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Sawani, 10 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Jonness has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Rebecca and Mercy.\n\nSawani village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Jonness believes that the dispenser will prevent sickness in her community. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.

He has worked in tailoring for 2 years, a job he learnt from his wife, who has also had her own workshop for 10 years. He provides services to third parties and also makes his own line of shirts and blouses. He usually works on his own from Monday to Saturday from 7am to 6pm, but at busy times his two daughters help him. In this way he has managed to cover the basic household costs. <br \/>The reason Hector is asking for this loan is to strengthen his business. With the money he will buy a table for cutting, shelving for storage, sewing patterns and wholesale materials including fabric, thread, buttons and fastenings. This lets him optimise his time and increase production in order to meet orders in a timely fashion. This will give him more sales and a better income to be able to provide necessities for the family. Hector says that his main dream is to succeed in dedicating himself solely to making his own line of clothing, which would be profitable and would guarantee him favourable economic stability. This would let him enjoy a better way of life together with his family, as well as securing a peaceful old-age without any money

Boniface has been a farmer for 25 years and he described his harvest as good last year, but he believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBoniface first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Boniface joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, fertilizer and hybrid seeds and to earn enough to feed his family. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers in his community. Boniface plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Boniface\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to feed the family.\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Boniface and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1485403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-16T23:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T23:50:12Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boniface","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milcah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":246054,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246054}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2850,"local_amount":246054,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":246752.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722826}],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T16:04:05Z","paid_date":"2014-12-22T10:42:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":646372,"name":"Aldarbat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aldarbat, 29 years old, lives with his wife in a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

the wave of violence caused by confrontations between gangs. Nevertheless, he gets up in the early hours every morning and goes to work at his own business, a stand where he sells fried foods. He started this some years ago as an alternative means of earning money to meet his household expenses. At his stand, he sells cakes, coffee, fried foods such as empanadas, pastries, meat pies, and donuts,  juices, sodas and more. This business earns him enough money to meet his family's daily needs.\r\n\r\nThe credit he is requesting will be used to strengthen his business and improve its image. With the money, he will buy a new warming glass case and replace the deteriorating one that he has now. He will also buy various supplies at wholesale, including vegetables, chicken, beef, sauces, coffee, soda and more.  This will help him attract new customer and offer them a variety of products that will suit the tastes of the workers, which all means more sales and more income.   Guillermo says that his age doesn't stop him from continuing to fight to meet his goals. He takes every day with more dedication and drive so that he can achieve his dream of opening a business in its own location, improving his working conditions and earning greater profits, all with the goal of improving the well being and living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1511809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy a glass warming case and food supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T00:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T00:10:07Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo Le\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":71396},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":73372},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75403},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77490},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":79635},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81839},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86433},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91284},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":93811},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96407}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76,"local_amount":144768,"processed_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":147150.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459524060},{"amount":39.63,"local_amount":75483,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":76725.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227690},{"amount":40.74,"local_amount":77597,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":78874.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245321},{"amount":41.89,"local_amount":79787,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81100.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856063},{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":82037,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83387.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282780},{"amount":283.67,"local_amount":540328,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":549220.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983144}],"funded_date":"2014-02-06T20:09:30Z","paid_date":"2014-08-30T09:12:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":657592,"name":"Huikap Awang Leikai Women Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group of seven women is best known as Huikap Awang Leikai Women SHG group. They came together to stand united for one another and formed this group. They belong to a non-tribal community, and are living here in Manipur state on the outskirts of Imphal East district, located in the northeastern part of India. \r\n\r\nThe woman pictured with a raised hand is called Thoithoi and is the profile representative of the group. She still shares the same kitchen with her in-laws, but did not get any financial support. Her husband is a seasonal farmer. In the off-season, usually, sand sieving is his way of earning income for the family. \r\n\r\nIn order to supplement their income, Thoithoi started her line of weaving activities. She uses a handloom to weave. (A sample handloom can be seen in the picture behind the members.) With her first loan, Thoithoi was able to increase her production as compared to before the loan. The cloth that she weaves includes bed covers, wrap-around skirts, and cloth usable for towels and shawls. She supplies her products at the market at reasonable rates. \r\n\r\nShe is happy that she is in good health to support the family income. With the profit that she earns, she usually puts aside some amount to deposit in the group savings on a weekly basis. In this way, every time she gets a loan, she has been able to increase her production. She has been saving most of her profits, as well as her husband's income, for a separate home very soon. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this weaving activity for the past four years now. Now she needs another loan to continue to do better with her business. She will buy materials required, such as yarn of various colours and textures, to weave wrap-around skirts, shawls, bed covers, etc. She also means to buy the finished products from other weavers to supply at the market for a profit. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members are also making steady improvement like her with their respective income-generating activities. All the members in the group are weavers.

","en":"Farida is 46 years old. She is a widow and has two children. Farida has raised her children by herself since her husband died young. After her husband died, she went to work as a janitor in a rural school. Her salary is very small and is not enough to support the family. Three months ago she started her livestock breeding business. Farida wants to expand the new business. Therefore, she studied in the course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women. She is requesting a loan of 500 TJS to buy cattle to expand her new business.

Near Yerevan town, Spartak and his family own a plot of land where they grow peach, apricot, cherry and plum trees. They also keep 2 cows and 10 turkeys. The whole family works hard to gather a good harvest and sell it. \r\n\r\nBecause of a difficult financial position, Spartak and his family are unable to improve their farm and enlarge the agribusiness.  \r\n\r\nSpartak has applied for this loan to purchase forage for feeding the livestock and fertilizer for the trees. \r\n\r\nAs this is Spartak's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. This first-chance loan program provides loans to people who did not have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. \r\n\r\nSpartak and his family will be very grateful for the support and goodwill of lenders and they hope for the loan."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1511588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for forage for the livestock and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Yerevan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Spartak","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":116},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":122},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":123},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":124},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":126},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":129},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":131},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":134},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":136},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":143}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":657539,"name":"Jamal Al-Hodeida Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group, Jamal Al-Hodeida, consists of four ladies.

She is a single mother and has three children, none of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been in the business of selling seafood for eight years now. Ever since her mother sent her out to sell and she learned how, she's been a saleswoman all her life. To buy her products, she walks from her home village some 15 minutes to catch a bus that will take her where she needs to go. The bus takes an hour and a half. She buys her merchandise, prepares it, then goes to the city where she sells her goods. She sometimes also sells from door to door in the villages near where she lives. She wakes up at 5:00am to get ready for work, leaves her house at 6:30am, and returns home again at 5:30pm. This is her daily schedule.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in her business through the purchase of 50 lbs of fish, 50 lbs of shrimp, and 25 lbs of crawfish, crabs, and more. This loan will help her by enabling her to purchase more products more cheaply, and will also mean she doesn't have to travel every single day to buy goods, which will leave her more of her income.\r\n\r\nHer dreams include building a house of brick, since the adobe one she has now doesn't work, and buying some land and leaving some of it to each of her children. With her earnings, she hopes to pay off the loan and leave the doors of the institution open to her, and also to save toward her dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1511825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"buy large quantities of fish for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda De Los \u00c1ngeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":22.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":23.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":23.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":24.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":29.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.01,"local_amount":21.01,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":21.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088553},{"amount":24.03,"local_amount":24.03,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":24.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902810},{"amount":23.68,"local_amount":23.68,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":23.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216005},{"amount":24.15,"local_amount":24.15,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":24.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817364},{"amount":24.1,"local_amount":24.1,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":24.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242819},{"amount":26.09,"local_amount":26.09,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":26.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525899},{"amount":25.62,"local_amount":25.62,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008395},{"amount":27.14,"local_amount":27.14,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":27.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500484},{"amount":28.11,"local_amount":28.11,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":28.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419341},{"amount":76.07,"local_amount":76.07,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544207}],"funded_date":"2014-01-16T15:47:49Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:31:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":646396,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a 31-year-old single woman.

She was accepted into the Universidad San Fransisco Xavier and is studying mining engineering. \r\n\r\nNow with the chance to achieve her dream, she is concerned about affording all the costs of her education. With a loan, Karen plans to buy her schoolbooks. Up until now, she has been managing to get by without them, but it has become a challenge. With books and school supplies, she feels she will be able to get better grades. \r\n\r\nShe expects to graduate in October 2014, but without a loan, is unsure how she will be able to continue affording her education. She shares that her alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until she could return. Karen shares that it is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nWith a career in mining engineering, she expects to earn $25 a day. With two older siblings attending college already, Karen is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her own without the assistance of a Vittana

Like any child her age, she sought ways to spend her free time. Her passions have always been animals, going fast, and getting to know places, which is why she wanted to be either a flight attendant or a zoologist when she grew up.\r\n\r\nShe started attending a school near her home. As she was a dedicated little girl, her principal decided to promote her from fourth to sixth grade. This complicated her life a bit as she encountered new and more difficult ideas which left her less time to spend with her friends.  When she was 11, a neighbor talked to her about the things he was doing as a member of an aid group that he belonged to, the Civil Defense. She decided to enroll, and discovered many things that she had been unaware of before. With this motivation, she continued to attend every Sunday for four years. By the age of 15, the things she was learning had started to change. She met people who taught first aid. At first, she just learned these things, but didn't pay much attention. But over time and after meeting some of her instructors who were nurses, she became enthusiastic about becoming one of them, about saving lives, and she began to feel the same dedication that they showed.\r\n\r\nHer desire to keep learning decreased her anxiety and her childhood wishes to become a flight attendant or zoologist, replaced by her wish to be a nurse and help people. She was surprised that what she learned in the Civil Defense had become the basis for choosing her current passion.\r\n\r\nAt 16, she had achieved part of her goal by graduating from high school and she started looking for a place to study nursing. She looked at various places and enrolled at Campo Alto, where she is currently studying. She is now in her third semester and is seeking support from Kiva so she can continue in her trade and in the Civil Defense.\r\n\r\nShe has decided that she would like to specialize in pediatrics and is gaining depth in her chosen profession every day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1511812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay for a semester of higher education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":145208.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392959},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":145208.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069640},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":145208.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882584},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":145208.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201948},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":290416.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286089}],"funded_date":"2014-01-16T01:59:01Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":657635,"name":"Mar\u00eda Juana Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 39 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta 4to grado de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, est\u00e1 casada; su esposo se dedica al trabajo agropecuario, pues poseen animales y a la vez siembran para alimentarlos.

The group leaders represent a total of seventy-six individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured. The field officer is also pictured and is standing on the left side of the photo.\r\n\r\nBetty and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBetty is a reliable member of the community. She is married and has four children. Betty is thirty years old and has been working as a farmer for the last twelve years to support her family. In addition to farming, Betty is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group. She described her harvest last year as good. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoy the success she is having with One Acre Fund farm packages. She volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she wants to help more farmers. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBetty first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. She joined One Acre Fund in order to be exposed to new farming methods, as well as acquire fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Betty plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has been beneficial for the farmers. Betty\u2019s own life was improved because she has received farm training, which has enable her to save money and feed her family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBetty and the Faith Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":1485609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, millet, and sorghum\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-17T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chrisantus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jostine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":406524,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406524}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4700,"local_amount":406524,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-23T10:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":406925.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722834}],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T07:25:15Z","paid_date":"2014-12-23T10:41:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Li","image":null}},{"id":646225,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de 56 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta noveno grado, esta casado, su esposa es costurera, tienen 1 hijo quien estudia el noveno grado. \n\n\u00c9l tiene 25 a\u00f1os de ser comerciante, ya que desde que dejo la escuela, acompa\u00f1aba a su padre, a comercializar granos b\u00e1sicos, y as\u00ed fu como aprendi\u00f3 el oficio de comerciante.
