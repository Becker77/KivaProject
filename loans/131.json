The children are:\r\n-\tDoni N., a 22-year-old high school graduate now attending the selection process to be in the army.\r\n-\tJackson N.,  a 20-year-old high school still looking for a job and now spending his days helping his parents on the farm.\r\n-\tMelkior N., 16 years old in the third grade of Junior High School\r\n-\tAlwi N., 9 years old in the fourth grade of Elementary School.<p>\r\n\r\nAdolof and his wife are poor farmers but they are really responsible to their children. Even though they only generate a small income from their business, they always support and encourage their children to complete their schooling. For Adolof, education is important for their future.<p>\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty that Adolof faces as a farmer is the availability of public transportation, which only operates three times a week, and the location of the market, which is situated about 37 km from Bone village, so their agricultural products cannot be sold faster. \r\n\r\nAs a father of four children, Adolof wants to improve the living standard of his family, and the cattle-fattening program seems to offer the best prospect for achieving his goal. He is therefore requesting a loan of IDR 3,400,000 to buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. The other group members of Kuanputun B1 are also requesting the same loan, also hoping to improve their lives \r\n\r\nNote: Martinus was replaced by a family member when the group picture was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":354626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bone","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-07-18T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":156,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolof","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jakson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nikolas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":50700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":4329.39,"local_amount":43900000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-22T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":44065248.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124001206},{"amount":335.31,"local_amount":3400000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3412798.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136755434},{"amount":335.3,"local_amount":3400000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-22T12:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3412798.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182619969}],"funded_date":"2009-07-22T00:56:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-22T12:14:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":127238,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cA person without a goal doesn\u2019t know his destination.\u201d This is the guiding principle of Mercedes C. who is currently residing in Inaban, Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya.

She is a mother to six; four sons and two daughters.\n She and her husband are partners in their fishing business. She has been doing it for twenty three years already and her major source of livelihood. This is her primary business. Aside from fishing, she is also doing the vegetable and dried fish vending as her secondary business. She wanted to invest more on her businesses.\nShe became of ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.) member, an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2009. When she received her first loan, she was given hope to improve her business. And now on her second loan, she proposes a loan of 10,000 PHP as additional capital for her fishing business and part will go to her secondary business. The loan will be used to pay for 1 bundle fishnet, fingerlings, and part of the amount will go to her secondary business.\nShe is hopeful that with the help of ASHI and trust of KIVA lenders, she can improve her business and can slowly reach her aspiration to get out from poverty. She also dreams of sending all of her children to school until they finish college and find jobs.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":394245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

L. farms beans and corn; he also raises cattle.  He will use this funding to buy land suitable for planting beans and corn.  He has part of the money already and the financing will make up the difference.  Yader S. L. started farming with the support of his parents, who willed him a small, 1\/2-manzana (about 0.8 acre), plot of land where he built his house and where he has lived with his wife ever since.  He began with his own efforts and financial help from Ceprodel to grow beans and corn only during the Winter.  He has always been in this line of work since he got experience in it helping his parents.  He is married and has one minor daughter; his wife helps him with his work.  He has cooperated with Ceprodel for about 4 years and the impact this has had has been very good because the loans have allowed him to buy 3 manzanas of land.  This has allowed for larger cultivation area of this basic grain that is such an integral part of our economy.

The members of this group of 7 women are engaged in many varied productive activities including: food sales, a corner store, chicken rearing, bread making, and sewing. They have formed a strong bond with one another. It is apparent that these women regard community, solidarity, and hard work as values central to their beliefs. <P>\r\n\r\nTheir special bond has developed because the members of the group have been neighbours all their lives, and thus know each other on a very deep and personal level. The positive experience that this group has had throughout the duration of their first loan has inspired new members to join the group. This will be the group's second loan with Fundacion Mujer; the first loan was paid back on time and in full. The loan officer who has been working with this group commends the members on their strong history of punctual repayments.<P>\r\n\r\nSocorro P. V. is experienced in sales. Every day, she makes \u201cpan\u201d a type of bread that she sells fresh to her neighbours and others in her community. Socorro also sews women's clothes (underwear and blouses) which she sells on the weekends in Guapiles. She travels by bus with her clothing products, taking a combination of 3 buses. Guapiles, in the Carribean region of Costa Rica, is roughly 2 hours away. Socorro has lived in Poas her entire life. At the age of 54 she is one of the eldest in the group, and she takes pride in the level of trust that has always existed in her community. \u201cThere is no trouble,\u201d she says, \u201cif anyone makes trouble it\u2019s because they come from outside of our community.\u201d Her enthusiasm for life is inspiring; she says that every day is a gift.<P>\r\n\r\nAngela R. L. is the elected president of the group. She is 57 years old and has 8 children. Angela has a business sewing and selling clothes such as pants for men and women, children\u2019s clothing, shirts, and pyjamas. She also sews quilts and other types of bedding.<P>\r\n\r\nYorleny M. P. raises chickens and then sells the eggs they lay. She is 34 years old and lives with her four children. With her first loan, she made the mistake of buying the wrong feed for her chicks, so they ended up too fat to lay eggs. As a result, she has sold these chickens and plans to use this second loan to purchase the correct feed so that she might have some chickens that lay eggs. Yorleny has thankfully maintained a good sense of humour regarding her mistake.<P>\r\n\r\nVera Maria S. Z. is 43 years old and has 3 children. She has a business preparing and selling foods to people in her community. She works out of her home Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Vera makes the majority of her sales in the afternoons and at night. She sells hamburgers, tacos, and 'ceviche' among other products. She says her tacos are the most popular item on the menu. <P>\r\n\r\nLaura Espinoza R. is 32 years old. She has one child and her highest level of formal education is the completion of primary school. Laura runs a beauty salon where she employs one other person. She will use this loan to buy hair and beauty products in order to better serve her clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":479734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

They've had the bookstore for almost 10 years and the internet access booths for 8 years, and both sides of the business do well. Elvira's husband enjoys working in sales and he is very creative. For this reason he also works as a graphic designer for various stores, using his earnings to expand his and Elvira's business.  Elvira supports her husband in all these efforts, with the hope of having their own home soon. \r\n\r\nThis is Elvira's fifth loan with MFP [the Kiva field partner], and she promises to be responsible with her repayments. She also mentions that she has found it satisfying to work with the other members of her Communal Bank. With the money from the current loan she will buy a glass shop window and replacement parts for computers, in order to increase the income from their business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":497710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of replacement parts for computers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-27T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":429},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":426}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.57},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.57},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":146.58,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993333},{"amount":146.57,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718117},{"amount":146.58,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751791},{"amount":146.57,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934253},{"amount":146.58,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673026},{"amount":146.57,"local_amount":429,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":434.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886837},{"amount":145.55,"local_amount":426,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":431.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153850}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T18:26:05Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

He is single and lives in his own house with his parents, Luis, 54, and Rosa, 45, and 2 of his 8 siblings. This family is very close; despite the fact that the children are older and independent, they help with the family finances.  When his parents gave over some land to him as part of his inheritance, he didn't hesitate and began to grow coffee and plantains. He has been doing this activity for more than a year. At times, his parents and his siblings help him, but when it's time to clear and harvest he hires laborers. Thanks to the care and techniques his father taught him, he was abe to have a harvest on the first try. Nonetheless, it has been difficult to transport the sacks of product from his filed to town. His work is very profitable, because it allows him to continue investing in his land, cover his necessities, help his family and save for new challenges in the future, like having more coffee plantings, because it is in demand. He also wants to study accounting in the city. This is his second loan with  MFP, and once again he is committed to not letting the other members of the group down, because he is happy with his community bank. With the loan he is asking for, he will buy 20 sacks of fertilizer which will protect his plantings. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":550435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy 20 sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dany ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1423,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588199}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T13:59:35Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":210036,"name":"Bashiran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bashiran is a citizen of the city called Riwind, Pakistan which is about 30km far away from the city of Lahore.

Rosa has a grocery store where she sells basic consumer products such as pasta, bread, eggs and other items that are essential in the home.  She has had this business for 5 years, and it has allowed her to improve her family's economic situation, which for a time was pretty bad because she did not have the products that people were looking for and this greatly decreased her earnings.  For this reason, Rosa requests a loan from INTEGRAL, so that she can have the money to stock her store with the products that she needs but does not have, and to increase the quantity of the products that she already has.  Rosa wants to improve her business so that she can proviD. her children with everything that they need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":618288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has lived with his wife Constantina for 30 years.  The couple have five children but only two still live with them.  They live in their own home which is located in La Esperanza neighborhood.\r\n\r\nFrancisco's aged face reflects his agricultural wisdom and experience.  He has been growing peas, corn, potatoes and beans for 35 years.  He grows these crops on his own farmland.  He tells us that the profits used to be greater years ago and so he was able to support his children and get them ahead in life.  Although it is now harder for him, he does not become discouraged as he has the knowledge he needs to produce a top-quality harvest.  In addition, he has regular customers in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma where he takes his crops to sell.\r\n\r\nAs Francisco is a country man, he owns cows, pigs and sheep which provide him with extra money as he fattens them and sells them at a good price.  Right now, this hard-working man is concentrating on his upcoming pea harvest which he hopes will make him good profits.  \r\n\r\nFrancisco is a member of the \"Punray Avanzando\" community bank.

From a young age she has been interested in income-generating activities, particularly selling grains and \"ati\u00e8k\u00e8\" (cassava- or wild yam-based semolina that restaurant owners season and sell with fish) which she has been doing for over ten years now. Following three years of partnership with Soro Yiriwaso, she received three solidarity loans (group loans) and is on her second individual loan. All of these previous loans have been properly repaid. With this loan, she intends to buy 15 bags of beans and 40 bags of ati\u00e8k\u00e8. Madame Djeneba C. gets her supply of beans from small farmers involved in this trade at weekly markets in the villages near S\u00e9gou. The ati\u00e8k\u00e8 she gets from Ivoirian wholesalers who stock traders in the main city market of Sikasso. Her customer base is made up mostly of home restaurant owners and resalers; Madame Djeneba C. sometimes sells on weekly credit, for cash, at homes and in the market on market days. Madame Djeneba C. envisions making a weekly profit of 40,000 Francs CFA that will be used to pay the interest on her loan, to contribute to her family's expenses, and the rest to invest in her business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Desde muy ni\u00f1a se ha dedicado a la crianza de animales como vacunos y ovinos, asimismo aprendi\u00f3 a elaborar queso, actividad heredada de su madre. Cada viernes a las 6.00am sale a comprar leche, ya que sus vacas no abastecen para la cantidad de pedidos que tiene y los quesos que elabora son a base de leche de corderito, y son muy solicitados ya que tienen un sabor muy natural e inconfundible. Una vez con los ingredientes b\u00e1sicos procede a colocarlos en lo horma de ichu que nos muestra en la foto, para que siga su proceso de prensado, luego los guarda en cubetas para que escurra el suero, y cada domingo los comercializa en el mercado de su localidad. Gracias a este negocio pudo educar a sus hijos, sin contar con el apoyo del padre. Victoria es una cliente muy responsable, las veces que tiene que llevar los quesos no puede asistir a las reuniones, pero deja su cuota encargada con sus vecinas o familiares para que paguen la cantidad fijada. Este es su 4to cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y durante este tiempo no ha ca\u00eddo en  morosidad. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de avena en chacras sembradas y plantas de ma\u00edz, esto le sirve para el alimento de sus vacas. ","en":"Victoria is 48 years old and has 8 children, 3 of which no longer live at home. From the time she was a little girl, she has raised animals like cows and sheep, and her mother also taught her to make cheese. Every Friday at 6 a.m. she goes to buy milk, since her cows don't produce enough for the number of orders she receives. She makes her cheeses from cow's milk, and they have a very natural and unmistakable flavor. Once she has the basic ingredients, she places them in a mold made of ichu (a grass native to the Andean altiplano), which she's displaying in the photo, so the cheese can be pressed. Then she puts them on trays so the whey can drain off. She sells them every Sunday in her town's market. Thanks to this business, she's been able to educate her children without any support from their father. Victoria is a very responsible client. When she has to transport the cheeses she can't attend meetings, but she leaves her payments with her neighbors or family members so they can pay them for her. This is her fourth loan with MFP, and she hasn't fallen into despair.

La tierra nutrida y preparada que tiene, le brinda a Celestino una deliciosa papa que luego de la cosecha es vendida y as\u00ed puede obtener ganancias y con ello logra sacar adelante a su familia. \nA \u00e9l le gusta la agricultura porque la aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres, no le dieron una profesi\u00f3n pero le dieron las herramientas necesarias para trabajar y le ense\u00f1aron como producir la tierra; adem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la crianza de ganado ovino que comercializa en los mercados de su localidad. \nEn el futuro no solo le gustar\u00eda sembrar papa, sino tambi\u00e9n hortalizas, porque sabe que debe aprovechar la tierra al m\u00e1ximo y pensar siempre en el futuro, para darles a sus hijos una buena educaci\u00f3n y ense\u00f1arles t\u00e9cnicas nuevas que les permitan sobrevivir en este mundo que crece cada d\u00eda de una manera vertiginosa.\n\nEste es el tercer pr\u00e9stamo que tiene Celestino con MFP y lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de abono, insecticidas y fertilizantes para su tierra, porque sabe que adem\u00e1s de aprovecharla debe cuidarla para seguir produciendo. Celestino pertenece a un banco comunal establecido que es muy responsable con cada uno de los pagos porque saben que solo as\u00ed todos tendr\u00e1n la oportunidad de progresar.","en":"Celestino is 53 years old, and still maintains the vitality of a youngster.  He lives with his wife (Juliana) who is 49 years old, and his two children; Katia is 19 years old, and Alexander is 8.  They are what give him the motivation to forge ahead.\r\n\r\nThis man wakes each and every day anxious to work the land that witnessed his birth, which sustained his ancestors and today continues to yield prosperous crops so that hard-working men like him can care for their families.  The nutrient-rich and prepared land provides Celestino with a delicious potato crop that he harvests and then sells to help support his family.  He enjoys farming, a vocation he learned from his parents.  They didn\u2019t provide him with a career, but gave him the necessary skills and taught him how to work the land.  In addition, he raises sheep to sell in nearby markets.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to plant not only potatoes but also vegetables.  He knows he must take advantage of the land to its fullest and always think about the future, to provide his children with good educations and the skills necessary to survive in this world that grows at a dizzying pace.\r\n\r\nThis is Celestino\u2019s third loan with MFP, and he plans to invest the funds into fertilizers and insecticides for his lands.  He knows that, in addition to enjoying the fruits of his labor, he must care for the land so it will continue to produce.  Celestino belongs to an established cooperative bank that is very responsible for all its repayments, because they know this is the only way that they will have the opportunity to advance.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":433594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase insecticides and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T14:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":504,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751223}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T14:18:02Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":160262,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita S. is a hardworking grandmother, mother, and wife.

She is forty-six years old. Cholpon and her husband have three wonderful children. Their only aim now is to give their children a proper education and help them get on their feet and bring their own dreams into reality. While their children are growing up, Cholpon and her husband are doing their best to provide them with all necessary things, whether it is food, clothes or school supplies, so that their children do not feel the need for anything. The elder daughters are college students and the younger daughter goes to school.\r\n\r\nCholpon\u2019s husband is a school teacher, and he and Cholpon keep some cattle and trade them on weekends. Cholpon has applied for this loan because she hopes to buy a calf for feeding and resale.

She is a hardworking woman who shares her life with her husband \u00c1ngel, who is 25, and their two year old daughter Luz Clarita.  For more than two years, they have leased farmland on which they grow coffee and bananas.  Judith and her husband have worked to generate more income to help cover the household expenses.  At the same time, her husband works the fields of other farmers.  He earns 20 PEN each day, but during the harvest season there is twice as much work, so Judith is also hired for this job.   What she enjoys most is living in the country since the plants and the sounds of the animals convey a peace that makes her happy.  On the flip side, she dislikes transporting her crops to the city over great distances since the sacks are heavy.  However, she says the effort is worth it.  Judith indicates the services she utilized have been quite substantial now that she has the chance to save toward the purchase of her own land in hopes of increasing production.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is assisted by her children. Mariamu has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase a machine to process traditional herbs. In the future, Mariamu plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":140704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a machine to process traditional herbs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T23:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariamu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-02T04:25:39Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199171},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226062},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255397},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":284140},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-09-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-18T07:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":314317},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345748},{"amount":39.5,"local_amount":46470.56,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:10Z","rounded_local_amount":46629.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347577},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970197},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886447},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435733}],"funded_date":"2008-03-19T04:25:39Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45330,"name":"Blanca Luz","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Blanca belongs to the community bank Mujeres Creativas 2, located at Asentamiento Human Rumbo al Futuro Mz 3 Lt.7, in the district of Manantay in the city of Ucayali.

She lives on Huandoy Alley in Huaraz Province and District in the Department of Ancash. She is a 38 year old separated mother of three children, all of whom are dependents. With her first loan of 300 soles, Amparo bought more merchandise in the form of socks. She has been working with her village bank for the past two years. \r\n\r\nAmparo is still in the same line of work, and varies the products she sells according to the season. She is currently gearing up for regional holidays in the Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas and Callej\u00f3n de los Conchudos Valleys. \r\n\r\nAmparo will use 80% of her 1700 soles loan to buy more socks and spices. She is currently in delicate health, and will use the other 20% of her loan to pay for a low-risk hernia operation. \r\n\r\nMost of her fellow group members and friends consider Amparo to be a very hard-working, enterprising woman.

Sometimes in order to reach your goal you have to put up with temporary obstacles and get used to rough conditions. However, provided that there is determination to keep going and readiness to sacrifice personal comfort, the result does not let the person down. The question is whether he or she is ready to go beyond the usual conditions and take a risk. Once they make this decision, go through this path and achieve success, their stories become models for others to follow. \r\n\r\n<p>Elmira is the leader of this group. She is 43 years old. Elmira and her family live in the city of Tokmok. Her husband manufactures metal instruments and has a monthly salary of $50. Elmira\u2019s daughter rents space in a big shop and sells bijouterie (jewelry). She manages to make $80. Elmira\u2019s son is 14 and studies in the seventh grade. Some years ago Elmira started with selling children\u2019s clothes and later on switched to trading in men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes. This business provides her with a monthly income of $350.  Elmira hopes to obtain this loan and invest the funds to increase the turnover by buying more kinds of clothes for the upcoming spring season. Her future plans are to buy a flat and provide her son with a college education. \r\n\r\nElmira\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nSaikal is 41, divorced and has two daughters. To provide for her daughters and her elderly mother, Saikal sells potatoes in the local market. She brings potatoes from another region. Saikal needs a loan to be able to bring more potatoes. \r\n\r\nKuljan is 38, divorced and has a daughter. Kuljan trades in bed clothing. She also manufactures national articles and manages to earn $160. Kuljan needs a loan as she wants to buy more bed clothing.\r\n\r\nRayimbek is 23, married and has a newborn daughter. Until now he has been trading in cattle with his brother and sharing the income. He decided to take out a loan and start his own business.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

He owns a house that has neither electricity nor piped water. \r\n\r\nPascal will use the KES 30,000 loan to purchase additional utensils, containers and kitchenware. He joined Yehu because their loans are easily accessible.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":900249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Five years ago she was faced with the problem of earning enough money to support herself and her children.  As with many women in her situation, she turned to something she knew to try and earn money. She happened to know how to make good peanut butter and so she started her small business. Her main goal was to be self reliant and to serve her customers well while earning an income to support her children.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the beginning she used the age old method of grinding the nuts using a mortar and pestle.  This method worked but it was a very slow process and she found she was not able to make the peanut butter fast enough to earn adequate money. To remedy this, she carefully planned and saved to purchase a processing machine. This enabled her to process enough to meet the de-mands of her customers and her business grew.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut her good business sense tells her that she can do more.  She now has the capability of pro-ducing large quantities but still must produce smaller batches because she has no way of storing it until it is sold.  This will require the purchase of a refrigerator which will allow her to always have a supply on hand and will also enable her to increase her number of customers.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is Anna L.. She is 22 years old, single, and has one six-month-old child. In 2003, Anna established her poultry business. She works seven days a week, and more than 16 hours a day. Anna has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase additional chickens. In the future, Anna plans to diversify her business. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":140724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional chicks to raise and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-20T08:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T19:03:54Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200099},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227093},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256333},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285074},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315267},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346840},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347583},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970203},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886453},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435738}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T19:03:54Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45346,"name":"Sara","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Sara belongs to the Banco Comunal La Familia group, located in Jr Alfonso Ugarte 449, in the district of Calleria, in the county of Ucayali.

C. belongs to the \u201cC. de Motupe II\u201d community bank. She lives on a street called Malec\u00f3n Sur (Plot 2) in the \"Asentamiento Humano Se\u00f1or de los Milagros\" zone. She is 28-years old, has a live-in partner, and is the mother of two dependent children.\r\n\r\nShe used to sell ceviche (a regional specialty) in Jr. San Crist\u00f3bal. With her first loan of 300 PEN she bought candy and soda to hand out to her customers at the \"Parada Informal\" (informal stop), a market. Later, she decided to change her line of work and sell plastic bags.\r\n \r\nMagda feels supported by Movimiento Manuela Ramos and her community bank, who supported her during very difficult moments that she went through when her husband had a construction accident and not only could no longer support his family financially but also created more expenses,  \r\n\r\nDespite everything, her strength, courage, determination helped her make it and she repaid her entire loan. With this loan of 800 PEN she will buy more plastic bags in different sizes. Today, she feels happy, confident and independent because her husband has recovered and both are again working for the well being of their family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":324579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of plastic bags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaraz - Ancash","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.533333 -77.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-05-28T08:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magda Yanett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":138.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44591096},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":138.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985382},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":132.99,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":137.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205796},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":138.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635023},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":138.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074081},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":133.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":138.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989537}],"funded_date":"2009-05-28T11:16:22Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T02:13:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":114998,"name":"Rukia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

Th\u1ecb (28) is a 46 year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1.  Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 02-\u00c1i S\u01a1n 2 (16-03-02).\n\n\nPh\u01b0\u01a1ng is married and has 2 adult -aged children.  To making a living, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting rice for sale.  Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 2000000 VND a month from these activities.\n\n\nIn 2004, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3079800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6000000 VND which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 20th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n\n1.

His children have been the reason that he tries so hard to provide them with a stable family life and an education for their future. For the past 10 years, Islom has sold foodstuff at the market. This is a profitable business in his neighborhood, and his sales have increased considerably year after year. His start-up capital was from the severance pay he received from where he used to work. To expand his business, Islom is requesting a loan of 6000 Somoni, which he intends to use to increase the range of his goods for sale. The loan will greatly improve Islom\u2019s income and his family's living standards.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Libacao, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a furniture-making business. Her husband Peter, who is 54 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have nine children who are aged between eight and 30. \r\n\r\nAndrea joined NWTF - Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF - Project Dungganon, Andrea has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock of raw materials for making furniture so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Andrea is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 42 years old. Emelita is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEmelita is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Emelita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Emelita has been engaged in her business for over 22 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Emelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Emelita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Emelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Por lo que sus inicios surgen con muy poco capital,  y con fondos propios pero con muchas ganas de salir adelante. Poco a poco fue incrementando su inventario con las pocas ganancias que su negocio le generaba, hasta que se le presento la oportunidad de trabajar con Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000. El financiamiento que solicita es para comprar carne de res, cerdo, pollo, pelibuey entre otras. Su mayor sue\u00f1o es seguir con vida para mantener esta actividad.","en":"Paula Argentina, 24, sells meat.  She\u2019s been in this business for over 8 years now.

With the funds requested, she will purchase more merchandise to expand her business and satisfy a greater number of customers.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":263020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-28T15:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":79.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423736},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":79.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117005},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":79.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011926},{"amount":25.13,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":79.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595521},{"amount":25.13,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":79.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989765},{"amount":24.38,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":77.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210904}],"funded_date":"2009-01-28T17:32:22Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":90438,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a fashion designer and she also sells tailoring materials.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC.  Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, modern Western culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war that began soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged Tajikistan's already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition to potential lenders. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In 2006, she bought her first large container to keep her inventory at the market (it is common for retail stall owners here to use cargo containers as makeshift warehouses, and even stores).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She inherited the business from her aunts many years ago.\r\n\r\nDaisy B. is the treasurer.  She sells food such as \u201csalchipapas\u201d (sausage with potatoes) at night. During the day she helps her mother-in-law sell food. She has two children for whom she fights day-in day-out.\r\n\r\nThe secretary, Rosa S., has had a warehouse for 5 years.  She acquired it with her sisters and parents' support. She works hard everyday and little by little she's making it work since it is the only source of income for her and her small son.\r\n\r\nMost of the members have their own specialty such as selling clothes, shoes, cosmetics, vegetables, and food.  Mr. Angel L. has a taxi.  He is married and has a son. With a lot of effort, he purchased his car and is finishing paying for it with monthly payments.\r\n\r\nThe members know the competition in the commercial and service industries.

With the prime goal of helping her husband with the family expenses, she started her clothing sales business four years ago. This business is a good match for her because she loves sales and is a proficient saleswoman. Throughout the years, Mohira has kept up her business with much effort and dedication. And through this business, she has been able to provide an education for her three children. In order to keep the business growing, she needs a loan of 3,500 Somoni to purchase seasonal clothing. It is important for Mohira and her family to have your support.  \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lebanon. This young man decided in 2008 to start his own business by providing Internet connections to his town and its surroundings. He has been involved in this type of occupation for the past four years.\r\n\r\nDespite his young age, he is taking care of his family with his business income. His story illustrates the day-to-day challenges many people are facing in trying to take care of household expenses, sick and aging family members, and at the same time run a business. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1,000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase an Internet network in order to expand his business. This type of business is very common in Lebanon.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<\/b>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

Ibrahim bought a taxi car 5 years ago and has been using it since then. Ibrahim gave the owner of the car a down payment from his savings and started paying the rest of the cost on a monthly basis from his work returns.\r\n\r\nNow that Ibrahim has only one payment left, he came to FATEN and took a loan to pay it and fully own the car. The car is two families' source of income as Ibrahim and his son Muhammad (who appears in the picture here because Ibrahim is a conservative man and doesn't want to be in the picture) share use of the car.  The son is married and has his own family.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Hace 22 a\u00f1os que vive con Walter, quien es su pareja. Ambos tienen 2 hermosos hijos,  Kener y Randi; a los que educan en su casa propia, ubicada en la localidad de Alto Yapaz (selva peruana). Sus dos hijos son su motivaci\u00f3n para esmerarse en el trabajo cada d\u00eda, por eso desde hace 5 a\u00f1os se dedica a cultivar caf\u00e9, y pl\u00e1tano, paralelamente es negociante de frutas oriundas de la selva peruana, las cuales compra de sus vecinos y conocidos, los encajona y los traslada hacia los mercados de \u201cHuancayo\u201d y \u201cLima\u201d para comercializarlos 2 veces por semana. Por otro lado su c\u00f3nyuge brinda el servicio de transporte p\u00fablico, cubriendo la ruta \u201cSanta Ana\u201d  hasta  \u201cAlto Yapaz\u201d  y viceversa.

She has been living with her partner Walter for 22 years. They both have two beautiful children, Kener and Randi who they educate in their own home which is located in the town of Alto Yapaz (in the Peruvian jungle). Her two children are her motivation to work hard every day which is why she has been growing coffee and bananas for five years. She also sells fruits that are native to the Peruvian jungle which she buys from her neighbors and acquaintances. Twice a week she boxes them and takes them to the markets in Huancayo and Lima to sell. Her husband works in public transportation. He covers the route from Santa Ana to Alto Yapaz and vice versa. On the days that he's off he helps Herlinda in the farming and in her business. She enjoys the tranquility of the country but she finds it difficult to take her products to the food markets which is why she stores her harvests in her store. Although this work does not discourage her it is very profitable because thanks to her profits she can give her family an adequate quality of life. This is why, in the future, she plans on continuing to grow coffee in her fields but especially to increase and supply products to her establishment. She belongs to the community bank \"Los Progresistas\" (The Progressives) and this is the third loan with field partner MFP and she is sure that she will continue to work actively in the community bank since she likes to socialize with the other members. Herlinda will start the coffee harvest so she will invest the loan in paying the laboreres who she will contract to help her to collect the grain. She will also invest in implementing her grocery store at home.

This will be used to purchase sewing materials, such as threads, fabrics, etc.  Carmen hopes to receive more orders and create gorgeous and salable designs, using the additional sewing supplies, to increase her monthly sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":840766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase sewing materials such as thread, textiles, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-08-11T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":886.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232809376},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1772.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238620659},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":886.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244574892},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":886.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250786691},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":886.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257195415}],"funded_date":"2011-08-11T18:10:45Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:30:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":328944,"name":"Esther's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther\u2019s group is comprised of four hard working women.

Each piece is bought for $60 by the shopkeeper, so that this activity generates a monthly income of $120. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWith a loan of $1500, Keo S. will acquire a wood carving machine, worth $250, and a motor, worth about $100, to increase the volume and the quality of her production. She will also purchase her own stock of yellow wood, $50 per piece, and other materials required in her activity. This will allow her to substantially increase the income of her family, as these music instruments are usually sold $200 in Phnom Penh markets. We want to expand this business, S. said, because we love doing it. S. has chosen a 12 months loan term and CREDIT loan officer will visit her monthly for repayment

Like many trained Ukrainian professionals, however, Vartiter now works as a market vendor due to a lack of good paying professional jobs.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter working for a time as a leather goods specialist, Vartiter started her current business, which she has now operated for several years. Nadiya Ukraine has previously assisted her with four different loans. She has requested an additional loan of $1000 for two purposes. She needs to purchase additional inventory for her current business, and she would also like to use some money to help open a second sales kiosk where she could begin selling clothing items. She is hoping that by expanding her overall business enterprise and moving into a new area of retail she will be able to increase her income and improve her standard of

He is married and has six children.  He has a secondary school education and does not have a job.  His family's only source of income is their private livestock business in the village.  Kumriddin has a small cowshed, where he raises calves to sell.  He buys young animals at the Yavan markets, fattens them over 40-45 days, and then sells the fattened animals back at the same markets.  Now, the season for buying and selling animals has begun and Kumriddin needs to increase his turnover.  To do this, he needs extra money, so he has applied to MLF HUMO for a loan.  The additional money will not only help Kumriddin increase turnover; it will also give his family badly needed income and help them improve their lives.

She has been in this business for the past four years, and her business has grown bit by bit. She used to run the center from her home, then moved to another facility when the daycare outgrew her home. Now, she is planning to open an even larger daycare center in the center of Ayacucho. She is currently in the process of formalizing her business, along with her investment partner.\r\n\r\nAraceli is requesting a loan of 1000 soles ($325 USD) to buy rugs and ceramic tile for her daycare center. She says it will be a different kind of daycare, more responsive to the needs of a modern family. She will pick up kids at their homes so their parents don\u2019t have to worry about dropping them off, and also plans to offer educational classes for expectant mothers. \r\n\r\nAraceli\u2019s baby is due on November 24th.

In a small place which he rents, he makes the pies with course flour and meat baked in coals according to the old recipes.  He has big plans and dreams of improving his business. When he was very young, Aktam learned a great deal about sambusa preparation from his mother and that is why he decided to dedicate himself to this work. His goal is to have his own place where he can offer more comforts to his customers, and he'd like to buy a refrigerator so he can begin to offer cold drinks as well. Aktam is requesting an individual loan of 3000 Somoni. He wants to purchase the necessary supplies of foodstuffs for preparing  \u201csambusa\u201d pies and also to improve his business. He is very motivated to grow his business and increase his income. With his efforts, and your important contribution, Aktam can reach his goals. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In translation from Kirghiz the word \u201ckant\u201d means \u201csugar\u201d. However, in the past couple of years life in the city has been far from sweet. Many residents left the country in hope of finding stable employment elsewhere. The same fate was threatening Nurila and her husband. Additionally, they had four children to take care of. Traveling with them would have been uneasy at best and so Nurila\u2019s husband decided to stay and become a taxi driver. \r\nTapping into her savings, Nurila rented a container and started to sell foodstuffs. \r\nFinding a container in her home city proved problematic, however, they were able to rent one in a village twenty kilometers away. Her children had already grown and this business allowed them to remain in Kant. Her eldest daughter has already finished high school, while the rest of the children are still in school. In order to start her business, Nurila invested eight thousand soms ($180). Today her average monthly income is about ten thousand soms ($220). Nurila needs capital to invest into new products and increase her goods turnover. She also plans to buy some furniture and livestock for her household. \r\n\r\nNarila has three partners in her group: \r\n\r\nAijan is forty-four years old. Her husband is a construction worker. They have three children. Their two daughters are married and her son is in school. Aijan is a housewife. She raises livestock and sells it on the market. She makes up to ten thousand soms per month. She is requesting a loan in order to buy bull to fatten and sell. \r\n\r\nNurjan is forty-six years old. Her husband works as an electrician. She had tailored ethnic clothes and products but her friends recommended that she become a flour salesman. Nurjan decided to try it out and bought a couple bags of flour. Nurjan needs a loan to invest her capital in more flour. \r\n\r\nGulnara is forty years old. Her husband raises livestock. Gulnara works in the village of Ivanovka where she sells foodstuffs, candy and cookies. She is a mother of three children, all of which are attending school. Her eldest son will graduate this year. Gulnara is asking for a loan to buy some boxes of cookies and candy.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. Estela is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offering. This loan will be her third from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":506391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To
