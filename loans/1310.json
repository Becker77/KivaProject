They live in their own house in the small village of Nirendrapur in Moynaguri in the district of Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nKornobala in her childhood received training on how to prepare incense.

For James, it\u2019s not just about seeing the kids smile, but helping recapture the childhood memories of all the adults who frequent his truck. \u201cThere\u2019s no one that doesn\u2019t like an ice cream truck,\u201d said James.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two trucks in James\u2019 fleet, and he does both catering and traditional ice cream truck rounds in neighborhoods, where kids eagerly wait for the all too familiar jingle.  He wants to expand his business to do more corporate catering and is using his $5,000 Kiva loan to purchase a pushcart where he can serve personalized frozen treats at corporate office parties and socials.\r\n\r\nThere are not many soft serve trucks in the San Diego market and in the future, he wants to expand to several trucks and have multiple employees.  His ultimate business dream is nothing flashy; he just wants to provide a stable future for his wife of 11 years, their two kids, and the kids that they foster.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a humble guy who values hard work and I appreciate people who appreciate my business,\u201d said James. \u201cIt\u2019s why I love what I do.\u201d\r\n\r\nCheck out NEU Flavor\u2019s website:

This zone is characterized by inhabitants who engage in the raising and selling of small animals and cattle for milk and meat.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is 18 years old, currently single, and lives alone with his mother in a house that was granted by the government a few years ago. It has been very satisfactory for him to be able to help his mother with all of the household expenses and to support the household activities and business. He learned this work from a very young age and from that point he has been involved in milk production and the raising of animals. \r\n\r\nHe is currently studying to graduate school, because in spite of all of the necessities he has gotten ahead and now wants to have his own cattle. Through his parents' efforts he was able to finish his primary education. Because of the family's difficult economic situation, he had to work since he was very small and thus be a great help for himself and his family.\r\n\r\nHe learned this activity since it is very common in the rural sector where he lives. He works from 6 to 8 hours daily caring for the animals. It is a little difficult for him to transport the cattle to the different markets since he does not have his own transport. In spite of this, it has not been a significant problem. On the contrary, it has motivated him to get ahead for the good of himself and his family.\r\n\r\nAt the moment he requests a loan to acquire a dairy cow, which will allow him to earn more profits through the sale of milk. Jos\u00e9 would like to extend his sincere thanks and greetings to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making possible the growth in his professional and personal

is Eva, 39, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Narding and a mother to her children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEva owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which are paying *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.\r\n\r\nEva hopes to expand her business and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning, I want to say that choosing a profession is a very important thing for me. When I was small, I dreamed to become an actress and be in public. Later this dream faded, and I started to love reading and writing. Therefore I have chosen to study journalism.\r\n\r\nI think that journalism offers an opportunity to constantly develop and not stand still. Since childhood I have been very curious. I liked to compose short stories and then tell them in the afternoons to my parents and at night to my toys. \r\n\r\nIn addition, journalism is a true art. I think that the ability to write to inform society requires lots of talent. Journalists are always in the center of events, and they have to interpret the events for the reader. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I consider journalism like an adventure not only around the world, but also in knowing yourself. And I want to begin this adventure at the American University of Central Asia.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1491911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is his story:\r\n\r\nAmerican University of Central Asia is the most well-known university in Central Asia. I am lucky and proud to say that AUCA is located precisely in my country, and it gives me an amazing opportunity to get an American education without having to leave home. I have been interested in technology since I was in high school. People could see my interest while I was trying to fix computers and other electronics. I really like to figure out problems by myself, but I also wanted to learn more about computers and how they work. AUCA\u2019s Software Engineering program is what I want to study.\r\n\r\nAlong with obtaining an education, my next goals are to discover something new and incredible in technology, and to devise more valuable and practical pieces of technology. I would like to work for a place like Google or Microsoft, and I know that several AUCA Alumni from Software Engineering already work for these places.

I am requesting a loan on Kiva to pursue my Masters in Business Administration. The reason I am seeking a loan to finance my MBA is because I am the sole bread winner in my family following an accident that rendered my husband jobless in 2010. I have two teenagers who are in high school and therefore my income is stretched managing the family affairs.\n\nAfter high school, I worked for 4 years as a secretary but I felt I had capacity to do more. I developed a strong liking for the HR profession working as a Personal Assistant to an HR and Admin Manager, and it is then I decided to enroll for a diploma in Leadership and Management. I got a diploma in Leadership and Management and from there on my career in HR started. I grew within the ranks of HR profession from a Personal Assistant, HR Assisant, to HR Officer. To move from the position of a HR Officer required a degree and I enrolled for a Bachelor of Science in Leadership and Management where I got first class honors. I was promoted to the position of a Senior HR and Training Officer in 2009.\n\nI joined Juhudi Kilimo in mid 2012 as a Human Resource Manager and what really attracted me to Juhudi is their core business of financing rural farmers. Having worked in a pure for profit organization and in particular healthcare, my desire was to join a social enterprise that would focus on the development of our customers in a sustainable manner. I fell in love with Juhudi's mission, their client focus and the impact they were creating in the society. I was also excited to join Juhudi because they did not have a HR function and they wanted me to set it up and this was a great opportunity for me to put in to practice my years of experience as a HR.\n\nJuhudi is at a point in time that it requires a strong and very skilled leadership team who will be able to deliver on our promises to our farmers. As an executive heading the HR function, I will benefit greatly from the Masters in Business Administration from USIU which will give me hands on experience in functional areas related to HR like Finance, Marketing, Strategy and Entrepreneurship. I choose the Global Executive MBA from USIU as it focuses on managers who hold senior positions and the approach is very hands-on and work based. I am therefore able to transfer the newly acquired skills and knowledge into my day to day activities, creating a greater impact that Juhudi will need in the next 3 years as it scales up.\"

is an experienced farmer from Chiva village in the Vayots Dzor region.

Unfortunately, her salary is so low it is impossible to meet the very basic needs of the family. \r\n\r\nTo take care of the family's needs Armen is extensively engaged in agribusiness; he breeds cattle, sheep, and hens, and cultivates peaches, apricots, apples, pears, and walnuts. With the help of his son he sells the products in the local market, which is an important source of income. Breeding sheep is the most essential component of Armen's business; he currently wants to expand it a little bit. \r\n\r\nTo reach that goal, he needs a loan of $3,000 to purchase 30 sheep. As this is Armen\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before because they have no credit history.

name is Shadrack. I work in the Finance Department for Juhudi Kilimo, an agricultural micro finance institute in Kenya. Previously, I  worked for Turame Community Finance, in Burundi as the Finance and Administrative Director. I have been in the micro finance industry for over 12 years and I like the industry because this is where poverty, food security and health issues are well addressed. \r\nI am the first born in a family of nine, married and I have three children who are in school. When I finished high school, I started my career in accounting and managed to educate my siblings from the salary. I did so because my mother had minimum resources to educate them. After they all finished high school training, I decided to go back to school to pursue a degree in finance and later pursued my MBA, both of which I financed through bank loans.\r\nI am motivated to do a study related to the factors hindering financing for rural, small-scale farmers. I believe that this study will highlight the gaps in agricultural financing and will give practical recommendations on how financial institutions could provide appropriate financial and nonfinancial services to rural farmers in Kenya. I hope to bring the study results back to Juhudi and align it with the business growth strategy for the next four to five years. I also hope to be able to share the findings of my research with other Kiva partners in order to improve the financial product design at other MFIs to benefit loan recipients in the region.

This is his story:\r\n\r\nI have chosen to become a programmer. Ever since I was a child, I have taken a deep interest in computers and electronics. I not only like to play computer games, I am also very curious about the process of game and program development. This was one of the reasons my parents sent me to the physics and mathematics lyceum #61, where I studied from the 1st grade. While studying at school, I attended a programming course at Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radio Electronics. I also studied the basics of such programming languages as Visual Basic, \u0421++, Turbo Pascal and Delphi. For further motivation, I participated in a number of competitions (Olympiads) in mathematics and informatics: the Lomonosov Olympiad, as well as School and City Olympiads on informatics. In 2013, I took third place in the AUCA informatics competition, which gave me a partial scholarship.\r\n\r\nAside from programming, I like to read sci-fi books, play chess, and devote my free time to physical activities, such as practicing aikido, wushu, and football. When it came to choosing a university, I knew that the AUCA was exactly what I needed. Not only because it is the best and most prestigious university in Kyrgyzstan, but also because it provides opportunities for all-around development of an individual and improvement of leadership skills through a number of intellectual contests and cultural events. This allows young people to become more communicative and self-confident, which is very important for better social integration and competitiveness on the labor market.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1491933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is for the drilling of a well and an elevated storage tank.\n\nIt is now suffering from sedimentation, and the flow is drying up.  That is why, in assembly, they resolve to sign a contract with a company to drill a well.  They need 80,000 liters of water a day, and they need to build an elevated tank to keep and distribute the water.  To do this, they have part of their resources in a savings account.  However, in order to complete the amount, they need a loan.\n\nThe neighborhood has grown to more than 250 families.  Currently, the are not covering the difference because of supply.  It is a neighborhood that, little by little, and with their own contributions, is addressing different works of improvement in order to achieve a better quality of life for all of the families that live in the community. \n\nThe board of directors is comprised of Martha, Ada, Rosario, and Rober.

He produces milk from buffaloes two times a day and sells it to the retailers, which is a very tough job for a single person. He has been purchasing fodder in bulk and has been feeding his cattle for months. He has to buy fodder in bulk and build up his cowshed as well. However, due to lack of funds, he is unable to buy fodder and materials for the construction of the cowshed.\r\n\r\nHe requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so he can overcome these deficiencies and carry on his dairy farm smoothly. \r\n\r\nFrom the profit amount, he would like to start his own livestock breeding business also, as he has now acquired sufficient experience

He is married and has two toddler children. Paata\u2019s mother lives with his family, as well. Paata\u2019s mother works at the local culture house, as an accountant, and his wife is a cleaner in the same institution. \r\n\r\nTheir salaries are modest and hardly enough to cover feeding and household expenses. To improve their earnings, the family decided to start a bakery in their yard, to bake bread. They've already built the building, but they need additional funds to purchase pastry-making equipment. \r\n\r\nPaata hopes his project will be profitable since he lives on a crowded street and similar bakeries are not located nearby.

She has been with her life partner for 38 years. He is a baker and farmer, and they have four children, who live in their own homes. Blanca's two grandchildren, ages 10 and 6, live with her and are in elementary school.\r\n\r\nBlanca learned bread making as a child. When she was 19, she decided to do this for a living because she couldn't find any other way to help her family and to share the household expenses. She and her husband opened a bakery. They used to sell bread that was baked by others. Now they make the bread, buy the ingredients in the city, which is a 34 kilometer trip, and pay to have the supplies delivered to their house.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy flour, sugar, honey, and more. The loan will aid her business because it will give her a chance to meet customer demand for bread, which is significant in her town. She will earn more money for her family members and provide better food for them. Blanca wants to keep making bread and to open shops throughout the town where she lives. She dreams of exporting her product because it is delicious. She hopes that her family has a better, dignified life. She would like to use her profit to buy another baking oven so that she can produce more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1482721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

representative. Isaac is on the right in the photo with his hand raised. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\n\nIsaac is married and has eight children.  He is 58 years old and is known as hardworking, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and the burial committee. Isaac has been a farmer for 46 years. He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \n\nIsaac first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season. He joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods and earn enough income to send his children to school. \n\nHe volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Isaac plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school and repair his home.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Isaac\u2019s own life improved because he has more profits from his harvest, has more farm training and was able to save money. \t\n\nIsaac's Group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  The loan will go toward the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. Farming materials will be delivered to him and the 65 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings each.\n\nOne Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

He also produces yogurt and butter for his family's personal use. He has three buffaloes and milks them twice a day. He sells milk in front of his house and also sells by going door to door. He is single and responsible for all household expenses. His main challenges are a rapid increase in both inflation and in household expenses. M. Hanif requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan to buy an additional buffalo so he has more milk to sell. He will use some of his profits to buy fodder. He hopes that his production will increase and that he can easily cope with inflation. M. Hanif thanks Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan, for their assistance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1512096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy an additional buffalo to make more milk.

At 21 she is the mother of 2 minor children who depend upon her and her husband.  She completed an elementary school education thanks to the unconditional support of her parents.  Her parents also taught her to work the land from an early age, specializing in the cultivation of corn and beans.  Along with her husband, Emely is continuing to work the land, cultivating staple grains.  Her husband is a farmer and is also a merchant, selling fresh fish in their community.  \r\n\r\nEmely sells her grains to the warehouses and wholesalers, and she sells fish to relatives, friends and neighbors, and to other buyers who want her quality products.  Her corn and bean fields are located 20 minutes from her house, and she gets there on a mule or by walking, and only the two of them are involved in this work.  In the future, Emely plans to build her own house so that she can support her children in every way possible so that they don't end up in the same situation she did, because agricultural work is hard, and at times risky.  If the crops are not given treatments on time and the maintenance they need, it is possible to lose the whole harvest.\r\n\r\nToday, Emely is requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies to support and maintain her crops of corn and beans so that she will get an excellent harvest at the end of the season, enabling her to sell her products at a very good price in the market.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1492598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

His siblings are still young; his father has grown old and does not have a job. All Boota's efforts are for providing comfort to his parents and his siblings.\r\n\r\nBoota is a milkman by profession; he sells milk to customers and bull calves to the butcher. He has been doing this business for many years and earns a reasonable income for his family. He has a few buffaloes, which he milks twice a day. He provides door-to-door milk service to his customers and collects money on a monthly basis. \r\n\r\nBoota is confident that he can increase his herd through breeding. His current buffaloes produce milk and he does not have any other buffalo to use for breeding. He has increased his herd through breeding in the past, as he has now acquired sufficient experience in the breeding system. However, due to lack of funds, it seems impossible to buy an additional buffalo because a healthy buffalo is expensive. Therefore, Boota has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that he can buy an additional buffalo for breeding. He wants to continue his breeding system in the future, because he can easily increase his herd and generate more income through milk production. \r\n\r\nBoota thanks Kiva and its field partner BRAC

She lives with her elderly pensioner parents. \r\n\r\nTo take care of her family, Arevhat has been engaged in agribusiness for more than 20 years. She is involved in cattle breeding, in breeding livestock of sheep, in beekeeping, and in the cultivation of wheat, potatoes, cabbage, apples, pears, and walnuts. She sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of her family's income. \r\n\r\nTo continue running her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Arevhat needs to make some investments. A loan of USD 3,000 will help this hard working woman and her family a lot by enabling her to purchase forage for cattle and to pay for the transportation and harvesting services. \r\n\r\nAs this is Arevhat\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. \r\n\r\nArevhat and her family rely on the goodwill of the lenders, and will appreciate their support in collecting the needed amount of the loan to maintain and develop their agribusiness.

Jactan has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 34 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJactan is 79 years old and has been a farmer for 68 years.  Jactan works as a farmer to provide for his 12 children.  The community and other farmers know Jactan as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the Men's Group, Savings Group, Prayer Group and the Burial Committee.  Jactan described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of the One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nJactan joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Jactan joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  Because he likes being a leader, and he is an active community member, Jactan wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Jactan has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Jactan's life because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, has more farm group support, is able to save money and feed the family.  In the future, Jactan hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Jactan and the Baraka Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1485571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jactan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":181866,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181866}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2125,"local_amount":181866,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-28T10:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":184022.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722842}],"funded_date":"2014-02-15T11:09:43Z","paid_date":"2014-12-28T10:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maadhavi Ramanayake","image":null}},{"id":646555,"name":"Twizerane Cb Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"Twizerane\" group means \"Trust each other\" group in English.

He lives with his wife, two school-aged daughters and little son.  Mirza's wife is a private teacher and generates approximately 300 GEL monthly. This is the only source of income for the family nowadays.  For lack of economic resources,  Mirza was unable to get higher education. That\u2019s why he can't find any stable job. So Mirza decided to start his own private business to generate some income. He applied for the credit with MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of the startup program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  A loan of $1,200 will help Mirza to start a car trading business. He will purchase cars abroad at low prices, and will sell them locally at a good price. He will start his business with selling his own car and add this money to the requested loan. Misha is a very enthusiastic and motivated person, with a great desire to ensure his children with a good education for progressing in life. This credit will be a great support for the family. Mirza is thankful to Kiva lenders for giving him a chance to generate income."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1512142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

Halima used her previous loans to buy business stock of soft drinks, rice, beans, and soaps of different kinds.  She has successfully paid back all her previous loans. With her profits, Halima covered school fees and household expenses and saved. She will use this loan to buy a refrigerator and soft drinks for her shop. Halima dreams that one day she will be able to grow her business more than before. \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group, HATUA, which totals two members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

Asmani has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and he is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 71 other individual farmers represented by this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAsmani is 63 years old and has been a farmer for 40 years. Asmani works as a farmer to provide for his five children. The community and other farmers know Asmani as friendly, hardworking, reliable, and trustworthy. Besides farming, he is also involved in his community, such as the savings group and prayer group. Asmani described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAsmani joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Asmani joined One Acre Fund so that he can get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, and earn enough to feed his family. Because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Asmani has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Asmani's life because he has more profits from his harvest, and was able to feed the family. In the future, Asmani hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and invest in a business.  \t\t\t\t\n\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Asmani and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer packages from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With the support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe field officer is also included

For over 25 years, Evelina has been running a farm. Specifically, her farm includes cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens as well as arable land where she cultivates wheat, potatoes and cabbage. Her son helps Evelina to sell the gathered harvest in the local open markets and earn an income for their living. As the only source of income, agriculture helps this family to cover their daily needs and sustain their living. Now, Evelina asks for this loan to purchase seeds, eight sheep and forage for feeding the livestock. This will help her to enlarge her farm and agribusiness. \r\n\r\nEvelina has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Evelina was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.\r\n \r\nThe loan is a hope for this family to overcome financial difficulties and improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1646.41,"image":{"id":1512175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Two of her children have completed high school while one is still in school. The two could not proceed to college due to financial constraints and now they have joined their mother in the farming business. The family depends on the 3 acre piece of land for agriculture and dairy farming to get income for their basic needs. They grow vegetables and cereal for their food, and fodder for their 5 cows.\r\n\r\nAfter a training in their group about Biogas by VEP officials, Tabitha approached VEP to have a Biodigester constructed for her. All she would need is money and the expertise offered by VEP and many of her problems especially fuel problems would be solved. She now appreciates that money spent buying charcoal and kerosine can be saved, by using biogas for cooking and lighting. She will also practice organic farming by using bio-slurry which will lead to higher yield. This way she can have enough food for the family and probably sell some. With the savings and a little income she hopes her daughters can enroll in a college for a diploma course and this will give them a better future. For sure biogas will improve their livelihoods."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1028.21,"image":{"id":1512194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

She is a hard-working and responsible woman with a desire to get ahead.  Unfortunately, for financial reasons, Anita was unable to finish her education as she had to help with the household costs.  Previously Anita worked selling scrap metal but, with a new loan, she has decided to start a grocery store in her home where she will sell small quantities of household goods such as sachets of coffee and shampoo, tomato sauce, oil, rice, beans, juices, bread, eggs, salt, sugar, milk, frozen products and more.  Anita's day starts very early when she opens her grocery store to tend to her customers.  This loan will be used to invest in working capital and stock up her business with consumable goods such as rice, sugar, beans, oil, detergents, sweets, toilet paper, frozen goods, and more.
