She doesn\u2019t have any other income-generating activity.  She has a business selling used clothes and has been in this business for five years. She has applied for a loan of 700,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more bales of used clothes. She generates additional income from frying edibles and selling charcoal.  She moves door-to-door selling used clothes and sells on a retail basis seven days out of every week. Her major business challenges include transportation, thieves and seasonality.

has been involved in beekeeping for 20 years. He owns 30 colonies of bees, gets high quality honey and sells it locally. As honey is a must have item for almost each household of Eghegnadzor town and the whole region, Khoren has a good number of buyers. \r\n\r\nBecause of a hard financial situation Khoren is unable to invest in his beekeeping business and enlarge it. Therefore, he has applied for this loan. It will enable him to purchase 16 beehives and 13 colonies of bees, and also he will pay for a polyethylene cover for a greenhouse. This is very important for Khoren to enlarge his business and increase the income for his family.\r\n\r\nKhoren has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back on time. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Khoren was able to run his honey selling business in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, Khoren has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2726.71,"image":{"id":1512320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been responsible for the family since her husband passed away. Today she is the sole breadwinner for two members of her family. The rest of the family started their own businesses to make living easier for their mother.\r\n\r\nRanda is a hard worker who started a knitting business in her home 25 years ago. She is a very talented and skilled knitter. Twenty-one years ago, she also started a small business in her home, creating souvenirs for weddings, births, and other special events. She also arranges special artificial flowers bouquets.\r\n\r\nRanda has been an Al Majmoua borrower for four consecutive cycles. Through her previous loans, Randa was able to buy tools and other items necessary for her business in order to increase the amount of special souvenirs. She also helped to open a grocery store for her son to increase her family's income. There has been a very impressive result on both their social and financial situations. \r\n\r\nToday, she is applying for a new loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua in order to increase her knitted merchandise. She wants to create special released wool colors and designs and to work on developing and increasing her production for the Christmas and winter season. She will also use part of the loan to purchase electric household appliances for her son who is getting ready to get married.\r\n\r\nRanda's history is in good standing, and she is working hard to open a small school that teaches the making of handmade souvenirs, embroidering, knitting, and other arts. This is her dream that she hopes to make come true.

This group consists of 11 members and is led by a Board of Directors in which Sra. Vanesa serves as the secretary.  The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as making sportswear, selling baby sweaters, providing day care services, managing a neighborhood store, selling gifts, selling lettuce, selling beds, and selling woven clothing.\r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Vanesa.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer two years ago after receiving an invitation from a friend who is also a member of the organization.  Vanessa currently has a neighborhood store as her business.  She is knowledgeable about this type of work because she learned it from her sister, who also has the same type of business in her area.  For this reason, she decided to replicate the business because her neighbors needed a place to shop.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying noodles, sugar, oil, rice, and other products.  Vanesa acquires her inventory from wholesale distributors in the city of El Alto and then sells the products from her retail space.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income to support her family.  Vanesa is in a common-law relationship and has two children.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Vanesa says that she enjoys the training seminars and the focus on health.

All the children are in school. Gulmira has a high school education. As a main source of income for her family, Gulmira raises livestock, having begun 15 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 6,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Gulmira currently has on her homestead: one dairy cow, one horse, and 20 sheep. Monthly income consists of 5,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>In order to prevent loss of livestock, Gulmira plans to conduct a series of veterinary measures. Hay and feed for the livestock have been procured. With the aim of further developing her homestead, Gulmira turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan - to purchase sheep for expanding her count of livestock. <br \/><br \/>Gulmira is a homemaker; in her free time from house work, she sews. Gulmira plans to invest income from the loan to further propagate the quantity of domestic animals, and plans to save money to buy a sewing

He is married and has four children. He is engaged in breeding cows and bulls. His family supports him in the business. Instead of a shepherd, his elder son takes the cattle to pasture. Sherali bought his son a horse, in order to be able to easily bring their cattle to pasture.

Hadyatullo is married to Mohichien, and they have two small children. Their daughters were born in 2011 and 2013. In Tajikistan, there is clean air and incomparable nature. Taking advantage of the favorable climate, Hadyatullo decided to start working with livestock.

She says that the main challenges to her business are insufficient capital to run her business, and proper business location.\r\n\r\nFatu requires a loan in order to purchase more charcoal for resale.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay County is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nSamson is married and has seven children. He also cares for two orphans from the area. He works as a pastor, serving two gospel churches, and as a community mobilizer, organizing local groups in the area. In addition to this work, Samson also farms, and is currently growing maize, sweet potatoes, kale, sunflower, amaranth, and tomatoes, as well as rearing cows and chickens. He likes beekeeping because honey is a nutritious food, and the bees will pollinate his sunflowers, leading to higher yields and a higher income. \r\n\r\nThis is Samson\u2019s first loan, and he plans to use the income from his hives to educate his children, as well as improve his land by adding more trees for his bees to forage on. Samson\u2019s hope for the future is to improve his housing, start a bank account, and reduce the amount of times his children have to skip school days due to lack of fee payments. \r\n\r\nSamson would like to thank his Kiva lenders \u201cfor the support through this loan for I believe this is moving me from one level to another especially in supporting the orphans to feel they have belonging.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1485329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives for honey production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Sindo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-17T23:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T23:30:20Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T00:55:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":646704,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel lives and works close to Sindo, in Homa Bay County. Homa Bay County is located at the southwestern tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people, and a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay County often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay County means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average. \r\n\r\nDaniel is married and has seven children. Daniel volunteers as a health worker and a veterinarian, while his wife runs a small kiosk business. He and his wife are also taking care of four orphans whose parents have passed away.

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts, and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nPetro is married and has nine children and many grandchildren. He has retired from his job as a union labourer, while his wife is engaged in selling cereals. He has been farming for 50 years, and is currently growing maize, millet, beans, lentils, sunflower, and amaranth, as well as raising dairy goats and local cattle. Petro thinks that beekeeping is a good business as \u201cit is not a tiresome activity.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is Petro\u2019s first loan, and he plans to use the income from his beehives to pay school fees for his grandchildren.

By applying for this loan, Dianna would like to purchase two more cows and enlarge her livestock. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to repay it. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Dianna was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. The loan is a hope for this family and they will be very grateful to lenders' for

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Toktokan approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to purchase cows for breeding.

He lives in a remote area with his family and is engaged in animal husbandry. The primary source of income in the region is agriculture and animal husbandry. He is not married. Umidmurod has been doing this business for more than three years. The local climate is very favorable for farming and keeping livestock. He has a big garden where he grows hay for cattle.

Kamala has a secondary education. Kamala's livestock business is the primary source of income for the family. She started four years ago when she bought 70,000 KGS worth of livestock. Because of Kamala's hard work, her farm now has two milk cows, one horse, one calf, two sheep, three lambs, five goats, and five kids. Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Kamala turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy sheep for breeding. Kamala plans to invest profits from the loan into expanding her livestock, and she plans to save enough money educate her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1935.19,"image":{"id":1510097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Belaldy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-17T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":151.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1018.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":611.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":814.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":305.56,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15078.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749703},{"amount":923.05,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50261.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":95.46,"payment_id":595436007},{"amount":555.39,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":30156.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":55.73,"payment_id":664995319}],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T16:14:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":641413,"name":"Jenelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenelyn works hard to support her family.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Abduvohid likes farming as it allows him not only to earn money for his family, but provide them with fresh, ecologically-pure vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Abduvohid lives with his wife and 4 children in the Qubadiyon region of Tajikistan.  Apart from farming, he also works as a taxi driver.  At the moment, he is sowing his fields and needs a loan to stock up on wheat seeds and mineral fertilizers.  He is counting on your

is from Sayat Nova village. She lives there with her husband, retired parents-in-law and 20-year-old daughter. \r\n\r\nAnahit and her husband run a small but beautiful farm. They keep chickens, pigs and a cow. They also own a greenhouse where they cultivate greens. Unfortunately the greenhouse is too old and needs to be renovated, but Anahit has not saved money for that. \r\n\r\nAnahit has applied for this loan to purchase seeds, fertilizer, and a polyethylene cover for the greenhouse. The loan will greatly assist Anahit to bring the farm to working conditions and enlarge the cultivation of greens. Anahit has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Anahit was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. The loan is a hope for Anahit to continue his agribusiness and she relies on lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575.91,"image":{"id":1512404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He and his wife lead a happy life and are doing all they can to give a good life to their child.  Rustam makes a living from his own business and has been involved in buying and selling fruits and vegetables for a few years already.  He used to work on a mid-size farm in the past, but he then decided to sell his own harvest.  Using his own truck, he now transports his crops and sells them at the market in town.   He also buys other types of fruits and vegetables at the market and resells them in his own store.  This business brings him a stable and good income.\r\n\r\nRustam now wants to expand his business and he would also like to build a small kiosk, next to his house, where his wife could sell fruits and vegetables.  He plans to use his loan to buy a large selection of fruits and vegetables.  He has turned to Arvand to receive this loan, and he is hoping for a positive outcome.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1498350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who don\u2019t have access to credit products because they have no credit history.\r\n\r\nShant hopes for the loan's support and the loan will be a huge support for him and his family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1512426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for 20 sheep and forage for feeding the livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Haykadzor village, Shirak region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-01-17T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shant","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":154.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":155.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":158.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":158.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":160.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":161.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":162.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":168.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":170.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":172.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":174.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":175.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":177.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":178.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.74},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.51},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":646780,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary lives and works outside of Sindo, in Homa Bay County.

The cultivated grass isn't enough to feed all the livestock and Artur is unable to purchase other types of forage because of hard financial conditions.

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nHelen is married and has nine children. Both Helen and her husband farm, but also have businesses on the side: Helen sells fish and her husband works in a livestock business. Helen has been farming for 10 years and is currently growing millet, lentils, groundnuts, maize and mangoes on her land. She also tends to dairy goats, cows and poultry. \r\n\r\nThis is Helen\u2019s first loan and she plans to use the income generated by her hives to help pay her children\u2019s school fees and to invest in new crops like sunflowers, which she says will help her bees and increase her income. Helen\u2019s hope for the future is to grow her small business and receive training in business management, eventually reaching a level where she can become a trainer of trainers.

He realizes the agricultural products in the local market, which is the main source of family\u2019s income. Hovhannes\u2019 wife assists him greatly in his everyday activities related to farming. Hovhannes currently wants to expand his agribusiness to be able to more effectively cover the growing expenses of his family. To reach his goal, he needs a loan of USD 2,000 to purchase two steers, to buy some forage (alfalfa) for them, and to build a greenhouse. As this is Hovhannes\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. Hovhannes and his family rely on the good will of the lenders and will be very thankful to them for their support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1492239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two steers and forage and to build a greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Mrgashat village, Armavir region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-18T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hovhannes","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":103.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":103},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":105.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":106.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":106.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":108.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":108.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":109.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":111.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":112.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":113.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":114.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":116.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":117.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":118.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":119.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":658129,"name":"Sanh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sanh is a 50-year-old married woman.

She lives with her husband, two school-age sons, and her one-year-old daughter. To take care of her family\u2019s needs, Emma is engaged in an agribusiness. With the help of her husband, she is involved in horticulture. They cultivate peaches, plums, and grapes, and realize the agricultural in the local market. The latter is the main source of the family\u2019s income. To continue her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Emma needs to make some investments. A loan of USD 500 will be a huge support for this young hard working woman and her family and will enable her to purchase fertilizers and special medications for her trees, and to buy fuel for agricultural machinery. As this is Emma\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. Emma and her family highly rely on the good will of the lenders and will appreciate their support in collecting the needed amount of the loan to maintain and develop their agribusiness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1492241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers and special medications for trees, and to buy fuel for agricultural machinery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Khanjyan village, Armavir region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-18T05:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T05:50:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":40.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":42.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":43.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":43.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449735787},{"amount":41,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T09:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459215048},{"amount":41,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468040054},{"amount":41,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479257407},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490953966},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504392764},{"amount":214,"local_amount":214,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":214,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517669576}],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T12:04:09Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T16:29:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":658132,"name":"Tinh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tinh, a 30-year-old father of three, lives with his family in Ho Chi Minh City.
