raising three children together with her husband. Zamira has secondary education. She is a housewife, a happy mother and a good wife. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Zamira works with livestock breeding. She has worked with this activity for many years, with positive results. She started 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zamira's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows, 60 sheep and three horses. She has all conditions for keeping livestock: A barn for keeping livestock and pastures. They harvest hay and forage on their own plot of land. The monthly income is 20,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zamira turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows to increase the number of livestock.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay County is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe.

Homa Bay County is located at the southwestern tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three East African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people.  A market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay County often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares.  Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay County means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education.  As a result, school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average. \r\n\r\nJames is married, and has ten children. James farms and engages in grain banking, while his wife also farms and sells fish in the market.

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts, and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nRose is widowed and has six children. She works as a community health worker and a primary teacher in school, as well as working on projects on her land. She grows maize, beans, amaranth, and sunflower, rears dairy goats and cows, and also keeps her own bees. Lastly, she does \"green banking,\" which involves bulking up cereals during harvest when the price is low and selling them when the prices goes up.

He has retired from the position of local chief in the municipal government and now focuses on farming his land. He has been farming for 40 years and is currently growing sunflower, maize, sorghum, and beans and he has many acacia trees on his land that he tends to. \r\n\r\nBernard sees beekeeping as a beneficial source of income for not only private individuals, but also institutions like schools and it can enable these organizations to financially support themselves. \r\n\r\nThis is Bernard\u2019s first loan and he plans to use the income to pay school fees for his children, establish tree nurseries, and to assist orphans and other vulnerable members of the community. \r\n\r\nHis hope for the future is to have a wealthy family and to live in an educated community.

Thanks to Zina's persistent work, her farm currently has three dairy cows, one horse and 30 sheep. She also has her own plot of land, on which she grows hay and clover for livestock consumption. She harvests the hay and fodder for her livestock from her land allotment, and currently it is in sufficient quantities for her. The monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With an aim to further develop her business, Zina turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows for increasing the number of livestock.

She is in her second semester and it has been a marvelous experience for her and her mother, Jenny, who is the engine of her life. She would like to be an officer of the Colombian army because she has realized that in Colombia they value war more than freedom and peace.  She also states that she would like to do social work so she can help needy children in regions where there is armed conflict. Earning a Legal certificate is essential for Laura because it is an important step in realizing her dream. She is passionate about and is doing very well at criminal and constitutional law, two subjects that are covered at CampoAlto. In addition, Laura has another certificate in Marketing and Sales which she earned at Nazaret Technical Institute under SENA.

Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nMaria is married, and has ten children. Both she and her husband have been farming for twenty years, and are currently growing maize, beans, soy, amaranth, and sunflower.

Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Sindo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-18T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-19T08:11:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":647140,"name":"Patricia Yanet","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Patricia, a sus 33 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a trabajar como comerciante independiente desde hace aproximadamente 1 a\u00f1o, vende mercanc\u00eda en general como ropa, perfumer\u00eda, ropa interior entre otros, sus principales clientes son vecinos, familiares y amigos.

negocio.\n\nMiguel no recuerda exactamente, el tiempo que tiene de dedicarse propiamente al servicio de mec\u00e1nica, porque lo hace de peque\u00f1o, lo aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres y le gusto por lo que sigue trabajando en lo mismo, tambi\u00e9n hace trabajos de estructuras met\u00e1licas, como hacer puertas, ventanas, poner techos en viviendas, etc. el trabajo lo hace en su casa y  busca personas para que le ayuden, lo hace sin pensar en tiempo, porque cree que el hecho que lo busquen a trabajar es una bendici\u00f3n. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando, es para arreglar los

Con el pr\u00e9stamo, lograra solucionar el problema de los papeles, las ganancias del cr\u00e9dito las utilizara para pagar una cuota de un cr\u00e9dito de una de sus hijas que viajo a los estados unidos, la cual no le ayudo a pagarlo estando alla.  \n\n","en":"Miguel is 70 years old and has a spouse.  His wife has a store where she spends her time selling.  Their children don't live at home anymore as they have their own families. A foster child and two granddaughters live with him, but only his wife is dependent on him even though she has her own business. Miguel doesn't remember exactly how long he has been working as a mechanic because he has been doing it since he was young.  He learned the skill from his parents, liked it and stayed with it. He also works on metal structures such as making doors, windows, putting roofs on houses, etc. He does the work from home and looks for people to help him. He is never concerned about the time he spends because he thinks it is blessing enough that people seek his services. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to take care of the paperwork for a vehicle, which, due to the fact that the previous owner passed away, is causing difficulties and incurring expenses. It is hard for him to scrape together the money he needs at this time.  The loan will help him to increase his income and improve his finances; on occasion he has been asked to transport wood or other kinds of materials but he hasn't done it for fear that the authorities will confiscate the vehicle. He plans on continuing with his business as before, working to meet his daily needs. He wants to resolve the issue with the vehicle so that if one day he loses his life he won't be leaving bigger problems for his children. With the loan he will be able to solve the problem with the paperwork and he will use the extra money to make a payment on a loan taken out by one of his daughters who traveled to the US and who has not helped with the payments since she has been there.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1512675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to take care of the paperwork for a vehicle, due to the fact that he bought it and then the previous owner passed away","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-17T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":58.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":81.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.22,"local_amount":56.22,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":56.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088565},{"amount":65.51,"local_amount":65.51,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":65.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902823},{"amount":53.83,"local_amount":53.83,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":53.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216016},{"amount":61.26,"local_amount":61.26,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":61.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817373},{"amount":64.14,"local_amount":64.14,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":64.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242828},{"amount":65.83,"local_amount":65.83,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":65.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525909},{"amount":68.23,"local_amount":68.23,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":68.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008404},{"amount":364.98,"local_amount":364.98,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":364.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500491}],"funded_date":"2014-02-16T17:23:43Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:28:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":647171,"name":"Merlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlinda is 50 years old and married with eight children.\r\n\r\nMerlinda works hard to provide for her family.

Bandung is a major city in West Java, located about a two-hour drive from Jakarta. Komisah is married and has two children. Komisah is running a small stall that sells medicine and mobile phone airtime credits, and services bill payments.\r\n \r\nShe felt interested in joining Ruma because she wanted to expand her business. She is glad that her business was assisted and supported by Ruma agents. For the last month, she has had around $30-$40 per day sales on average just from selling mobile phone airtime credits.

She is glad that her business was assisted and supported by Ruma agents. For the last three months, she has had around $25-$26 per day sales on average just from selling mobile phone airtime credits. She hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva to process more mobile phone airtime credits and bill payment transactions on weekends when more people tend to come to her stall.

and, with her husband, raising one daughter. Gulayim has a secondary education. Tor provide the primary source of income for her family, Gulayim farms and keeps livestock. She started 27 years ago when she bought cattle with 10,000 KGS.  Because of Gulayim's hard work, her farm now has five dairy cows, fifteen sheep, ten goats, and also a 0.32 hectare plot of land where she grows potatoes, corn, and sunflowers. Also there is a small orchard with apple trees, which produces a good harvest. Right now, she has three tons of apples in her cellar which she will sell before the New Year, since then there will be strong demand and high prices for fruit. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Gulayim approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cattle for fattening and resale. Gulayim plans to invest profits she nets from the loan in to further expanding her livestock. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":1492086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cows to fatten and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chuy-Belent village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-18T22:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T22:30:12Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":155.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulayim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":27500},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":27500},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":27500},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":27500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":27798.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178386},{"amount":1531.6,"local_amount":82500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":83396.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":155.9,"payment_id":595435921}],"funded_date":"2014-01-30T16:21:19Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":647177,"name":"Narcisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narcisa works hard to support her family.

They know one another through ties of parentage, neighborhood, and friendship. They sell grains, sauces and clothing. The women of the Benkadi group are on their twenty-fourth group loan. The client Mariam Seydou, the only one sitting, is a saleswoman of traditional West African cloth (pagne). She expects to buy 10 of these cloths in Dio\u00efla, which will be resold at retail in the village and in surrounding areas to a clientele made up entirely of women for cash.

It is known for its beautiful beaches which are visited year-round by tourists from Ecuador and other countries.  Here, most of the people are engaged in fishing and jobs related to the sea. This is where Martha lives.  She is 40 years old, married and has four children from this relationship, ages 15, 13, 11 and 9. The two older ones are in secondary school and the younger ones are in elementary school. Her husband is a fisherman.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, with the help of her first loan, Martha began her business.  She set up a small store in her house and stocked with food items. Over time and with the help of loans it has gradually improved.  She works every day from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m., sometimes later, and gets help from her children and her husband.  She has put a lot of love and dedication into her store and is now reaping the rewards with which she is supporting her family.

She works very hard to get him ahead.  She makes her living working as an independent businesswoman.  She sells pastries that she makes herself.  Paola learned the trade from her father, who worked as a baker all of Paola's life.  As a hobby and out of a love for baking, Paola took classes at a baking school.  She improved her knowledge of baking and perfected her technique.  Paola saw baking as a good source of income, which was in line with her plans for the future and her desire to get ahead.  She started promoting her products on social media.  Paola works from home making cupcakes, deserts, cakes and other advance-order items.  Through this work, she generates enough income to support her household.  Nevertheless, she wants to set up her business in a commercial space which she has already rented.  Paola needs the help of the loan to purchase her fixed assets (display cabinets, a mixer, kitchen utensils, an oven, a refrigerator and other items), raw materials (flour, sugar, margarine, eggs, milk and other items) and to make some improvements to the space.  Then she will be able to kick off her project.  She hopes to get to know the market and increase her sales. \r\nPaola is an active and determined woman.  She intends, in the future, to stand out in her field by strengthening her business and opening pathways to other points of sale.  All this would guarantee her favorable financial stability so she could offer her son a better sense of well-being and a better quality of life.

Her husband taught her the ins & outs of cattle farming; a trade which actually has a lot of interesting facets and nuances to it, despite what you might think at first.  Her family helps her tend to her cattle with the exception of her husband, who left the country as a migrant worker to try and bolster the family's finances.  Barchinoy works equally as hard as her husband to provide for their family, and would like to develop her cattle-farming business further as it's a crucial source of income for them.

two children with her husband. The eldest son is nine years old, and the daughter is five. Gulmira is a very caring mother, a good housewife, and a good daughter-in-law. Gulmira and her family live with her 75-year-old mother-in-law and 81-year old grandmother. Gulmira manages to do the housework and child-rearing. Gulmira has a secondary education. The family's main source of income is animal husbandry. Gulmira started this nine years ago when she bought 20,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Gulmira's hard work, her farm now has two dairy cows, one horse, one calf, and a 2.70 hectare land share where she grows wheat and corn every year. Gulmira's husband buys and sells cow hides. Their gross monthly income is 8,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Gulmira approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cows for breeding. Gulmira plans to invest profits she makes from the loan into expanding her livestock, and plans to save enough money educate her  children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1492069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chon-Kapka village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-18T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":75.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":812.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":812.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40153.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947018},{"amount":737.43,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":40153.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":75.07,"payment_id":595435920}],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T08:25:00Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":647197,"name":"Yet's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A citizen from a rural village of Kandal province\u2019s Sa Ang district, Yet is 34 years old.

She has two children and is in a common law marriage with her significant other. During her working life she worked as an employee in several restaurants. That's where she acquired experience and knowledge on how to handle this type of business. Thanks to that, a month ago she decided to become self-employed and set up her own fast food stall. She has the advantage of not facing direct competition in this segment, which is why she has obtained good results so far. She requests the loan in order to use it to do remodeling work (repair the sidewalk), purchase tables and chairs, finish paying for the fixed assets that she already acquired, and purchase wholesale supplies (bread, cold cuts, spices, cheese, cooking oil, etc.). That way she'll be able to provide a higher quality service in terms of the food, the comfort in her premises and the courtesy. This means that she'll move forward and improve her sales.\r\nAlicia dreams of opening a restaurant in a commercial area that is large and well-known in the segment. This restaurant could create employment opportunities and allow her to ensure that her children's living conditions and well-being will improve, so they can enjoy this as a

He has been involved in poultry-keeping. Onik also owns arable land where he cultivates wheat, potatoes and tomatoes. He sells the agricultural products to local re-sellers and earns income which is very important for sustaining a living. \r\n\r\nAs the only worker in the family, Onik feels very responsible for providing good living conditions for his mother. He has requested this loan for financial help which he needs for purchasing poultry, special forage for feeding them, and fertilizer for cultivation. This will enable Onik to enlarge his poultry-keeping which is very important to him.

In particular, they have cows and a plot of agricultural land where nuts and grapes are grown. Gocha sells the farm's products locally. He always has fresh and high quality products. For further development, Gocha decided to be involved in another activity parallel to agricultural and he requested a loan. His application was approved within the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo that enables people to start or re-start a business. So, with the approved loan, he will buy a truck and work with private orders. Gocha's income will significantly increase with the help of this new activity.

That gave me the chance to learn English, but I did not like the school in general because it had too few subjects and too few teachers. Many of my classmates graduated and are still not sure of where they will be able to work in the future. I am happy to be studying at AUCA because I know that when I graduate I will be able to get a job. I really want to help improve the education system in Kyrgyzstan, and I think that studying sociology will help me to understand the people and how they think, and that will help me to be able to change the system. At AUCA I will have future prospects. There are a lot of opportunities to improve my talents, to study abroad, and to be a part of the AUCA community. For example, I will take a Spanish class, since I have always wanted to learn this

Now they are all successful, and I know that I want to follow in their path.\r\n\r\nI would like to study psychology to know and understand people's behavior and mental processes. It is interesting for me the way people behave in similar situations, and how they can be influenced by environmental and other conditions. I want to understand what factors help shape and define who we are and find out what motivates the behavior and decisions of individuals. After I graduate I want to be a psychotherapist and my dream is to help people to understand their problems.\r\n\r\nStudents in AUCA are hardworking and eager to study and to be successful. It is important for me to surround myself with people who have the same desire to study as I have. The other things that I like at AUCA are the extracurricular activities.

She also used to help her husband farm. \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy two calves that someone wants to sell her.

She is married to Eliseo, a pensioner, and they have children who are both working already. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMa. Dodgie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMa. Dodgie hopes to have more customers and dreams that her family will always be in good condition.

She was born under the roof of a loving family with strong principles.  From a young age she has always dreamt of being a nurse.  She is a girl who throws herself into something she is interested in, the well-being of others.  She would take pleasure in caring for them, caring for the patients and for herself, to manage to get a nice moment in life.  They could forget their illness for a minute and find a moment of relief and tranquility.\r\n\r\nDiana wants to be a nurse.  More than doing it for a salary or a paycheck, she is doing it as a calling.  Unfortunately, Diana was born to a family that, in spite of being loving, does not have enough financial resources to pay for a degree of this type.  Diana hasn\u2019t turned away from her dream of being a nurse because if she can dream it, she can make it come true.  No dream is only a dream.  She felt that something must be done to begin, so she decided to become a nurse technician.  In this way she can reach her final goal, because she was always a great student.  She couldn\u2019t allow her life to end with high school, so she looked for the best choice for making it happen: Campo Alto.  So, she adjusted the expectations that she had.  In spite of being an excellent school with the authority to do the training and adjusting itself to her budget, she still needed financial aid.  So she found herself needing to look for work to support herself and be able to reach her dreams: ending up as an excellent nurse who is always on the move and motivated from her love for her work and for her patients, making a nicer life for them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1512677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for registration for a semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T03:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T03:30:06Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":145762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069649},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":145762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882593},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":145762.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201957},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":291525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286098}],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T04:23:26Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":658601,"name":"Zubaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zubaida is a 31-year-old married woman who has been running a business selling milk for many years.

Nargizi's husband is unemployed nowadays and both are involved in agricultural activities. They take care of cattle and also cultivate nuts. The agricultural products are sold locally and the monthly income from this activity is 330 GEL. For further development of her agricultural activities Nargizi wants to purchase a stock of fruits and vegetables and start trading.

Her husband died from an illness, and Leyla raised the children by herself.  The oldest son is a shepherd and takes local residents' livestock to pasture for a set payment.  The second son works in Kazakhstan, and the daughter attends a technical college.  Leyla has a secondary education, and to provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 28 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Leyla's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 heifer, 5 sheep and also a 3.60 hectare land plot, where she grows clover, beans and barley. The monthly income amounts to 16,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Leyla requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls for fattening up and subsequent resale at a market at a high price. Leyla plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her son's wedding

He lives there with his wife and 14-year-old son. \n\nSamvel is a farmer with 30 years of experience. He runs a farm which includes livestock: chickens, turkeys, cows and calves. Near the village where they live, Samvel also owns arable land where he grows nuts, apples and pear trees. Samvel sells the gathered harvest in a nearby open market and earns income which is vital for his family's living. As there are no job opportunities in the village, locals here are mainly involved in agriculture. So for Samvel, this is also the main source of income and he works hard to gather a good harvest.\n\nNow for applying for this loan, Samvel is asking for financial support to be able to renovate his greenhouse and enlarge the cultivation process.  Samvel has already taken out a loan from local financial institutions before, but because of hard financial conditions wasn't able to pay it back on time. However, thanks to the hard work during recent times, he was able to run his farming in a way that it ensures stable financial income during the month. So, Samvel has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. The loan will greatly help Samvel and his family to overcome financial difficulties and continue expanding their farm.\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1512131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for renovation of the greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Malishka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T07:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T07:10:08Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samvel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":89.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":95.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":97.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":99.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":99.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":99.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":101.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":102.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":102.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":103.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":103.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":105.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":107.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":108.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":109.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":110.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":110.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":113.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":114.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.41},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":656073,"name":"Nazaire","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Nazaire est un homme de 48 ans, p\u00e8re de famille.

She sews fantastic national dresses for women. Nafisa has sewn since childhood. She has a talent for this. At a young age, she was an apprentice to a seamstress. There she learnt all details of this activity. \r\n\r\nWhen Nafisa started a family and gave birth to two children, the need for additional funds increased and she decided to open her own business. Her husband supported her in this business. After all, he is not indifferent to his family's future. In the beginning, Nafisa used an old sewing machine. Then she decided to purchase a new sewing machine and she purchased one of the brand \"Yamata\". \r\n\r\nDue to high competition and the family's increasing need for additional money, Nafisa would like to purchase an embroidery machine. With this, she and her small business will be able to \"survive\", and continue to service more customers, earning the necessary amount for the children's education and the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nNafisa very much hopes that the credit received will help her to move beyond this difficult time.

Thanks to her hard work, Lira today has on her farm: two dairy cows, one heifer, one calf, and eight sheep. Monthly income consists of 16,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her farm, Lira applied to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan - to purchase a horse
