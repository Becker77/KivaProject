He is one of three children and as he was growing up he realized how difficult the economic situation was for his mother, his twin brother and his eldest brother, who passed away.\r\n\r\nHis mother was 40 when he was born.  Her name was Graciela and she also passed away.  She used to work for a flower company but became ill after working there a long time.  The chemicals she handled in the company were blamed for her illness which had no cure.  Yeison Camilo had to face reality and became worried and anxious on seeing how much his mother suffered.  She also had a bad relationship with his father who never lived with them and never cared for them.\r\n\r\nWhen he was eight years old, his eldest brother died.  It was difficult for his mother to face this situation and she would weep every day.  But she was very strong and able to provide for her twin boys, getting them through grade school and high school before she died.\r\n\r\nMost of their lives, they lived in rental property and it was hard for his mother to pay the rent and support the children.  She was very responsible and paid the bills and stretched her income to support the two boys.  She gave them values and told them never to let bad friendships influence them.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan.

He wants to reduce his operating costs and sees his investment in a 40 cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester as an excellent opportunity. Using his biodigester, he will be able to turn the abundant cow manure generated daily on his farm into renewable energy and biofertilizer. He'll feed the system with manure and through a process of anaerobic digestion, the organic waste will be transformed into methane-rich, renewable biogas and potent organic fertilizer.

He is 48 years old, married and with 5 children, who he had brought up with a lot of effort and hard work. For the past 13 years, he has been working with crafts and primitive paintings. His family supports him and he works from Monday to Saturday from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm. Being a freelancer, he is able to manage his own time but his biggest challenge is that his sales are very unstable and his economy relies solely on this activity. Despite these challenges, he has been able to support his family. He is asking for this loan in order to purchase raw material (ceramics and painting products). Thanks to this loan, he will be able to stock up and increase his production. By doing that, he will be able to meet his current demand for products, which will allow him to improve the income that he receives for his work. Luis says that his main objective is to continue to grow his business and to achieve a better market position, which will allow him to make his dream of exporting his products come true and to ensure

She resides in a small house with her husband, one son of 16 years and one daughter of 12 years in a rural village named Chindaguda in the Nuapada district in Odisha, India.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten years, Gitanjali has run a general grocery shop in her small house with items like soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, oil, etc. She started the business with a small investment of her own. At that time, her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR. It was very difficult on her part to maintain the family. So she, with four other women of her village, formed a Joint Liability group named Jay Sriram to avail loans from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nTo date she has already availed three loans of 10,000, 14000 and 28,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation and has been able to expand her business. Now she is earning a monthly income of 5,000 INR. As per the statement of Gitanjali, this small income is not at all sufficient to manage the family along with educational expenses of her children, so she wants to increase her income by expansion of her existing business. \r\n\r\nShe has planned to use the loan amount to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently. She hopes that this investment will give her more income and  enough savings that she will be able to construct a house for her family, which is a dream for her, and give better education to the children. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Sushama, Himadri, Jasobanti and Labanidei, who are running milk selling, computer center, and vegetable vending businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"CHINDAGUDA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gitanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Himadri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasobanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Labanidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":152000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":152000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T01:18:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":658672,"name":"Maria Alejandra","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria alejandra es una estudiante de auxiliar judicial esta cursando tercer semestre, esta carrera t\u00e9cnica le ha servido para ampliar los conocimientos acerca de lo que ella le gustar\u00eda ejercer mas adelante que es investigaci\u00f3n judicial para poder tener mas oportunidad de colaborar con la familia ya que en este momento no cuenta con los requisitos econ\u00f3micos para terminar la carrera, debido a que el trabajo le suministra un salario con el cual puede cubrir los gastos de su casa y la cuota que estaba pagando anteriormente.\nLa carrera de investigaci\u00f3n judicial la desea terminar para tener una base solida para poder seguir con la carrera profesional y a si poder entrar a una entidad del estado como la polic\u00eda nacional, C.T.I  o la fiscalia, esta carrera le ha llamado la atenci\u00f3n ya que desde muy peque\u00f1a le ha gustado todo lo que tiene que ver con el campo de acci\u00f3n, de la investigaci\u00f3n criminal, como la criminalistica, medicina forense, derecho penal en fin, agradecer\u00eda la ayuda que kiva le puede dar para que pueda terminar y tener unos conocimientos mas profundos y claros acerca de lo que le apasiona.

Ademas, de sembrar 6 tareas de ma\u00edz, para el consumo de la familia. Toda la vida ha trabajo en la agricultura y gracias al apoyo de su esposa, han logrado sacar adelante a sus hijos, d\u00e1ndole la oportunidad de que estudien y se preparen academicamente. Ahora Antonio, produce 14,000 metros cuadrados de ma\u00edz y 7,000 de sorgo y el trabajo lo realiza junto a sus dos hijos, cuando ellos no asisten a  la escuela. El terreno esta casi un kil\u00f3metro de su casa y el recorrido lo hacen en caballo y trabajan de 6 am hasta la 1 pm. Ademas, cuando trabaja como jornalero, cuando hay trabajo en las zonas de ca\u00f1ales y algodoneras.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo sera invertido en la compra de dos novillas, con las cuales, Antonio espera dentro de dos a\u00f1os, que estas se reproduzcan y puedan aumentar el hato. Para luego tener el negocio de cri\u00e1 y engorde de ganado. Para as\u00ed, tener dos fuentes de ingreso y no depender en su totalidad de la agricultura.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Antonio es mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia, para que no les falte nada, por ello es necesario tener siempre salud, para realizar las labores diarias, para llevar a casa el sustento diario, el cual no debe faltar nunca. Antonio, tiene la ilusi\u00f3n de crecer en el negocio del ganado, para as\u00ed no depender solo de la siembra de ma\u00edz y sorgo, ya que muchas veces existen perdidas en los cultivos y es mas alto el riesgo de que en su hogar la alimentaci\u00f3n pueda faltar. Para sus hijos desea lo mejor y que sean personas honestas y responsables tal como \u00e9l les ha ense\u00f1ado.","en":"Antonio is forty-five years old.  Unfortunately, he did not attend school because his parents were very poor and they could not send him to school.  However, they instilled in him the desire to work, and he became a responsible and hardworking man.  He is in a common-law marriage, and his wife is a homemaker.  Together, they have two children.\r\n\r\nAntonio has worked ever since he has had a reason to.  He works with his father as a laborer on the lands and plantations, and also tends to six corn crops for his family's consumption.  For his entire life, he has been working in agriculture.  Thanks to the support of his wife, he has been able to move his children ahead, giving them the opportunity to study and to prepare themselves academically for the future.  \r\n\r\nAntonio now produces 14,000 square meters of corn and 7,000 square meters of sorghum.  He does this work together with his two children when they are not in school.  The land is almost a kilometer from their home, so they travel by horse and work from 6am until 1pm.  Antonio continues to work as a laborer when there is work on the sugar-cane and cotton plantations.\r\n\r\nHe will invest the loan in the purchase of two heifers; Antonio hopes that they will reproduce within two years and his herd will grow.  He hopes to eventually have a business raising and fattening livestock.  In this way, he will have two sources of income and he will not have to depend solely on agriculture.\r\n\r\nAntonio's dream is to improve his family's quality of life so that they never need anything.  He always needs to be healthy so that he can perform all his daily work, which brings the food to the table every day.  Antonio has a vision of growing his livestock business so that he doesn't have to only depend on the corn and sorghum crops; there are many times when there are losses in farming, and there is a high risk that his family's food intake will suffer.  \r\n\r\nHe wishes the best for his children, and hopes they grow as honest and responsible people, just as he has taught them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1513194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two heifers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1030,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1030}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":1030,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545731}],"funded_date":"2014-02-17T13:47:43Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":658677,"name":"Francisco Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Francisco de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, por sus escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos no tuvo mas que estudiar hasta sexto grado, pues \u00e9l era el mayor de los cuatro hermanos y ten\u00eda que ayudarle a sus padres a trabajar, ya que sus familia era muy pobre.

He lives in his father's home in the  Medine district of Bougouni.  \r\n\r\nMamadou is a refrigeration expert by trade. Wishing to expand the scope of his business, he decided to add on the purchase and resale of spare parts for refrigerators about 10 years ago.

Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nMary is a widow with five children.

One is outside of the country.\r\n\r\nPedro is a bricklayer, and he has been in this trade for 16 years.  He learned from a friend who took him to work as a helper.

He used the previous loans to buy a digital camera and photographing equipment. He is a hardworking man. He is so happy with a loan which has permitted him to get married and take care of his family. He managed to pay back all his loans successfully. He used his profits to buy a TV set, pay school fees and cover household expenses. He will use this loan to buy small items for the photography business. He dreams of living a good life with his family.\r\n\r\nJuston will share this loan with his loan group \"Mawela\" which has a total of ten members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5650,"image":{"id":1493259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy small items for the photography business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":5650,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juston","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yusuph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magreth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":9050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1004762.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1058073.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1074390.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1124910.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1148624.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1169846.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1226880.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1242512.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":627.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":660.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":670.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":702.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":730.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":765.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":627.28,"local_amount":1004762.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1005824.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439861686},{"amount":1108.97,"local_amount":1776312.34,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1778190.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449750739},{"amount":1091.98,"local_amount":1749108.31,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1750957.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459231370},{"amount":2046.06,"local_amount":3277304.43,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3280769.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468056711},{"amount":775.71,"local_amount":1242512.34,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1243826.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479274572}],"funded_date":"2013-12-20T16:59:51Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T20:58:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":647373,"name":"Sabo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sabo is married and has 2 children, who are adults.

This group was formed to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the expansion of existing businesses. \r\n\r\nJayanti, a simple and confident lady, is one of the members of this group. She hails from a poor family living below the poverty line. The lady standing third from the left in the photo and raising her hand is Jayanti. She is 34 years old and lives with her husband, one son of thirteen years, and two daughters of eleven and four years of age, in a small mud house. Her elder daughter and son are continuing their studies in the village school. \r\n\r\nJayanti has been running a tiffin stall with selling of eggs for the last five years in her village, with the hand-holding support of her husband. Jayanti prepares breakfast items like samosa, wada, potato chup (local names for different types of snacks), etc. Her stall is very popular due to good-quality items. She starts her tiffin stall at 8:00 a.m. in the morning and closes at 6:00 pm in the evening. \r\n\r\nDue to the rural base, she earns a little monthly income of 4,000 INR from the above business. With this small income, she is hardly able to manage her household and the educational expenses of her children. She had wanted to expand the business, but finance was a constraint for her. \r\n\r\nWhen she learned about Mahashakti Foundation, she joined in the group and has taken a loan of 10,000 INR for expansion of her business. With the present loan, Jayanti wants to purchase more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc. to increase the quantity of items. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she has to replenish her stock frequently from the nearest market of five kilometers away. \r\n\r\nJayanti hopes to save enough to construct a permanent cabin for her tiffin stall and construct a house for her family. \r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Banita, Sabhya, Bhagyabati, Indira and Phulmani, who are running a fruits stall, tea and tiffin stall, general store, dry food vending business, and tea stall respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for oil, dough, sugar, eggs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"CHANABEDA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T18:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T18:50:05Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Banita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagyabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabhya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phulmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":72000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-20T11:19:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":656702,"name":"Tugiribirama Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fulgence fait partie du groupe  Tugiribirama  et habite \u00e0  Bubanza.

His business is located in an urban area which is productive with less competition, and his primary customers are the general public.\r\n\r\nHe describes his biggest business challenge to be a lack of enough capital to buy more stock. He will use the 50,000 KES loan to add stock of mobile phones and phone accessories.

financial help of Kiva. Due to the increase in production and the consistently high quality of production of his goods, Viktor has loyal customers. In particular, one private hotel became a regular customer, making him regular orders. Viktor in turn could then begin to make more complicated furniture, and of a better quality. Due to the regular income, Viktor was able to buy a home and make repairs there. The biggest difficult for Viktor is with personnel; it is difficult to train subordinates, to teach them and to achieve the required quality.<br \/><br \/>This time, Viktor applied for a sum of 8,000 hryvnia to acquire a compact machine for cabinet furniture and wardrobes. The purchase of this machine will help Viktor's business not only to start producing even more complication furniture constructions, but also to speed up order

He is pictured here in a group of eight One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 87 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Amos has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving one-quarter acre of maize and one-quarter acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nAmos is married and has three children. He is 25 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Amos has been a farmer for eight years. Amos described his harvest as good last year, but he believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nAmos first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Amos joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer, and hybrid seeds. He also wants to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, is an active community member, wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.\r\n\r\nAmos and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is one additional group leader in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1489569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T19:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T19:30:24Z","loan_amount":5375,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zipporah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sussy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":465363,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465363}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5375,"local_amount":465363,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":465367.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722900}],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T23:31:13Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":647536,"name":"Junior","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Junior vive en la ciudad de Chiclayo, ciudad de clima c\u00e1lido y amable.

He does not have any schooling because of scant economic resources. He lives with his life partner who works doing the chores of the house and the two kids, both of which are studying.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he makes his living planting corn and sorghum and has done this since he was a boy, since his father taught him this work. In those days, they didn't have any other way to survive except agriculture. In addition to working in agriculture, he works buying and selling pigs and cattle. He gets up at 4:00 AM and has to go to the country where he has a cornfield. He makes a journey of some 6 kilometers by bicycle; he does not have a leaving time until he finishes doing what he has planned for that day. He returns to his house and his eldest son helps in the time when he is not studying.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from the loan to sow 7,000 square meters of corn, since this month they begin to prepare the land for cultivation.

Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 100 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nDaniel is 59 years old and has been working as a farmer for 10 years to provide for his four children. The community and other farmers know Daniel as friendly and trustworthy. He is also involved in his community with the men's group, prayer group and burial committee.  Daniel described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nDaniel joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  He joined in order to get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. He also wants to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  \r\n\r\nBecause he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Daniel has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Daniel's life because he has been able to save money and feed his family.  In the future, Daniel hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and buy a cow.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Daniel and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are two additional group leaders shown in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is shown standing on the left.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6200,"image":{"id":1489434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":6200,"lender_count":197,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvester","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaudencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":534900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":6200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":6200,"local_amount":534900,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":536795.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722902}],"funded_date":"2014-01-31T01:30:13Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":647399,"name":"Seryozha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seryozha is 45 years old, married, and has two adult children.

She does not have a husband, but she has a daughter whom she takes care of and supports through her work.  Her daughter, who is 3 years old, lives with her and does not yet attend school. \r\n\r\nMartha has a tailor shop that she set up in her house.  She has been doing this work for two years, recently completing two years of training as a dressmaker, which has enabled her to dedicate herself to this occupation.  Also, her circumstances have not allowed her to find a better-paying job, and this is how she and her daughter survive.   As part of her business she works with two people, whom she is teaching dressmaking.  The work schedule varies according to demand, but the work day is normally about 6 hours. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is seeking is for the purchase of fabric to make clothing designs that are in demand in the community. She is well-known, since she is the only person who has learned how to do this work, and people seek her out.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help her to earn more income, since she will be able to fulfill her demand; and this will translate into well-being for her daughter, as she will be able to provide for her basic needs.\r\n\r\nMartha\u2019s dream for her business is to open her own shop in the city, and she says that she would like to become a businesswoman. She hopes that her business will grow until she has her own dressmaking school where she will teach anyone who wants to learn this profession.\r\n\r\nHer desire for her family is that her daughter

materials that she needs in order to sell her garments.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1513241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable

He brought with him a truck and decided to run a farming business. His farm currently includes chickens, pigs and cows and also cultivates wheat, barley and different fruits. Hrayr takes the gathered harvest to the open market and sells it. Agriculture is currently his only source of income so Hrayr works hard to gather enough income for his family.\r\n\r\nNow, Hrayr is applying for a USD 2000 loan to purchase forage for feeding his livestock and seeds for cultivation. He will be very thankful to Kiva lenders for the loan. \r\n\r\nAs this is Hrayr's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. This first-chance loan program provides loans to people who did not previously have access to credit products due to a lack of credit history.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1493379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for forage for feeding his livestock and seeds for cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Lernavan village, Lori region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T20:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T20:30:21Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hrayr","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":28,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":102.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":105.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":109.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":110.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":110.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":111.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":112.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":113.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":114.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":116.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":117.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":118.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":119.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Samantha Richardson","image":1220261}},{"id":647412,"name":"Soqatra Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Soqatra, and is made up of five ladies.

In the year 2009, five women from the weaving and cloth business community stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their families with their contributions. They formed a group named Sri Purusottam to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their existing businesses. Since then, the group has already taken four loans from  Mahashakti Foundation and has successfully repaid the loans. \r\n\r\nDamayanti is the one standing in front with her hand raised in the photo. She is 25 years old and lives with her husband and two sons of 12 and 9 years old. Damayanti hails from a traditional cloth weaving community. She has been running a cloth weaving & selling business with her husband. Presently, she has two hand looms for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader 20 km away from her village. They knit 80 to 100 pieces from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. She only produces saris because of the demand in the market. Damayanti makes two pieces of sari per day. Apart from this, she also purchases ready made garments from the local market. Her husband goes to weekly markets to sell the clothes. From this business, she earns a monthly income of Rs 7,000, which is not sufficient to make her future dream materialize.

She works as a seamstress in a textile factory. She is married and has two adult children. Since both children had to go to school, all of the family's money was used to pay those expenses. Their house has needed repairs for a long time. The family needs 11,000 hryvnia to replace the roof of the house. Now the family doesn't have to pay for the children's education because they are grown up and have their own families, but they still do not have enough money to repair the house. Anjelika's husband used to work a lot, but then he got sick and only receives a pension now. Therefore, the family really hopes for additional financial assistance through Kiva, because it is critical for them.

Presently, she is earning a monthly income of 8,000 INR, but according to her, this is not sufficient to make her dream materialize. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. So the present loan of 14,000 INR will be used to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she will replenish her stock frequently. Saudamini hopes to save enough to give a better education to her daughters. She also hopes for decent marriages for her daughters. She expresses her satisfaction that she has achieved total success due to the timely support of Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Sasamita, Sabetri, Lata and Jambubati who are running a general grocery shop, a seasonal products procurement business, a puffed rice business and a milk-selling business, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"LACHHIPUR, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sasamita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabetri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saudamini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jambubati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":66000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T23:00:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":647422,"name":"Zohrak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zorhak lives in Zovaber Village in Gegharkunik region.

lives in Sindo, a small town in Homa Bay County. Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nHenry is married and has eight children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for 30 years now. They are currently growing beans, millet, and maize and raising livestock on their farm. Henry is excited about beekeeping as the honey produced will be a source of food and medicine for his family and it will also earn him extra income.\r\n\r\nThis is Henry\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He is interested in working with Honey Care because they are keen in keeping their promises. He intends to use the income generated from his beekeeping to pay school fees for some orphans he is taking care of and to provide for their basic needs. Henry\u2019s hope for the future is to expand his beekeeping project and to teach others about beekeeping."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":20.1,"image":{"id":1484544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

is the sole owner of Best Shears Inc., a barber shop and beauty salon supplier of shears, scissors, dryers and other small appliances for the hair salon industry. Mohammad is originally from Pakistan where he and his son-in-law have a small factory that produces shears and scissors. In 2005, he incorporated Best Shears Inc. and started distributing shears and scissors to barber shops. Originally the business intended to exclusively distribute shears and scissors made in their Pakistani factory. However, the company has expanded beyond their own factory to include products made in other factories. In 2010, the business generated $100,000 in sales. This year, Mohammad opened a store front. Having a store front has allowed Mohammad to offer a greater selection to his clients as well as be able to sharpen blades on-site, which is a service he would like to provide in the future.

She hopes to get this loan because at the moment, she does not have the resources for the expense but she does have the capacity to make the monthly payments on the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1493618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase: galvanized metal sheets, wood and nails to repair the roof on her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":34.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":38.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":43.61},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":49.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":31.67,"processed_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":31.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450362712},{"amount":32.7,"local_amount":32.7,"processed_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":32.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459011883},{"amount":33.76,"local_amount":33.76,"processed_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T09:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":33.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467822672},{"amount":34.86,"local_amount":34.86,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":34.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479370453},{"amount":35.99,"local_amount":35.99,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-19T08:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":35.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491253241},{"amount":115.15,"local_amount":115.15,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530493393},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":40.91,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-19T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":543041966},{"amount":177.35,"local_amount":177.35,"processed_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T10:49:43Z","rounded_local_amount":177.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611988215},{"amount":97.61,"local_amount":97.61,"processed_date":"2015-05-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":97.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649504009}],"funded_date":"2013-12-20T20:35:15Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:29:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Roberto Henry"}},{"id":659059,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is a 44-year-old single woman.

fulfilled by his interactions with customers. Unfortunately, Joshua was laid off shortly afterwards. However, having realized his passion and discovering that there was only one distributor in his area, Joshua decided to establish Ecstatic Stone, a wholesale distributor of natural stone in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I first began in the stone industry, I was told that once a person starts working in the industry, they rarely ever leave. I soon learned what was meant by that statement: the granite, marble, onyx, and other natural stones I saw everyday are such amazing creations of nature. It is beautiful stuff. It is art, but it is also very real and has very practical uses.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt Ecstatic Stone, Joshua imports high quality stones from places like Brazil, India, Nepal, and Italy. He is also conveniently located for local businesses since Ecstatic Stone is the only stone distributor available in a 1.5 hour radius.\r\n\r\nThe future of Ecstatic Stone certainly looks bright, but Joshua needs your help to take the business to the next level. With this loan, Joshua will purchase more products and warehouse equipment that he will use to move and secure stone slabs.\r\n\r\nWhat does he see in Ecstatic Stone\u2019s future?  \u201cBeing very passionate about my work, creative, and imaginative, I envision Ecstatic Stone taking on these characteristics, setting it apart from other stone distributors. I see us as being the best, offering the best, and demanding the best,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nHelp out this small business owner today and check out his business here: http:\/\/www.ecstaticstone.com\/

Coffee prices are volatile and their income depends on a good harvest that must withstand problems from pest or frosts. Catalina works at house carrying firewood to cook their food and sometimes she dyes clothes to earn more money. \n\nTheir community in southern Mexico is made up of only 1,262 inhabitants. According to government statistics, most people here do not speak spanish well and have very low incomes.\n\nThey live in a one room house made of sheet and wood and that has an open bonfire. They often get sick and have respiratory problems because of the smoke in their house. In the winter, it is cold and so they usually catch the flu. Furthermore, there are some animals that come inside the house to eat their food or to hurt their children and themselves.\n\nHabitat for Humanity is a nonprofit international organization founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe and affordable place to live. Habitat for Humanity Mexico works in communities with groups who build through mutual help and a self-construction system where the families need to participate in workshops and trainings about building, healthy housing and financial education, this aiming to develop and strength their capacities. In M\u00e9xico, works since 1989 and today more than 7,000 families have been served just on the last 3 years. This family works with the community committees as they have seen; it gives more and better

who has been doing livestock for nearly 10 years; he sells the raw milk to a nearby dairy farm. \r\n\r\nHe and his family literally fall below the poverty level, and to add to their poverty this past month, they were asked to pay a farmer's contribution as others do in such similar activities. \r\n\r\nIn Albania, there is a law that all 'active individuals'. including self-employed farmers, must contribute into the social insurance scheme.  \r\n\r\nFarmers and others who are self-employed pay a fixed sum, as well as a set amount of their profits. The contributions are 'registered', but immediately pay out benefits to those who are retired or have disabilities.  Benefits for those paying in now are paid for by the younger generation of workers.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Veledin is requesting a loan for the very first

Priscillah has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative, and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised.  \r\n\r\nFarming inputs will be delivered to her and the other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. (67 individual farmers in total are represented by this group).\r\n\r\nPriscillah is 45 years old, and has been a farmer for six years to provide for her six children.  The community and other farmers know Priscillah as friendly and hard-working.  Other than farming, she is also involved in community activity, such as the women's group.  Priscillah described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nPriscillah joined One Acre Fund in 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Priscillah joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  Because she is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, Priscillah has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Priscillah's life because she has more farm training, and has more farm group support.  She was also able to save money and feed her family.  In the future, Priscillah hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to save for the future, and to buy a cow.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.

has a grand idea, to organize a new business. Manzura is 29 years old. She is married, but does not have children. She decided to establish a business sewing women's clothing, since she learned while still in her parents' home how to sew women's clothing. <br \/><br \/>She has long been looking for help and finally, she learned about the course \"Bring on Success\" organized by the Association of Business Women. She took part in the course and received a lot of good things for herself.

","en":"Monica is 46 years old and the mother of a four-year-old child. She lives with her son in the south of the city. She has had a sewing workshop in her home for 13 years, where she sews women's, men's and children's clothing. She was very young, 14 years old, when she began to work at a workshop, completing a variety of different tasks. This is where she learned this activity, guided by the owner of the business, who saw that Monica was inspired and had a lot of potential as a seamstress. Little by little, Monica learned from her. After that, Monica trained for three years at an academy to develop better skills. She learned sewing techniques until she had to begin to work from home in order to care for her ill father. <br \/><br \/>Given this situation, she became independent and began her own entrepreneurial adventure. Today she makes blouses, pants, and bermuda shorts, all from her own home. That's where her customers come to buy things and use her sewing services.<br \/><br \/>Every day it takes more and more in order to compete in the sewing business, and although Monica has mastered the diverse techniques involved sewing, she hasn't managed to break into the wholesale market because of a lack of infrastructure. Being a wholesale provider is currently the most profitable way of making a living in this field. This is the reason why Monica is currently requesting a Kiva loan. This will be her first funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to purchase a sewing machine, an industrial serger, and a cover-stitch machine.

Another objective that he has besides studying with great determination is to get a job during his free time so he can support his commitment towards formation, increase his personal growth and support his family, especially his parents. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1513407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay his tuition fee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-19T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janner Stiven ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069655},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882599},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201963},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286104},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224811}],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T03:30:17Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marila Arana","image":1590928}},{"id":647545,"name":"Mausauri","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mausauri  continua con la venta de \u00fatiles de escritorio por lo tanto en esta oportunidad requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar mercader\u00eda como por ejemplo cuadernos, lapiceros, papeles y otras cosas m\u00e1s, \u00e9l agradece a quienes forman parte de este sue\u00f1o mediante este medio pues valora el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas mensuales con mucha responsabilidad. \u00c9l pertenece al banco Comunal \u201cSan Martincito\u201d de la Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa de la ciudad de Paucartambo.","en":"Mausauri continues to sell stationary items and he needs a loan to buy merchandise such as notebooks, mechanical pencils, paper, and other things.

has been a Senior Legal Assistant in New York City for almost ten years. However, she has always had a creative and unusual sense of style, and when she woke up one day and realized that it was time to start working towards her dream of becoming her own boss, she relied on her knack for creative design.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Dekeisha established OseiLei, a kitchenware and home goods company that features products that have a more creative, unique, and unconventional design than traditional cookware items. \r\n \r\n\u201cI have eccentric taste, and I felt that many people, including myself, were lacking cool, never-seen-before, and affordable household gadgets. Therefore, I decided it was time to create something durable, affordable, and chic for consumers to use in their kitchens.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor Dekeisha, who is married and has a daughter, her highest priority is to have a happy and healthy family, and having a profitable, successful business is one way to ensure that. With this loan, Dekeisha will build prototypes for her kitchenware designs. With these prototypes, she will be able to showcase her creations at tradeshows and attract investors and market her products for future manufacturing. \r\n\r\nDekeisha hopes that her story will inspire others to live their dreams by showing them that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. \r\n\r\nHelp her support her family and move closer to her dream.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5375,"image":{"id":1492316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She was born and raised in the town of Isfara. She got married at an early age. But she and her husband did not live together for long since their characters did not agree and after the birth of their child they decided to separate. She was tired of the endless quarrels. Muhabbat left him, and began life on her own. At the beginning, it was very hard for her with a little one to care for. But later she found herself work. Now, she buys and sells dried fruits in the local markets. And at night she sews national dresses.<br \/><br \/>After she bought a new apartment, Muhabbat renovated it and now with the approaching winter she wants to put up plastic doors and windows. Muhabbat decided to turn to the organization Arvand for material support, since she did not have sufficient funds. With the loan received, Muhabbat wants to buy windows and doors and to install them in her home. She thanks Arvand in advance for the help and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1487019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic windows and doors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-20T00:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T00:50:05Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":891.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":914.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":936.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":960.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":984.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1008.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1034.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1060.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1086.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1113.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1139.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2525,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12052.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144401}],"funded_date":"2014-02-17T17:01:04Z","paid_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":647661,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelina is 48 years old.
