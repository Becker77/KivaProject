For her part, she promises to be punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nWith the amount that she has requested, she will purchase cookies, candies, cereals, fruit, purple corn, gelatin, flan, flour, milk, butter, eggs, and everything that is necessary to continue making the desserts that she sells in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1513413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cookies, candies, eggs, and other similar items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2014-01-19T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":190.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":197.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":199.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":220.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.19,"local_amount":179.16,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-15T13:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":188.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450599013},{"amount":71.52,"local_amount":190.72,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-02T10:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":200.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459147905},{"amount":74.19,"local_amount":197.84,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":208.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468241003},{"amount":32.44,"local_amount":86.5,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-04T11:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":91.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258440},{"amount":122,"local_amount":325.35,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-01T11:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":342.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491502510},{"amount":82.66,"local_amount":220.43,"processed_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-25T12:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":232.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504306443}],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T10:38:33Z","paid_date":"2015-07-25T12:10:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":658772,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Elenilson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJos\u00e9,  estudio hasta  noveno  grado de nivel acad\u00e9mico,  est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado su esposa se dedica a los quehaceres del hogar.\n\nJos\u00e9 trabaja como vendedor de hamacas, jugueteras y equipos de sonido cuando le encargan y varios electrodom\u00e9sticos  para el hogar desde hace 3 a\u00f1os ; este trabajo lo aprendi\u00f3 de un cu\u00f1ado que antes vend\u00eda estos productos y viendo la posibilidad de \u00e9l de seguir el negocio y sabiendo que esto le generaba ingresos decidi\u00f3 seguirlo y ponerlo en pr\u00e1ctica .

He is in a common-law relationship and his wife performs the household chores.  For three years, Jos\u00e9 has worked as a salesman of hammocks, toys, sound equipment on order, and various home appliances.  He learned this business from a brother-in-law that used to sell these products. He looked at the possibility of carrying on the business and he knew that it was generating income, so he decided to pursue the idea and put it into practice.  The job is two hours away and he goes out selling in the neighboring cantons.  He made his first investment with the help of the loans and sees that it is better to be able to buy more and it helps to better invest his money in the business.  He goes out on his own to sell, and his wife stays home and if someone is looking for a small thing, she sells it there.  Jos\u00e9 leaves home at 7:00 in the morning and gets home at 4:00 in the afternoon. When business goes well, he sells everything and then comes home.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting the loan to purchase seven hammocks that were ordered, a toy, and a bed that the neighbors had ordered.  This is how he will invest the money, and thus earn profits.  He also leaves home appliances on credit and then, on a designated day, he stops by homes collecting the money.  The profits will be invested in more things that he needs, and this will greatly improve his life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1513418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She is making good money from selling and she wants to apply for a bigger loan in the future. \r\n\r\nAlgira is living in a town near by the school; her kiosk is located in a strategic place where many people come to buy, including students. She is happy with this loan because it is offered to poor people to improve their living conditions in the future.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cAUCA is the best university in Central Asia. It offers instruction for different professions. Classes are taught only in English, which encourages me to attend AUCA more. I am a winner of a FLEX program and had a great experience during my studies in America. \r\n\r\nAccording to AUCA students, professors give assignments to them that increase their knowledge of the business world and expand their horizons. When I was an exchange student, I took business administration credits. For the longest time, it was hard to decide whether my future profession is in public speaking or in business. Indeed, business administration includes both of them. Any business will not succeed without public speaking skills. \r\n\r\nAUCA will help me to meet my goals. Kyrgyzstan\u2019s economy is very low compared to other countries. In my opinion, we need to build business not only within the country, but also need to build partnerships with different countries as well. I have a goal \u2013 I hope to run a business between three countries: Kyrgyzstan, USA and China. \r\n\r\nCompared to USA, AUCA has similar methods of education. Besides, AUCA does lots of extracurricular activities, such as flash mobs, volunteering projects and orientation weeks. Volunteering is a common thing in the US. However, it is not that developed in our country. In addition, while attending school in the US, I was on the honor roll for the entire year. \r\n\r\nI would also like to mention that AUCA not only educates it students on the top level, but also gives them financial support, so that they could make their dreams come true. I also want to apply for the loan and cover my tuition fees. The loan is given by Kiva.\u201d\r\n

He is single, and lives with his father, his mother, and two brothers. \r\n\r\nHe has worked as a salesman in a store in the city for 4 years.  He learned this work on his own-- he decided to look for a job upon finishing school because he needed employment, and he was given the opportunity to work in this store.  His job is about 45 minutes from his house, and he takes the bus to work.  His schedule at the store is from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan in order to purchase a motorcycle to get from his job to his home because the bus that he takes is no longer running when he leaves work, and he has to travel in other cars that go to the neighborhood where his house is located.  They drop him off on a crossroad, and then he has to walk; but he is afraid to travel this way because of the crime.\r\n\r\nThis is why he wants to buy a motorcycle--having his own transportation, he will leave work later, and thus he will be able to make more commissions. \r\n \r\nOne of his dreams is to study and prepare himself so that in the future he can have his own store. This is helping him to be knowledgeable about the products--when he has his own business, the more he knows, the more he will sell. \r\n\r\nHe will make a great effort to achieve this, so that he will be able to help his parents. They worked very hard to give him an education, and he wants to repay their efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1513423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal

It is made up of nine members and is directed by a board of directors, of which Alejandra is President. The businesses that the members of the communal bank take on are varied. Between themselves there are: a grocery store, the knitting of sweaters, shoes sales, the sale of replacement parts for cars, juice sales, the sewing of bedspreads and vegetable sales. \r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit small microenterprises of which Alejandra is a member. She has indicated that she joined Pro Mujer ten years ago, being admitted upon visiting the institution and observing that everything they offered her was favorable for her family. Currently she has a business selling juice. She says that she learned this business from observing that it was profitable. Furthermore, she had the tools to go to market. \r\n\r\nThe loan that Alejandra will take out now is for increasing capital (by the purchase of wholesale fruit) that she will acquire from the outdoor markets in the city of El Alto and afterwards will sell in her sales space. This way of work allows her to generate resources to maintain her home as much as possible, because she is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen Alejandra is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the savings that the institution offers her.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1513439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-01-19T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albertina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27756,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3680},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3753.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3854.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3960.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4068.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4179.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4258.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":533.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":544.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":559.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":574.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":590.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":606.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":617.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":533.65,"local_amount":3680,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3687.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641994},{"amount":544.35,"local_amount":3753.8,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3761.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108932},{"amount":559.01,"local_amount":3854.88,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3862.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923983},{"amount":574.32,"local_amount":3960.44,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3968.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144829},{"amount":590.03,"local_amount":4068.8,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4077.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838558},{"amount":606.07,"local_amount":4179.4,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4187.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264591},{"amount":617.57,"local_amount":4258.68,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:00:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4267.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546709}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T20:35:29Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T12:00:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyssa Hopun","image":1287558}},{"id":659100,"name":"Nely","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nely helps her husband with their own farm, planting different kinds of crops in order to make a living.

The children work at a market and help the parents financially.  Oroskul has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 14 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Oroskul's hard work, today her business contains 4 dairy cows and also a small land plot, wher she plants perennial herbs and sunflower (seeds).  After picking the sunflower harvest (seeds), she processes it and makes sunflower oil for personal consumption.  Oroskul has all of the necessary conditions for keeping livestock.  They prepare hay and feed for the winter by themselves.  The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Oroskul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows for fattening up and subsequent resale at a market at a high price.

Currently they're striving to give their children a better future.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's the coordinator thanks to her effort and a desire to get ahead.  Her business is a \"pulper\u00eda,\" a small grocery store that sells small quantities of food such as rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, detergent, oil, matches, eggs, juice, and soda.  She works about 12 hours a day, and does so with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Mar\u00eda's loan is to invest in working capital and buy and sell food products to stock her store so she can earn more income in the near future.\r\n\r\nLas Mariposas Communal Bank is grateful for the help that Kiva lenders give to low-income people and poor countries such as Nicaragua so they have the means to

He lives with his mother. Gevorg and his mother work in the government sector. Both of them work hard to be able to earn a living, but unfortunately their salaries are so low that they cannot afford a good living based on those salaries alone. To be able to cover the needs of his family Gevorg is engaged in breeding pigs and piglets, and in cultivation of grass. He sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is an important source of his family's income. His mother assists him greatly in his everyday activities related to farming. To continue running his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Gevorg needs to make some investments in the business. A loan of USD 1500 will help him greatly, enabling him to purchase six new piglets, and to buy some forage for the livestock. Gevorg and his mother rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will be grateful to them for their help in maintaining and developing their agribusiness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":904.2,"image":{"id":1482078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

As the family's needs are increasing day by day, and their life is getting even more expensive Anyuta wants to expand her agribusiness in order to more effectively meet the family's needs. A loan of $2,000 will be a huge help to this hard-working woman and her family enabling her to purchase materials (cellophane and pipes) for greenhouse construction and to buy fertilizers. Anyuta and her family rely on the good will of the lenders and will be thankful to them for their support in collecting the needed amount of this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1488558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She learned this business for many years from her father, and it later became a family business. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to increase her capital and purchase construction materials and metals, which she will buy from Bolivian importers and later sell in her store.  This type of work allows her to generate income to support her household, since she is single and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes best about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the health trainings and the loans.\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5550,"image":{"id":1513449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase construction materials and metals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-01-19T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":5550,"lender_count":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Esthela\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima Gladys\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernesto\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":38256,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5034.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5171.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5311.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5457.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5606.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5758.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5916.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":730.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":770.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":791.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":813.31},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":835.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":858.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":730.33,"local_amount":5034.12,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5046.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641995},{"amount":750.31,"local_amount":5171.88,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5184.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108933},{"amount":770.62,"local_amount":5311.88,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923984},{"amount":791.71,"local_amount":5457.2,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5470.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144830},{"amount":813.31,"local_amount":5606.16,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5620.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838559},{"amount":1693.72,"local_amount":11674.76,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11703.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264592}],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T10:39:09Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T13:16:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":643482,"name":"Mujeres So\u00f1adoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Irene es una de las cuatro mujeres emprendedoras de negocio que forman el grupo de mujeres so\u00f1adoras, tiene 37 a\u00f1os, casada, con tres hijos de 20, 14 y 4 a\u00f1os de edad, su negocio es la venta de ropa nueva desde hace a\u00f1o y medio.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n \u201cI chose the Department of International and Business Law for several reasons. I have always wanted to link my future life to jurisprudence and to become a judge. Given the shortcomings of the legal system in the Kyrgyz Republic, I believe that there is a need for professional, young, creative and honest lawyers in order to function in an increasingly complex and globalized world. Certainly it is not easy to be a professional and successful lawyer. You must have the necessary qualities such as perseverance, leadership, an analytical mind, and a willingness to study hard. During high school I tried to develop these qualities, and I learned teamwork, dedication, perseverance, honesty, and hard work. I learned English, because it is the language of international communication. I was an active member of the debate club, where we learned to argue and clearly express our opinions. I consider it my civic duty to contribute to the development of the legal system in the Kyrgyz Republic, and to the facilitation of entrepreneurship and economic growth in general. I also want to provide for my family, and make sure that they are able to live a good life.\u201d\r\n\r\nUlan is requesting a loan to pay for his higher

In most universities, students have to choose their future profession when they finish high school. AUCA is the only university in the country where you can try different subjects and decide later what your future profession will be. I think that I like business, but I also want to try some courses in political science and in psychology.\r\n\r\n\"In high school I did not work as hard as I should have, and I think that I missed some opportunities to learn interesting things. Now that I have the chance to study at AUCA, I am going to be a much more serious student, and also participate in all of the student life activities at the university. I especially want to take part in all of the football tournaments, and also some volunteering activities to help motivate other young students to study and work

It is made up of eight members and led by a board of directors of which Paulina is the president. The businesses that the members have in the group are varied. Among them are: artisanal crafts, embroidering, a butcher shop, baby clothing, a telephone booth service, and weaving blankets. \r\n\r\nThe loan they will take out will benefit the small businesswomen, including Paulina. She says that she has been in Pro Mujer for five years. She joined at the invitation of a counselor of the institution who went to visit her in her house. Right now, she has a business selling meat. She says that she acquired this business, already running, because a cousin who travelled to another country transferred it to her.\r\n \r\nThe loan she will take out now is to increase capital by buying meat wholesale. She will acquire it from the communities in the La Paz department and later she will sell it in her locale. This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her family, since she is married and has two children.   \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the areas of credit, health and training that the institution offers. \r\n\r\nIn the image there is a woman accompanying them. She is wearing a black hat.

beneficial and the only thing that mattered was work.  He is married and his wife works in the home.  His children are already married.\r\n\r\nHe buys and sells corn and beans and has been doing this for 15 years. He learned this because he used to work in farming but he didn\u2019t make much money and this drove him to start this business.  He doesn\u2019t have a fixed schedule, but goes out at 5:00 am and goes through all the neighborhoods in town, buying corn and beans by the quintal and taking them to sell to the stores in town.  He travels about 50 km per day in a little truck and his son helps him; this is all the help he has.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan to buy grain in quantity because there are times when he doesn\u2019t have enough cash to buy more.

She is married and has five children, four of whom attend school. Her fifth child is still too young to enroll. To help support her family, she went into business in 2011 with $150 in working capital. She will use this loan to buy various items to sell in her store such as chicken, beef, eggs and buckets.

She got help from a friend with a children\u2019s clothing store who contacted her.  This generated income that she invested into her business.  Currently her main products are boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 clothing, which she designs, prepares, makes, and finishes in her shop and sells on credit.  She buys her supplies in cash from large fabric suppliers who specialize in clothes making supplies.  Her future goals are to expand her workshop, improve her items, and increase her sales to generate more income and improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason that she requested a Kiva loan, her first through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Fredah has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 49 other individual farmers in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of KSH 5349 shillings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nFredah is a reliable member of the community. She is married with 3 children. Fredah is 30 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 2 years to support her family. In addition to this, Fredah is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group. She described her harvest last year as good. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe 2013 long rains season won\u2019t be Fredah\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  She first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, and get new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. As an active member in her community, Fredah also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Fredah plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school and invest in a business. Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more farm training and is able to feed the family.\t\t\t\n\nFredah and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

She is from the city of Estel\u00ed and makes a living running a convenience store. Starting with a small amount of savings four years ago, Magaly began buying a few products at a time and gradually building her business. She later applied for and received a loan to help with her business endeavor, and her next goal is to save up money to purchase a refrigerator so she can significantly broaden the variety of goods she offers to her customers.\r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan, Magaly plans to purchase merchandise to stock her store, including: soft drinks, rice, candy, bread, oil, soap and other products. She hopes this investment will help her to keep up with increasing client demand, strengthen her business and increase sales and overall profits.

Monthly income amounts to 16,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Zamira turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cows for fattening and subsequent sale at the market at a premium. <br \/><br \/>Zamira plans to invest income from the loan in further propagation of the quantity of domestic animals, and intends to save money to put on a wedding celebration for her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1494262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Joosh village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-20T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":135.63,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1324.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1324.07,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":65239.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178390},{"amount":1290.3,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":70257.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":135.63,"payment_id":595435932}],"funded_date":"2014-02-17T16:19:41Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":647788,"name":"Kipkoech","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Kipkoech.

At this time, she is working hard to sustain their financial expenses.\r\n\r\nZenaida is a coconut vendor. Most coconuts in the Philippines are sold by street vendors pushing wooden carts. The coconuts are served two different ways: either one end of it is cut and a straw is put in it to serve as the container itself or coconuts can be offered with the juice and the edible part of the coconut put into a plastic container with a straw. Regular customers are those who are thirsty and those who want to refresh themselves from the heat of the sun. They earn a minimum of 300 Php per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 18,000 Php loan. She will use the loan to buy tires for the cart, wood, coconuts, and a cooling container. \r\n\t\r\nZenaida hopes that her business will continue to be successful. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband is a security guard by profession, but his monthly income is not enough to cover the household expenses of his family. Therefore, for the past four years, while he works as  security guard, he also drives a rickshaw at night. But currently he is not able to generate any income from the rickshaw, as its engine is not working properly and needs to be repaired. Irum has applied for a loan from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan to borrow the amount needed to repair the engine. With the profit, her husband wants to buy a taxi in the future. Irum desires to provide a quality education to her all children, and she prays for the good health of her family and for the growth of her husband's business.

17, 15, 10 and 5. He is a teacher and a businessman who deals in agricultural produce. He has been in this business since 2009. The main reason he started the business was to diversify his income-generating activities.
