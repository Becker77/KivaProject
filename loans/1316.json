Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, and borders onto Lake Victoria, the second-largest lake in the world. Populations are dense close to the lake, where many individuals make their living from fishing, and a few work in the small but slowly growing tourism industry. A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nRichard is married and has nine children. His wife runs a small business. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for about thirty years. They are currently growing beans and finger millet in their farm. Richard is looking forward to keeping bees as it will be an opportunity for him to earn extra income.\r\n\r\nThis is Richard\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He is interested in working with Honey Care as it will help him in accessing beehives for the production of honey. He intends to use the proceeds from his beehives to start a small business.

She and her husband have been farming seaweed for 15 years now. They farm in the town of Talibon, Bohol. Seaweed is used in making kitchen wares such as basins and others.

Her mother lived with him for 5 years, then left him because he made their lives miserable. He didn't provide food and maltreated them. Her mother married another anew, taking Yuri with her to live with another gentleman who apparently loved them. After 6 long years, however, this relationship became difficult due to bad intentions.\r\n\r\nYuri, at just 13 years of age, decided to take charge of her own life with the help of her maternal grandmother. She was obliged to leave her studies in school and go to work for a year. Then she enrolled to study anew, completing the 2 years she lacked (11th and 12th). She used money she earned to pay for supplies, uniforms, and tuition, and had an agreement with her boss concerning hours of work. But after a time, her boss stopped offering her work. She continued to study with what little help her grandmother could provide, managing to complete high school. \r\n\r\nYuri decided to try her luck in [Bogota], the largest city in 2006. By this time she was 16 years old. Her intention was to work but this was more complicated than in the previous city. But still, she gained employment with a friend who had a small shop that sold caps and belts. Through this activity, she met the man who is now her husband. Her hopes were to continue studying because it has always been clear that this is the only thing that could help her to advance. She enrolled in an institute and studied for a semester to be a secretary. But she had to withdraw when she became pregnant and the pregnancy was at high risk. She remained at home with the father of the child and became a housewife. She could not study for the lack of money, nor could she work due to caring for the baby girl.\r\n\r\nAt present, Yuri is studying, thanks to God and her own efforts plus her husband's help. For three people to live on a single salary is complicated, but they know that it is a great investment for life, taking into account the need for a better remuneration and a higher family income. There are often times when they can't meet their monthly bills. For this reason, Yuri was interested in a loan agreement with Kiva, which gives them hope and the confidence that all will be better.\r\n\r\nYuri's family is very united and loving and for that reason, they make the effort and value the opportunity of studying, enjoying each passing day with their daughter and attempting to teach her that she too should struggle for her dreams without overlooking others.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1513712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay fees for a semester in school.

She is married to Eduardo and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnalyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nAnalyn hopes to become a wholesaler and dreams to have a happy family.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 20,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nJoanna dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes to have a better future.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They met through family, neighborhood and friendship connections. \r\n\r\nThey sell grains, condiments, peanuts, clothing, and prepared food. The women of the DJAMADJIGUI group are seeking their first solidarity loan. \r\n\r\nMariam, the first person seated on the right, is the group member who sells peanuts. She plans on buying 4 bags of unshelled peanuts from producers. The peanuts will be shelled and sold at the market and at home to male and female customers. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn an average monthly income of 20,000 CFA Francs. Part of this income will be reinvested in the business, and part will go towards reimbursing the tontines [savings group].

She is originally from a district in the northern part of the country.  Martha is known for being responsible, hardworking, and having the desire to succeed on a personal level.  In her free time, she enjoys spending time with her children.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, Martha was not able to pursue a degree.  She would have liked to have studied social work.  At the moment, she strives so that her children can study and become successful professionals.  <br \/><br \/>Thanks to her efforts and her drive to move ahead, Martha earns her living by managing a small diner in her home.  She offers home-cooked dishes, juices, sodas, and beer.  Martha works at her business approximately 12 hours a day by offering her products.  The purpose of this loan is to invest it as operating capital and to restock her business.  She will purchase food products for preparing her dishes, juices, sodas, plates, glasses, and cutlery.  In the not-so-distant future, she would like to earn more income.  <br \/><br \/>Martha appreciates the assistance of the Kiva lenders who avail themselves to people who have limited resources and come from poor countries, such as Nicaragua, so that they can have a way of earn a decent

The main source of income comes from agriculture and farming activities that Karen is involved in.  He keeps two cows and owns a big orchard.  He grows different types of fruit including peaches, apricots, cherries and apples as well as nuts and sells it at nearby markets.  Karen does his best to sustain his family's living. \r\n\r\nKaren has now applied to SEF for a loan of $2,700 to purchase a cow and forage to feed the livestock.  Previously, Karen took a loan from a local financial institution but; unfortunately, he was not able to repay it.  However, thanks to recent hard work, he was able to run the agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments.  So, Karen has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":1494269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for a cow and forage for feeding the livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Agarak","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T01:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T01:10:22Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":102.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":103.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":106.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":104.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":106.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":107.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":109.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":108.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":111.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":111.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":111.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":114.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":114.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":116.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":116.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":117.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":119.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":120.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":121.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":123.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.98},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":630,"local_amount":630,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T09:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":630,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459215059},{"amount":1916,"local_amount":1916,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1916,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468040066},{"amount":154,"local_amount":154,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479257413}],"funded_date":"2014-02-18T22:47:13Z","paid_date":"2014-05-17T20:17:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":659164,"name":"Anabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anabel is a married woman from the community of Cortes, Bohol.

His educational background is a bachelors degree. \r\n\r\nDue to a lack of careers in companies, he drives a taxi where he earns a low daily income, which is not enough to provide for his family`s expenses. He is always looking to develop the skills of his children in their studies.

She says that 24 loan cycles ago, she entered the communal bank with Pro Mujer after receiving an invitation from a loan officer who visited her home. Hortencia currently makes a living sewing garments. She began this business on her own when she separated from her husband, because she needed a way to earn money and she knew how to sew so she opened a seamstress shop.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is taking out now will be used to increase her capital by purchasing fabrics, which she will acquire from the wholesale vendors in the city of La Paz. She will then sell the fabrics from her shop. Now that she is divorced, this work permits Hortencia to generate sufficient income to maintain her home and support her son on her own. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the training that the institution offers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3750,"image":{"id":1494479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":3750,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gina Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia Josefa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Toribia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lily Encarnaci\u00f3n\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascuala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa Edith\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Betty\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25864,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2937.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3016.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3099.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3183.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3358.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3450.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3549.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":461.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":474.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":486.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":514.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425.84,"local_amount":2937.08,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2942.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736407},{"amount":437.34,"local_amount":3016.32,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3021.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449641935},{"amount":449.35,"local_amount":3099.2,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3105.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108869},{"amount":461.53,"local_amount":3183.2,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3189.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923920},{"amount":474.07,"local_amount":3269.72,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3275.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144766},{"amount":486.95,"local_amount":3358.48,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3364.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838498},{"amount":1014.92,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7013.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264548}],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T21:54:53Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T13:15:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":659182,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcelina helps her husband manage their farm to make a living.

He is married and the father of 4 children. His shop is located along the road in San.\r\n\r\nIbrahim specializes in the sale of mobile telephones, both in wholesale and retail. He has been in this business for more than 6 years. He is much sought after in the open air markets of the city of San and its surroundings. \r\n\r\nIn order to diversify his business, Ibrahim decided to partner with the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso. He is on his sixth individual loan. He plans to purchase a large stock of mobile telephones of all brands and accessories.\r\n\r\nIbrahim stocks up from wholesalers in Bamako. He sells his products in San and in the open air markets to a customer base made up of men and women, for cash and for credit.

He was not able to go further because there were many obstacles and he needed to help his father at work. He lives with his partner, who has the same level of education. She is a housewife, and together they have three children. The youngest is 8 and is in third form at the local school. The middle child, a girl, is 13 and is in eighth form. She has to attend school in the main town of the region, since there is no eighth form in the village where they live. The oldest is 15; he does not go to school anymore because he was bullied and instead decided to help his father at work in order to improve the family's income. Andr\u00e9s has been a fisherman since he was 10 years old and learned the trade from his father, who was able to support Andr\u00e9 and his brother thanks to the proceeds from his fishing, a tradition Andr\u00e9s now continues. Andr\u00e9s is also a farmer: he grows 3,500 square metres of sweetcorn, which enable him to feed his family. They live very close to the sea, since their house is practically on the beach. This is convenient because it means he does not have to travel very far to go to work. He goes to sea with his son either during the day or at night, depending on the tide. He will use the loan to buy a more powerful boat and engine from a friend. Andr\u00e9s already has some money of his own, which he saved towards this purchase. His goal is to expand his business, since he wants to bring in more fish. He would be able to lend the boat to someone else and, thanks to this small fleet, increase his income in order to give his family a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1513829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been working as a shopkeeper since 2000.  Until 2012 she sold mensware, but for the last year she has been selling children's toys, starting with a sum of 50,000 som (KGS).  Gulnara has been able to increase her business to a monthly income of about 15,000 som.  With the goal of expanding her assortment of goods, especially with the upcoming New Year's holiday, Gulnara has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy new types of toys for her retail business.  She is sure that by expanding her assortment of goods, she will have a chance to increase her income.  Gulnara plans to use part of this income to make repairs to her home, and the other part she plans to further increase her assortments of

Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nMary is a widow with three children. She is a farmer.  She has been farming for fifty years and she is currently growing maize, beans, soya beans, ground nuts and sunflowers on her farm. She is excited about beekeeping as it will give her an opportunity to earn extra income and also provide her with honey for food.\r\n\r\nThis is Mary\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and she intends to use the proceeds from her beekeeping to pay school fees for her grandchildren, who are orphans, and to provide their basic needs.

This is her first loan cycle. Irma sells used clothing six days each week from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in a nearby market. She plans to use this loan to purchase more clothing to resell and she will take advantage of the year-end holidays when there is increased business and therefore more income. The income generated by her business supports her two children so that they can stay in school. Her daughter is in college and studies law and her son is in high school. Irma fully understands that education is a vital key to a successful future, an understanding shared among the almost 19,000 women in Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe women in the Trust Bank \u201cEl Roble\u201d group are engaged in commercial ventures and sell various items like clothing, perfumes and beauty items, cleaning products, and vegetables and fruit. They work hard each day to earn income in order to provide a better future for their families. Friendship Bridge not only provides loans to clients but also gives monthly training. Some of the topics covered during the training include business management, financial planning, and over-indebtedness. Other topics include health, nutrition, and self-esteem. As many of the ladies have had no education at all, this is a great opportunity for them to learn and improve their lives.\r\n\r\nAll of the ladies in the Trust Bank \u201cEl Roble\u201d group welcome the opportunity to secure loans and education. They are most appreciative to Kiva investors and want to send greetings during this holiday time to all!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5650,"image":{"id":1494551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quetzaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.833333 -91.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T14:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T14:00:01Z","loan_amount":5650,"lender_count":177,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepcion Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ericka Jeannette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanira Antonieta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoselin Ivanova ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Irma Jeanette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":44400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5552.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5552.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5552.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5552.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5552.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5552.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5552.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5531.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":706.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":706.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":706.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":706.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":706.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":706.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":706.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":703.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":706.58,"local_amount":5552.6,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449634457},{"amount":706.58,"local_amount":5552.6,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459100952},{"amount":706.58,"local_amount":5552.6,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467915947},{"amount":706.58,"local_amount":5552.6,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479136755},{"amount":706.58,"local_amount":5552.6,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490830645},{"amount":706.59,"local_amount":5552.6,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256588},{"amount":706.58,"local_amount":5552.6,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540112},{"amount":703.93,"local_amount":5531.8,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5546.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530023358}],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T23:04:27Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:59:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":648242,"name":"Geraldine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geraldine is 28 years old and has one children in school.\r\n\r\nShe is in the agricultural business pig fattening in the Philippines.

Five years ago, her husband gave her seed money to start a money-making business selling merchandise on credit to friends. The idea turned out to be successful because she shortly gained customers among her friends and relatives. Today her clientele has grown through referrals.  She sells jeans, shirts, pants, sweaters, perfumes, and women's accessories directly to customers on credit and for cash. She works from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. daily and buys from wholesalers. Her goal is to have a shop open to the public and win the loyalty of her customers so that she can increase sales and profit. She dreams of paying for her children's education so that they can have a bright future.\r\n\r\nBebsy needs to meet year-end demand so that she can sell more and increase her profit, but she doesn't have enough working capital to meet market demand. So she has applied to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for her first Kiva loan, which she will use to buy jeans, shirts, blouses, shoes, colognes, perfumes, and more. She will be able to service her customers and to feel satisfaction in accomplishing her goal.

To tackle financial hardships, she became involved in agriculture 5 years ago. In particular, the farm that Elina runs consists of 3 pigs and some arable land where she cultivates greens and different fruit trees. Elina's husband helps her with farming activities, and they work hard to manage it in a sustainable way and earn good income for their family. Elina is a mother of 2 little kids and perfectly manages to take care of the household and at the same time run a farm. Now this hardworking and enthusiastic woman asks for a loan of USD 1,000 to purchase a pig, chickens, and also some forage for feeding the livestock. A few years ago, Elina has already taken a loan from a local financial institution but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, she was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, Elina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. This loan will greatly help Elina and her husband to continue their farming business and make it profitable."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1494593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He feels that his expertise will be received well in such health-conscious communities.\r\n\r\n\u201cI try to offer my clients healthy alternatives that they can enjoy, but I don\u2019t sacrifice on taste!\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to cooking for his customers, Christopher has also been offering cooking classes throughout the area. \u201cCooking is therapeutic for me, and I want to share this experience with everyone,\u201d he explained. \r\n\r\nChristopher has also gained a degree of celebrity worldwide through making \u201cchewing gum sculptures\u201d. Using only his mouth, he can create miniature sculptures of all shapes on demand. Creations as intricate as a man riding on a horse are not a problem for him to make. Having appeared on shows such as David Letterman, Jay Leno and America\u2019s Got Talent, Christopher\u2019s unusual talent is a testament to his level of creativity.\r\n\r\nChristopher plans to use his $5,000 Kiva loan to pay for the necessary permitting and licensing to open his own kitchen in San Diego.\r\n\r\nIf successful in his cooking venture, he hopes to someday start an above ground shrimp farm where he can provide customers locally grown shellfish."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4269.35,"image":{"id":1514293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Homa Bay county is located at the south-western tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people, and a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay county often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay county means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average. \r\n\r\nPamela is a widow with six children. She is a farmer and has been farming for 15 years now. She is currently growing maize, papaya, bananas, cassava, and beans on her farm. She is interested in beekeeping because it does not require extensive management, especially because bees look for their own food.\r\n\r\nThis is Pamela\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. She likes working with Honey Care because of the management services they provide for the beehives. She intends to use the income generated from her beehives to pay her children\u2019s school fees and invest more in her farming. Pamela\u2019s hope for the future is to expand her beehive project and to help her friends to also take up the project."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.

Four of her children are married and living independently.  Her youngest daughter lives at home with her parents and helps around the farm.  Burulsun has a high school education, and she is engaged in raising livestock as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business 36 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, Burulson now has three cows, 15 sheep, 15 goats and one horse on her farm.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Burulsun has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy sheep so she can increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use the income from this loan to further increase her head of livestock on her farm and to save money for her youngest daughter's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1494285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jan Bulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T14:40:29Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T14:40:29Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burulsun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":255.12,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":12625.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.13,"payment_id":467831077},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":12625.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178392},{"amount":253.37,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12625.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.88,"payment_id":542440359},{"amount":231.88,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":12625.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.37,"payment_id":595435935}],"funded_date":"2014-01-21T22:29:03Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":648256,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of three children, Josephine works hard to support her family.

At first she made clothes for relatives, and when she was ready, she offered dressmaking to order. Today Miriam has her own workshop in her house, where she makes women's, men's, and infant's clothes. She has gained many loyal clients, who ask for tailoring service as well as complete service that includes the materials to make made-to-measure garments. She buys from specialty stores on credit and sells for cash or credit.

Together with her husband, she fights every day for a better future for her family.  She was only able to study through her second year of primary school because she wanted to help her parents so that her siblings were never in need of anything; to do this, she had to abandon her studies.  When she was a young girl, there was also limited access to education.  \r\n\r\nNarcisa is married, and her husband earns a living making cheese in a small family business.  Her children have built her and her husband a home, and the two of them live there together.  \r\n\r\nShe makes a living selling basic grain crops, including corn, gama grass, beans, and other items.  She has been doing this for seven years, and she learned this trade from her husband.  She also takes care of the home chores and helps her husband to make cheese.  Narcisa runs her business out of her house, and she works every day.  When there is a lot of buying activity, she also sells in the town square.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy the recently-harvested grains that are currently most plentiful in the market; this will allow her to buy the grains at a very low cost, to store them, and to then sell them when the price rises, thereby increasing her net profit.  She currently does not have her own capital to invest.  She needs financing in order to take advantage of this business opportunity.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to fix up her house, since it is in poor condition right now.  She hopes to save some of the income she makes over time so that, once she has saved up enough, she can improve her home.
