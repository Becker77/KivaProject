They are very kind people who still keep up their culture and the traditions of their people.  They live in the El Valle parish, an area that enjoys a natural beauty thanks to its uneven terrain.  It is full of green fields; its architecture is a blend of ancient and modern.  Little by little, El Valle has been growing and therefore is an important parish in the city of Cuenca.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Mar\u00eda.  She is taking out her fourth loan along with her friends and fellow members of the Siempre Amigas credit group.

They spend a portion of their time sharing and chatting about things that interest them.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is 63 years old.  She is separated, but she has eight children from her marriage.  Five of them are married and live independently.  Her two single children work in the family tailoring business.

After looking for employment for several months and not finding any work opportunities, she decided to start up her own business, selling fried food such as empanadas, pastries, panzerottis [deep fried savoury tarts] and other products. She learnt the trade from her mother-in-law and since she started her business she has had very good results, as she has the advantage of being located near to a local educational establishment. \r\n\r\nHowever, a while ago she had to face the difficult situation of losing her father, who passed away, which led her to neglect the business somewhat and so the sales declined. But now, motivated by the need to continue supporting her family, she has started the work again and wants to strengthen her business.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is asking for the loan to buy supplies wholesale (vegetables, cornflour, chicken, fizzy drinks) and a large umbrella. This will help her to improve the business's image and she will also be able to produce more food to sell to her customers and satisfy their tastes. Thus she will be able to improve her income so she can continue to look after her family's wellbeing. \r\n\r\nFollowing her father's example, Natalia just wants to carry on providing for the family and so she works hard to achieve this. In the near future she hopes to expand her business to make it more profitable and so improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1513915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies wholesale (vegetables, cornflour, chicken, fizzy drinks) and a large umbrella.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-20T15:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T15:30:07Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natalia Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71396},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":73372},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75403},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77490},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79635},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81839},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":86433},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91284},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":93811},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":96407}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76,"local_amount":144768,"processed_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":149383.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459524080},{"amount":40.27,"local_amount":76701,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":79146.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227708},{"amount":44.16,"local_amount":84110,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":86791.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245338},{"amount":78.94,"local_amount":150354,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":155147.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983157},{"amount":42.63,"local_amount":81205,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":83793.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542541389},{"amount":43.68,"local_amount":83201,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":85853.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561674390},{"amount":40.41,"local_amount":85632,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88361.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.55,"payment_id":579598149},{"amount":137.57,"local_amount":294029,"processed_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":303402.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.79,"payment_id":595188203}],"funded_date":"2014-01-20T17:59:04Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:34:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":659300,"name":"Dilshad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dilshad is a 26-year-old married man.

A year ago, this group received a new one year loan from Friendship Bridge financed by KIVA investors. Happily, they have successfully paid back their loan completely and are now requesting for a new one.\r\n\r\nThere are four new members who have recently joined the group for this loan cycle. Benita is one of them. She is 41 years of age and has six children, who range in age from eight to fourteen years old. Benita is a widow and works hard to meet the basic needs of her children. She understands the importance of nutritious food and healthy habits. Like 88% of the women in her Trust Bank, she never attended school but she is keenly aware of the importance of education. Benita understands that she is investing in the successful future of each of her children, knowing that their lives will be different because of the opportunities that she is working hard to give them. All six of her children are in primary school and she has high hopes that they will continue further.\r\n\r\nBenita is a hard-working business woman. She sells vegetables in her community market and raises chickens to sell as well. But, Benita has a clear vision of growing her business and having additional income. For this reason, she is currently requesting her first loan with Friendship Bridge. Benita will use the funds to start a new agricultural business. She will buy flower seeds as well as seeds to grow peas. She will also purchase fertilizer. Finally, Benita plans to buy more chickens to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nShe shares with much astonishment, \"It is amazing to know that many people around the world want to know my story and the story of the Trust Bank so they can support us through microloans. I like being part of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cAzul\u201d. We have such a great opportunity to share and know each other a bit more in our monthly meetings. We appreciate the trainings in various topics like effective business practices, indebtedness, nutrition, healthy habits and self-esteem. We understand how important it is to acquire more knowledge about these subjects. Thank you, KIVA investors, for this wonderful

It is full of friendly and hardworking women, men and children. It is one of the smaller towns in the department of Solol\u00e1 in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. The women of Santa Catarina work in various businesses including textile production, weaving and small businesses like mini bookstores and shops for the sale of items for daily consumption.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, a group of women united together and formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCatalinas\u201d meaning \u201cwomen of Santa Catarina. Currently, there are eight women in the group with the goal of creating their own solutions as successful entrepreneurs thereby overcoming poverty.\r\n\r\nLidia is a 27 year old married woman with four children, who range in age from four to twelve years old. Although she only had one year of formal education, Lidia is keenly aware that her children need to have as much education as possible so that they can enjoy a successful future. This is a common desire among the clients of Friendship Bridge. Her oldest child will start the 7th grade next year while the others will continue in elementary school. Lidia is an enterprising woman who decided two years ago to start a bookstore business located in a small room of her own house. She lives right in the center of Santa Catarina Palopo and there is a lot of foot traffic past her business. Lidia is applying for a new loan with Friendship Bridge as she needs more financial capital for her business. She will use the funds to purchase inventory for her bookstore, especially various types and sizes of notebooks, books and other school supplies. Lidia wants to be well-prepared to have the necessary school supplies so that when parents visit her shop at the beginning of the year, her store will be fully stocked.\r\n\r\nAll of the women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCatalinas\u201d send an affectionate greeting to KIVA investors during this holiday season. They hope that the New Year is full of blessings and good health for all."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1494676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy notebooks, books and other school supplies to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Catarina Polopo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T15:40:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T15:40:36Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Lucrecia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3502},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3502},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3502},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3502},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3502},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3490}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":446.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":444.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":446.09,"local_amount":3502,"processed_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3514.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449634459},{"amount":446.09,"local_amount":3502,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3514.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459100954},{"amount":446.08,"local_amount":3502,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3514.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467915949},{"amount":446.09,"local_amount":3502,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3514.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479136757},{"amount":446.09,"local_amount":3502,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3514.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490830647},{"amount":444.56,"local_amount":3490,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3502.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256590}],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T23:07:28Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T12:29:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Devashini Satiananden","image":401253}},{"id":648295,"name":"Annabelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annabelle is a married woman with five children from Talibon, Bohol.

Both of his children attend the local school while he runs a poultry farm. When he was younger, Sanatan worked in a machine shop in Bangalore, a large city in the adjacent state. The work was dangerous and he lost his left hand. After this, it was very difficult to find work, so he returned home. \r\n\r\nThree years ago, he started running his poultry farm, which he can do despite his disability. It has helped bring a steady income for his family. From this activity he earns 8,000 INR per month.

adults now. They are still all living together in an Ashkali community of Kosovo. \r\n\r\nUnemployment is high in these communities and she is fortunate that her husband is a taxi driver in his area, but he still doesn't earn enough to take care of all of the family expenses they have monthly. As a way to remedy this problem and ease some of their difficulties, Miradija and her husband have decided to start a new business. Working together as partners, they will sell used technical equipment that they will purchase in some of the bigger western European countries such as Germany. These products will include, but are not limited to, televisions, freezers, fax machines, scanners and even tires. For this reason she applied for a 2,000 EUR loan in order to buy technical equipment.\r\n\r\nThey will then sell this used equipment in a local market at a higher price to make a profit on each item.  Since they are able to purchase these things at a low price, they believe that this business will be successful and Miradija is very happy that her first job and work experience will be as a business partner with her husband, which leads her to feel confident and secure about their decision.

They estimate this will bring in several thousand more rupees a month for the family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1494326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for sewing machines for her tailoring business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhenkanal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T16:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T16:00:08Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T18:39:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":648019,"name":"Khyanaprabha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For 10 years, Khyanaprabha worked alongside her husband running a medium-sized restaurant, or as the locals say, a \u201chotel business\u201d in their town in Odisha, a state in Eastern India.

Through hard work and the help of her daughters, she has saved 70,000 INR for this project and is taking out this loan for 30,000 INR.

More than 26 years ago, he trained in automotive bodywork and painting and began to get experience working at a business for 10 years. There he added to his knowledge and perfected his techniques. However, after the death of the owner of the business, it closed and many people were left unemployed. Because of this, 16 years ago, he started his own independent business, taking advantage of the contacts he had from the services he had provided. He works in an open air space which makes his job difficult during the rainy season. Nonetheless, he continues to go forward. He works every day from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and that is how he is able to generate resources to support his family. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for is to buy a compressor and work tools. He will also pay off a debt that he has. This will allow him to continue with his work and optimize his work time, being able to deliver the vehicles to his customers in a timely manner. This opens the door for him earn the loyalty of the customers he has now and to become better known through word of mouth. This will increase the income that he gets from his work. \r\n\r\nDaniel says that his project for the near future is to acquire a house that has a large garage where he can work comfortably during the rainy season. This will allow him to generate more profits and he will be able to give his family a better well being.

He learned his trade from his family, and thanks to his background and experience he has a good, fixed clientele.  His workshop is located in his home but he also pays house calls when his customers need it so he doesn't have a fixed work schedule.  To strengthen his business, he requests a loan to buy a larger compressor and some parts and supplies in bulk.  This will allow him to optimize his time and improve the quality of his work, since he will have everything he needs available to meet his customers' needs.

I was always very impressed with their level of knowledge, and the things they taught us were very interesting. One of my teachers was Mr. Lustig, who also teaches at AUCA. He taught economics at our school, and I after I completed the course I decided that economics should be my profession.\r\n\r\nI hope that I will be a good international economist, and that I will be able to make a contribution to the field of study.

The loan will be used to buy more furniture for making more beds and chairs for sale, and will help Micheal to generate greater profits and bridge the financial gap in his business and also pay school fees for his children. \n\nMicheal hopes that in the future he will be able to provide better quality in his business. \n\nMicheal is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

This is his story: \r\n\r\n\"I decided to apply to the International and Business Law Program because I always felt that I want to help other people learn their rights, and because it is a respected profession in our country. I think it is vital to know our rights because it can assist in the fight against injustice and lawlessness. Unfortunately, Kyrgyzstan is very corrupt and lacks order. It does have laws, but they work ineffectively and a lot of officials in government change and use the law for their own personal purposes. All of these problems have slowly led Kyrgyzstan into total chaos. I am concerned with such troubles, and thus I want to try to change it for the better. It may sound ridiculous, but I really want to influence politics. To achieve my goal I need to become a lawyer to understand the basics of law creation. \r\n\r\nI want Kyrgyzstan to prosper and I want to try to stop or at least decrease the level of corruption and lawlessness. If we will not struggle for law and rights, we will end up like Afghanistan or Somalia because the chaos will lead to the destruction of education, economics, government, and finally the country. Kyrgyzstan suffered from two revolutions, and the reason for both of them was that no one, including the leaders, obeyed the law. \r\n\r\nThat's why I want to study at the International and Business Law Program: to protect my own rights and to help other people to protect theirs. The knowledge of law is one of the keys of survival in our tough world. I also hope that I can use this knowledge to help Kyrgyzstan.

She lives in the south of Tajikistan and she is married with five children.  She started her business raising livestock six years ago, as she was in need of money.  Her husband does not make a sufficient salary, so Dilbar began to increase her business little by little.  She bought livestock, fattened them up for a few months and sold them o at the local market for a higher price.  She has a big garden where she grows hay for the animals.  She also sells milk to her neighbors, who are very satisfied with the natural dairy products they receive.  Dilbar needs to put on her daughter's wedding, but she does not have enough money.  She is asking for a loan of 6,000 somoni to buy the necessary wedding items for her daughter.

All children are too young to attend school.  Altynay has a secondary education. To provide income for her family, Altynay has worked in farming and raising livestock.  She started six years ago, with the purchase of cattle for 25,000 KGS. Altynay and her husband have been living in a shed for six years. Through her hard work, Altynay's household now has 3 dairy cows, 2 heifers, 1 horse, and 2 bulls.  At the same time, she has cultivated 2.8 hectares of land, where she grows beans and perennial grasses. Altynay milks the cows and sells the milk for cash. Altynay's husband works as a shepherd, herding livestock for other local residents for a fee. Their monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further grow her business, Altynay has turned to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in order to buy a cow for breeding. Altynay plans to invest the loan income into further increasing the amount of domestic animals, and plans to save enough money to pay for the higher education of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1495137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sheker village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T18:40:10Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.63,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Altynay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":210,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10322.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749672},{"amount":284.37,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":15484.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.63,"payment_id":595435937}],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T04:08:53Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":648405,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa is 35 years old; she is married, and is now applying for a loan of $600 to improve her business.

All of her children are in school.  Zarima has a secondary education. She travels through life optimistically, knows exactly what she wants and achieves it all through her own efforts. Zarima knows how to properly use and plan funds to achieve her goals. Zarima is the main income source for her family.  She has engaged in livestock raising and farming, starting 15 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS. Through her hard work, Zarima's household now has 7 dairy cows, 3 heifers, 5 steers, and a small plot where she grows beans and perennial grasses. She has all the necessary conditions to raise cattle: a barn for keeping cattle, and distant pastures. She procures all the necessary hay and fodder. Her spouse works in transporting passengers. Their monthly gross income is 11,000 som (KGS). In order to further grow her business, Zarima has appealed to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy a cow for cattle breeding. Zarima plans to invest the loan income into increasing the amount of domestic animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1495172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

After all, the creation of a family is a holy and responsible step. Bobur does not want to become a burden to his parents. Thus, Bobur works hard day and night. He unloads goods at a train station, which is located in the Spitamen region.  Babur has his own team of workers.  They all work very amicably.\r\nAt the same time, Bobur is also engaged in raising livestock. He raises sheep and goats at home. Bobur has recently started his business, but seeing that this occupation is profitable, he has decided to increase the number of livestock, especially because he has a place where he can raise cattle without difficulty. After learning about MDO \"Arvand\", Bobur has turned to the organization for funds. Bobur plans to use this loan to purchase cattle. He hopes for the support of the organization, and expresses his gratitude in advance!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1491095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T19:00:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bobur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":69.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":71.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":76.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":81.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":84.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":90.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":96.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":97.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.55,"local_amount":69.1,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":74.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673610},{"amount":16.07,"local_amount":71.44,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":76.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144402},{"amount":16.62,"local_amount":73.86,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":79.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960217},{"amount":17.18,"local_amount":76.37,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":82.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180977},{"amount":17.77,"local_amount":78.96,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875573},{"amount":18.37,"local_amount":81.63,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302799},{"amount":18.99,"local_amount":84.4,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":90.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585600},{"amount":19.63,"local_amount":87.26,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":93.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081179},{"amount":84.82,"local_amount":376.98,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":404.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562058}],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T02:17:24Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":648413,"name":"Sajida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sajida is a 40-year-old married woman and the mother of three sons.

In fact, her husband also does the same work at home, but earns an insufficient income. So, she helps her husband with his tasks related to embroidery.  She sells embroidery dresses in her town. By this time, she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income. She has become an expert in embroidery, through a machine, and wants more raw materials for embroidery so that she can easily cope with the increasing demand for her arts. \r\n\r\nShe is a mother of five children.  She hopes to get a boost in her earnings through her large sales. She wishes to utilize a portion of the revenue to provide a quality education for her children.\r\n\r\nNagina thanks Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

He started off by selling popcorn as a street vendor, a job where he could save some money during the years he did it. Four years ago he changed his job to do washing-machine rental. This work has generated enough income to meet his household costs and to support his wife and their two children. He works every day from 8am to 6pm, creating two direct jobs.<br \/><br \/>Eliecer is now asking for a loan in order to buy various spare parts that he needs to repair two damaged washing machines. With the loan he will be able to improve the installed capacity and satisfy demand for his services, thus improving his family's income.<br \/><br \/>Eliecer states that his great dream is to leave a good legacy to his children so that they are not in need. In order to do this he wants to provide his business with good credit and extend his services to other neighbouring districts, which would allow him to improve the profitability of his business and to guarantee a favourable economic stability to provide his children with better life opportunities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1514134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy various spare parts that he needs to repair two damaged washing machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-01-20T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliecer De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35698},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":36686},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37702},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":38745},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39818},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40920},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":42052},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43216},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44413},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45642},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":46905},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":48203}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.43},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.81,"local_amount":72384,"processed_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78157.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459524103},{"amount":53.83,"local_amount":97873,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":105679.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227732},{"amount":33.16,"local_amount":60286,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":65094.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245357},{"amount":39.72,"local_amount":72212,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":77971.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856099},{"amount":35.07,"local_amount":63764,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":68849.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282809},{"amount":36.14,"local_amount":65714,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":70955.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983175},{"amount":37.27,"local_amount":67767,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":73172.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531789885}],"funded_date":"2014-01-21T20:36:46Z","paid_date":"2014-09-25T09:27:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon Rees","image":null}},{"id":659394,"name":"Jamila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamila is a 40-year-old married woman.

For that purpose, Laert has applied for this loan to purchase 8 piglets and forage for feeding the livestock.

Nodar is unemployed at the moment and is seeking a job, but according to the fact that there is a high unemployment rate in the region, it became hard for Nodar to get a suitable job.\r\n \r\nIn order to generate income and cover the household expenses, Nodar is requesting a loan. If his loan is raised on the Kiva website, Nodar will buy a mini-bus and start working on a line. He will transport passengers from his district to a neighboring town and get a service fee.

She does not take care of additional family members.  She has a retail shop business and has been in this business for one year.  She has applied for a loan of 300,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more sugar, rice and soap.  She generates additional income from working as a promotions manager. She works in a shop and sells on a retail basis seven days out of every week.  Her major business challenges include thieves and ever increasing prices of commodities.

He is the father of four children who he has raised with the earnings from his agricultural work.  He learned this trade from a young age, having worked side by side with his father who instilled this family tradition in him.  Today, it is his main source of income.  He has plantain crops and he also raises and sells pigs.  The crops and animals are both sold in his town's market.  In addition to this, he also works as a day laborer on different farms in the region, which supplements his income, allowing him to cover the basic expenses of his household, and provide his children with an education.  \r\n\r\nThe loan he is seeking will be used to purchase agricultural supplies in bulk (manure, pesticides, larvicides and animal feed).  This will allow him to continue his work and increase his profit margin from selling his products.

The loan will improve his car\u2019s function and he will be able to go out to work with more confidence.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dreams are to be able to have more and bigger busses in good repair so he can do his work, be able to go out on trips with others, and make trips to places farther away since he can\u2019t take long trips with his current bus because of its age.  But he will be able to save up little by little so he can buy one in better shape and be able to have more income for his
