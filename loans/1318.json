She is a farmer and a homemaker. Besides her farm work, she also has a small corner grocery store with which she is able to help her partner cover the household expenses. For example, she covers the costs of electricity and water, while he covers food expenses. She learned to work the land through her father, as her family has long been farmers. This was her only source of income as she grew and expanded her business. Her customers are various middlemen, neighbors, acquaintances, and friends from the area, as well as various other profit [sources] at times.\r\n\r\nToday, she is requesting financing from the COMIXMUL cooperative, which she will invest in the purchase of farming supplies such as fertilizers, manure, cleaners and labor costs, since this is how she will strengthen and develop her coffee beans to make them healthy and the right size for sale. Her family's quality of life depends on the income from this, so she hopes that the purchase price of the coffee will enable her to continue investing in expanding her crops.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the

He has been driving a rickshaw for many years to meet the family expenses, but now it requires proper maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, Rukhul has applied for a loan, for her husband.

","en":"Khurshed was born in 1992, in one of the settlements in the city of Isfara. Since childhood he dreamed of being responsible for large fields, like his grandfather. Every day, after school, he went to his grandfather and helped him until late in the summer evening. When he grew up, after finishing secondary school, he started at the agricultural university. He got married and lives with his parents. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Khurshed studies by distance, and in parallel he works with his childhood activities and dream. In the autumn he gathered all his harvest and sold it. For the money earned, he rented new land and would like to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizers. However, he does not currently have enough money. Therefore he turned to Arvand for material support. For the money he receives, he expands his business and this way improves life for himself and his family. He is very thankful to the employees of Arvand for the financial support.

He is married and has three children who depend on him. Since his young years, Ochilboy worked with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding. He helped his father raise cattle. Later, when he got married, he started working as a taxi driver, but this type of business did not bring in a lot of income. He decided to continue his father's trade. \r\n\r\nWith help from his large family, he sows potatoes and receives an income for everyday family expenses. However, this is not a lot for such a large family. For their future, Ochilboy needs to save money and have a stable source of income through livestock breeding. Therefore, he currently wants to purchase several heads of cattle and raise them and expand his business. Through working this way, he would like to earn money for his family and raise his children worthily and support them with all necessary means. To do this, Ochilboy turned to Arvand and would like to receive a loan to purchase livestock. He hopes for extra income and thanks Arvand in advance.

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nJohn is married and has thirteen children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for thirteen years now and they are currently growing maize, cassava, sunflower and watermelon on their farm. His wife runs a small business. John is excited about beekeeping as it is easy to manage, it requires little land space and it is a good source of income.\r\n\r\nThis is John\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He is interested in working with Honey Care as it gives him an opportunity to acquire beehives for a loan. He plans to use the income generated from beekeeping to pay school fees for his children and to invest more in beekeeping.

He works with nearly 1,000 farmers in Rwanda's Southern Province, providing them cash advances so that they can grow the rice, which he buys back from them, processes, and sells to schools, hospitals, restaurants, and hotels all over Rwanda. \n\nCurrently, the farmers that Jean Bosco works with grow short-grain rice, the cheapest variety used primarily for animal feed, as well as for low-cost bulk purchases in rural schools.\n\nJean Bosco, a 35-year-old father and business man, is looking for a Kiva loan so that he can process a new kind of rice, the long-grain variety primarily used in restaurants and hotels in Kigali. This higher priced product would bring more money to the farmers, and it would allow Jean Bosco to expand his business and hire additional employees in processing and distribution.\n\nCurrently Jean Bosco's rice processing business has the capacity to process twice as much rice. With this working capital loan, Jean Bosco can work with more farmers during the January harvest period, increase the rice processing at his facility, and hire more technicians and distributors. \n\nJean Bosco hopes that over the next year, his factory will become the largest rice processor in Southern Rwanda, employing almost 100 permanent staff, and working with more than 2,000 farmers throughout the region. This loan will be enable him to get one step closer to that goal.

Homa Bay county is located at the south-western tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people, and a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay county often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay county means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average. \r\n\r\nFredrick is married and has two children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for 13 years now and they are currently growing maize, millet, beans, tomatoes, kale, sunflower, and watermelon on their farm. Fredrick is interested in beekeeping because it is easy to manage and it gives a different taste to farming.\r\n\r\nThis is Fredrick\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He is interested in working with Honey Care because of the opportunity it offers in providing beehives on loan, which is very encouraging. He plans to use the income generated from beekeeping to pay for school fees for his children and to provide for basic needs. Fredrick\u2019s hope for the future is to invest in more hives for beekeeping."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Sindo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-21T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-19T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":17100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":17100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T00:51:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":659480,"name":"Maria Dominga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Dominga tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposo e hijos en el caser\u00edo las Juntas una zona rural del distrito de Querocotillo, una comunidad que se caracteriza por sus paisajes verdes, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda, ubicado a dos horas de la ciudad de Cutervo que pertenece a la Regi\u00f3n Cajamarca, sierra norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nJunto a su esposo se dedican a vender ganado vacuno, lo compran en los caser\u00edos aleda\u00f1os, para posteriormente engordarlo y ofrecerlo a sus clientes en la plaza de ganado de su distrito, Ella ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 2 000 nuevos soles para la compra de toretes para ofrecerlo a un mejor precio, generando mayores ingresos para su familia.\n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda Dominga is 43 years old and lives with her husband and children in Las Juntas village, a rural area in the Querocotillo district.

Despite its proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practised in the region, many individuals have expressed an interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nBenard is married and has three children. He and his wife are farmers. His wife is a housewife. They have been farming for five years and are currently growing bananas, papaya, vegetables, maize and blue gum trees on their farm. Benard is looking forward to beekeeping, as he loves honey, and this is an opportunity for him to generate extra income.\r\n\r\nThis is Benard\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He is interested in working with Honey Care because the organization is offering him a loan that he can afford and because of its good relations with farmers. He plans to use the income generated from beekeeping to pay school fees for his children and to support the vulnerable in the community. His hope for the future is to generate enough income to educate his children and improve his family\u2019s lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

","en":"Nasiba is a resident of the city of Istaravshan.  She is 37 years old and the mother of two children, a son and a daughter who both go to school.  Nasiba's husband is a driver who works along a city line from early morning until the evening.  Nasiba also works to make a living.  She is a skilled craftswoman who has been involved in sewing for the past six years.  She takes orders at home and mostly sews different styles of women's traditional dresses.

Sayora herself has been involved in sewing for the past three years.  She sews curtains and drapes of different designs and takes her business very seriously.  Each one of her orders is custom-fit and she is happy with the results of her work.  Sayora's only daughter helps her to run the business.  She now wants to expand her activity and to do so, she is taking a loan.  She would like to buy an additional sewing machine in order to increase the quantity of curtains and drapes that she produces.

Using those materials, she and her husband will repair and insulate their house, thus creating a comfortable and warm place for themselves and their children. Also, the renovated house will reduce coal consumption greatly, contributing to the efforts against air pollution."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3805.73,"image":{"id":1514912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Her application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1000 GEL for purchasing a milk cow.  After the cow is purchased the family will start producing dairy products like cheese and yogurt for sale. They will also use the milk products for family consumption.

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake.  Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area.  Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes.  Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nJohn is married and has six children.  Both he and his wife have been farming for twenty years now.  They are currently growing watermelon, sunflowers and cassava. John is interested in beekeeping because compared to other farming activities, it does not require a lot of land, it takes less time to manage, and it generates more income.\r\n\r\nThis is John\u2019s first loan with Honey Care.  He likes to work with Honey Care because it will help him gain more knowledge in beekeeping.  He intends to use the proceeds from beekeeping to pay for fees and provide for the basic needs of his family.  His hope for the future is to expand his honey project and become the biggest producer of honey in his village."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Sindo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T03:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T03:40:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-24T03:25:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Meiers","image":null}},{"id":648567,"name":"Sumaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sumaya is a married woman who was born in 1983.

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, and borders onto Lake Victoria, the second-largest lake in the world.  Populations are dense close to the lake, where many individuals make their living from fishing, and a few work in the small but slowly growing tourism industry.  A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe.  Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nConsolata is married and has seven children.  Both she and her husband are farmers.  They have been farming for thirty years now and are currently growing amaranth, maize, sunflowers and beans on their land.  Her husband is very old and is currently not working.  Consolata is excited about beekeeping as it will be an opportunity for her to earn extra income and the honey she will get will be a good source of medicine for coughs and burns.\r\n\r\nThis is Consolata\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and she intends to use the money generated from beekeeping to pay for fees, provide for their basic needs and to support her farming activities.

Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflowers, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes.  Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nGilbert is married and has eight children.

Gilbert's sunflower crops will be especially good for his bee colonies, as bees enjoy feeding on the nectar from the flowers.  Gilbert is excited to start working with Honey Care because he now has access to modern Langstroth beehives instead of the traditional hives usually used in his region. \r\n\r\nThis is Gilbert's first loan with Kiva, and he plans to use the income generated by his beehives to further invest in beehives and beekeeping equipment.

She is glad that her business is assisted and supported by Ruma agents.\r\n \r\nAs her business continues, she hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva to process more mobile phone airtime credits transactions on weekends. For the last three months, she has had around $10-$11 per day sales just from selling mobile phone airtime credits. Ani plans to seek more business opportunities and put aside the extra cash for her children's education. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Ani is standing in front of her stall. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1515008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to process more mobile phone airtime credits on weekends","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bandung Barat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2014-01-21T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-25T09:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1193819.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504389046}],"funded_date":"2014-01-21T07:10:05Z","paid_date":"2014-07-25T09:19:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":659692,"name":"Om-Aseel Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Om-Aseel.

He also works for a local private company as a driver, and his salary generates approximately 250-300 Gel per month.

He is a very hard-working man who takes good care of the colony of bees in his bee-hive and cultivates his land seasonally. He is unmarried and lives in the Kvareli district of the Kakheti region.\r\n\r\nBecause he has gained good experience as a driver, Vazha wishes to start his own taxi business. After several unsuccessful attempts to obtain start-up credit, Vazha applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of the organization's start-up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva serving poor rural entrepreneurs who hope to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nThis loan of $2,500 will allow Vazha to purchase a second-hand car. He will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them to and from nearby cities.

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya, and at over 6,300 feet above sea level, Kitale is one of Africa\u2019s most elevated towns. The rich soil of the area makes it one of the nation's biggest maize producing regions, lending it the nickname of \u201cthe breadbasket of Kenya\u201d. Many farmers in the region have started projects planting bluegum trees on their land, which complement the region\u2019s natural forests and provide bees with a variety of food sources. The people around Kitale have been beekeeping for centuries, and the area is dense with strong bee colonies. Ronald is married, and has six children.

However, due to lack of funds, she is unable to meet the daily demands of her customers. She is currently in her 3rd loan cycle and has previously borrowed Rs 40,000 from Kashf Foundation. Her repayment record is very good. She intends to use this loan amount to buy a new stitching machine as well as some raw material such as cloth, threads of different colors, laces and zips etc, to create a means of increasing revenues, so she may be able to generate a healthier source of income. She also educates young girls in her community about stitching techniques. \r\n

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. It is located close to Uganda and Mount Elgon, an extinct volcano which straddles the two nations and even has a peak at the Kenya-Uganda border. Founded by European settlers in the early 1900s, Kitale originally grew due to its proximity to the Ugandan railway. The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping. Kitale is the headquarters of the Kenya Seed Company, whose massive sunflower plantations provide nearby bees with a veritable buffet of high-quality forage. Jackson is married and has four children. Both him and his wife have been farming for fifteen years now, and are currently growing maize, beans and millet on their land.

When she's not making dresses, she earns some extra money on the side removing weeds on people's farms.\r\n\r\nThe roof on Maisara's house has been damaged for some time, and has yet to repaired; with the onset of winter this year, and remembering how badly the roof was leaking last winter, Maisara would like to repair it, but lacks the money to do so.  As such, she's seeking a loan from Arvand to buy the necessary materials to repair her roof, and hopes they'll be able to help her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1493177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She has been a part of Pro Mujer for a year, joining at the invitation of a promoter of the institution who visited her home. She currently has a fish selling business, which she started at the recommendation of her mother, who taught her how to do this since she was a child. Since she started her own family she decided to start her own business independently.\r\n \r\nThis loan will be used for the purchase of fishnets and fish, which will be bought from wholesale sellers from the neighbourhoods close to her house, and will be sold at her shop. This line of work helps her generate income to sustain her home, since Wilma lives with her partner and has four children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked why she likes Pro Mujer, she answered that she she likes

Fatehia is the group's representative. She is a 28-year-old woman. She exhibits good moral values and is concerned for the well-being of her family, who are now living in a partially-finished house that needs essential construction work to be completed.  She has therefore requested a loan from AMB, which she will use to buy construction materials in order to finish building her house. Fatehia states that she feels happy and grateful to Kiva lenders for the support that she is being provided, because in this way she will be able to provide better living conditions for her family.

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya, and at over 6,300 feet above sea level, it is one of Africa\u2019s most elevated towns. The rich soil of the area makes it one of the nation's biggest maize-producing regions, lending it the nickname of \u201cthe bread basket of Kenya.\u201d Many farmers in the region have started projects planting bluegum trees on their land, which complement the region\u2019s natural forests and provide bees with a variety of food sources. The people around Kitale have been beekeeping for centuries, and the area is dense with strong bee colonies.\r\n\r\nNathaniel is married and has five children. His wife works as a teacher while Nathaniel engages in projects on their land. He has been farming for 20 years and is currently growing maize, sunflower, beans, bananas and oranges as well as tending to livestock. He is excited to start beekeeping because the bees will help pollinate his crops (particularly his sunflowers, oranges and bananas), leading to higher yield and quality. \r\n\r\nThis is Nathaniel\u2019s first loan with Kiva, and he plans to use the income generated by his beehives to invest in new projects on his land.

Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\r\n\r\nIsaack is married and has five children. Both him and his wife have been farming for sixty years and are currently growing maize, trees, beans, a fruit orchard and rearing livestock. He says he likes beekeeping because, \u201cI will not strain to look after them\u201d and is happy to have purchased hives because, \u201cI will enjoy honey in my old age because of them.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is Isaack\u2019s first loan with Kiva, and he plans to use the income from his beehives to cater for his health needs. His hope for the future is \u201cto see my young grandchildren succeed in life.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":38.89,"image":{"id":1487095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T11:40:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":3167,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-27T10:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3350.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611808226}],"funded_date":"2013-12-24T00:25:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Moody","image":null}},{"id":648683,"name":"Marthe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marthe is 33 years old and married with six children.

She knows that the world has more to offer her and that she doesn't want to deny herself parts of the world. She also knows about potential and she knows she can contribute something to the building of a better country. Like many people in this country, when she carries her life's flag forward, she faces obstacles that try to stop her from reaching her goals. Nonetheless, perseverance, optimism, and the always unconditional help from selfless people along the way are part of the necessary conditions for her to get ahead, from the darkest shadow to the budding of a dream. \r\n\r\nXiomara, who is writing this letter, grew up in a neighborhood that was a little harsh and difficult for a girl like her. But this wasn't the end that was awaiting her. That is why she decided to go down the difficult road and not just go with the flow. She set a goal and started to work for herself. She wants to be a doctor and help children in the community where she lives, doing everything possible to ensure that these children have a window of opportunity so that these innocents can have the dreams that define them come true. Right now she is studying nursing. She is in her third semester and she is more motivated than ever. The expectations that she had at first have been achieved satisfactorily. Right now, she is certain of finding the path she wanted. She is decided to go down the road till the end. That is why today she works a half shift as a domestic assistant, receiving half a salary to pay for the ticket to get to where she wants. Nonetheless, this is a time when her resources are limited day to day, since because of different reasons, her salary is being reduced.  \r\n\r\nSince she started to study nursing, and as the days go by, she sees the possibility of being a doctor get closer everyday. Medicine and being able to help people are her passion and now she is doing her training n several hospitals she sees how the dream that she has is starting to take shape. Nonetheless, the dream goes beyond that and she knows that nursing is only a step that will help her grow, becoming a source of income that in the future, with dedication, hard work, and savings, will guarantee her going to the university.\r\n \r\nNursing will guarantee her a stable income, and allow her to support her nephew who came into the world with learning problems. Nursing will also help her to pay for tuition and later specialization to keep ascending in her work, seeking better income.  \r\n\r\nThis letter was written with the purpose of getting help from Kiva to continue with her dream, to break the cycle that many people unfairly have to live in this country because they are poor. This agreement will guarantee help for enterprising people so that they can in turn extend that help to people who need it in the future.  \r\n\r\nThank you.

In addition to selling provisions, she also sells Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, and women's' accessories). She works with her brother, because she has to look after him as well as make a living. She has had this business for over 15 years, which allows her to move forwards.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy more stock for her store.

She has a high school education and her outlook on life is optimistic, as she knows exactly what she wants and she seeks it with all her might.  Kimiya knows how to properly spend and budget her money to achieve her goals.  She has been involved in raising livestock for 15 years, which is the main source of income for her family.  Kimiya started this business with the purchase of livestock for 30,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, her farm now has three dairy cows, one horse and 28 sheep.  \r\n\r\nShe has all the facilities for keeping animals: a barn in which to keep her livestock and pastures for roaming.  Her dairy cows are kept on the farm all year long and she looks after them herself, but her sheep are tended by a shepherd from March to October.  She provides sufficient quantities of hay and feed for the animals.  Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her farming business further, Kimiya has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy cows so she can increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use the income from this loan to further increase her head of livestock, as well as to save up money to improve her financial situation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1495888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
