","en":"Jumagul is a 62-year-old widow who has raised three daughters.  Two of her daughters are migrant workers in Russia who wash dishes in restaurants.  Every month, they send part of their salary to their mother in Kyrgyzstan as financial support.  Jumgaul's youngest daughter lives with her and helps her around the house.  For a long time after her husband's death, Jumgaul found it very difficult to live through the loss of someone so close to her.  She needed to raise and care for her daughters, so she decided to take the responsibility for her household into her own hands.  \r\n\r\nJumgaul has been involved in raising livestock since 1983, a business she started with the purchase of one cow for 1,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work and support, her monthly income is now 5,000 som KGS and her farm now has four dairy cows which she milks twice a day.  She makes tvorog (quark), kefir and sour cream from their milk and sells it to retail customers.  With the goal of increasing her head of livestock, Jumagul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan so she can buy one cow to raise up.  She plans to use the income from this to further increase her head of livestock, as well as to make repairs to her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1495920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The last year has been very difficult for Bajramsha since her husband passed away, leaving her to raise six children on her own and creating a state of depression for her. \r\n\r\nBajramsha used to work together with her husband, selling different pieces of clothing in a market, but after his death she was unable to continue their business, due to family and house responsibilities. Instead, she now receives a social pension and some assistance from a humanitarian organization, but it is not enough money and she continues to be very poor and to live in bad conditions. \r\n\r\nBajramsha has applied for a loan in the amount of EUR 600 (Euros) in order to facade the inside and outside of the house, creating better insulation for the home, by keeping the heat in and the cold out. This will not only improve the overall living conditions of her family and allow them to live comfortably in the winter, but it will also contribute to their overall health and well-being.

Kanpiya is rich in children and a happy mother.  The three eldest children are in college, the next three are in school and the youngest daughter is not yet in school.  Kanpiya is proud of her children and the fact that they are all hard-working children who love and respect each other.  Kanpiya has a high school education and her outlook on life is optimistic.  She knows exactly what she wants and she goes after it with all her strength.  She knows how to properly spend and budget her money to reach her goals.\r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for their family, Kanpiya and her husband raise livestock, a business they started 25 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 3,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, Kanpiya now has two dairy cows, nine sheep, two horses and two goats on her farm.  She has everything she needs to take care of the animals, including a barn and a roaming pasture, and she gives them enough hay and feed.  Every member of the family has their own responsibilities, and everyone tries to contribute to the betterment of their family's living conditions.  Their monthly income is 15,000 com (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of developing her farming business further, Kanpiya has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy one dairy cow to increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use the income from this loan to further increase her head of livestock, as well as to save up money to construct outhouses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1495932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

old. She is a native of the town of Isfara. Musharafkhon is married and with her husband is raising two sons. Their sons are 21 and 19 years old. One of the reasons that Musharafkhon's husband loves her so much is that she cooks so deliciously. Musharafkhon, like many Tajik women, knows how to cook and strives for her dishes to be enjoyed by her husband. In Tajikistan, especially in the districts and villages there are few cafes and dining halls, because the majority of women know how to cook. Musharafkhon is no exception. <br \/><br \/>Using her skills, Musharafkhon decided to start her own business. She wants to make baked goods. But in order to start this business, she needs to buy ovens and products for baking. She decided to take a loan to acquire necessary means. Her new activitiy already means a lot to Musharafkhon and she believes in and hopes for

This has generated income which supports her husband with the household finances.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is seeking will be used to invest in the purchase of supplies and merchandise at wholesale (fabric, thread, paint, ceramic figurines, etc.).  This will allow her to continue to work and offer more variety to her customers.  It will also allow her to fulfill the orders she already has, and will increase her sales and income. Martha states that her future plans are to strengthen and grow her business even more with the aim of generating job opportunities for some family members who need it and thereby improve the quality of life for her whole family.

She decided the business should be raising livestock because she lives in a rural area and has the right set up for this work. With her goal in mind, Mohinisso took a course called Reach Success, offered by the Association of Business Women, and earned a certificate. She is asking for a 5000 somoni loan to buy livestock.

He is in the business of raising and selling goats and sheep. He had to sell his livestock because of a lack of feed. Now he wants to buy more livestock and winter feed so that he can resell them in spring for a profit. His sons work in Russia, but they send money for their wives and children to live on, so he can not ask them for support. He contacted MDO Arvand for a loan to buy livestock. This is not his first loan from Arvand. With the help of the credit this time he plans to buy a cow to develop his business. He plans to produce milk, krut (cultured milk balls) and other milk products to sell and earn income for the wellbeing of his family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1477783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T15:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T15:40:10Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdusalom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":536.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":554.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":572.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":591.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":611.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":633.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":115.04,"local_amount":536.85,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":549.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302802},{"amount":118.82,"local_amount":554.51,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":567.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585604},{"amount":122.74,"local_amount":572.76,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":585.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081183},{"amount":126.77,"local_amount":591.6,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":605.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562062},{"amount":130.94,"local_amount":611.06,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694747},{"amount":135.69,"local_amount":633.22,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":647.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626551}],"funded_date":"2014-02-09T09:42:29Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":648841,"name":"Ines","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A $1,000 loan is offered to Ines to improve her business.

She started a small retail shop some 4 years back, but could not yield anything because of lack of capital.

With the goal of further developing the business Gulira contacted the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy foals to expand their herd. The foals will stay on their own property. In the summer the livestock are under the care of a shepherd. Gulira plans to invest income from use of the loan into further expanding her herd, and plans to save money to expand the livestock barn.

Fernando is currently attending the Universidad San Fransisco Xavier, working towards his degree in public accounting and finance. He expects to graduate in April, 2015, but without a loan is unsure how he will be able to continue affording his education. He says that his alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until he could return. Fernando says that it is important to him to graduate on time so he can enter into the job market as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Fernando plans on buying his school books. Up until now he has been managing to get by without them, but it has become a challenge.

He believes that the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer will increase his yields and he will not only get enough food for his large family but also be able to sell the surplus and invest in a business to obtain money to pay for his children\u2019s school fees and other domestic uses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1480051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum and millet.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2014-01-21T16:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T16:10:15Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":16100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":16100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":13.66,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-26T09:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1175.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240604},{"amount":93.79,"local_amount":7550,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-29T09:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8065.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517652183},{"amount":92.55,"local_amount":7450,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-23T09:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":7959,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542633092}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T16:11:55Z","paid_date":"2014-10-23T09:38:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neil Garvin","image":835015}},{"id":649173,"name":"Tom\u00e1s","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Tomas esta separado de la esposa y vive con su hija menor en la zona de Munaypata de la ciudad de La Paz,  de profesi\u00f3n protesista dental (elabora pr\u00f3tesis dentales).\n \nActualmente trabaja por mas de diez horas en su propio domicilio en un taller que instalo en la planta baja de la vivienda.

Salamat has a college education, having graduated from university with a degree in economics and management. In 2006 she married Omurbek, and is currently the loving mother of two children, and a good wife. From 2010 to 2011 she worked as an accountant and cashier for the town government. Salamat is naturally very responsible, sociable, and cheerful. She began raising animals right after marriage, specifically in 2006, with 20,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. After the land reforms and redistribution of land plots she also began to farm. Thanks to her tireless work, she now has three milk cows, eight horses, and thirty sheep. Her monthly income is 8,000 som (KGS) from milk sales. She also farms 1.8 hectares of land, where she mainly grows beans. The harvest is sold to wholesalers. With the goal of further developing the business Salamat approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cows to expand her herd. She plans to invest income from use of the loan into still further expanding her herd of livestock, and also plans to save for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1496054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T16:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T16:20:12Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":86.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salamat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":615}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":384.08,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":20111.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.92,"payment_id":561578177},{"amount":554.04,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30167.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":60.96,"payment_id":595435944}],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T16:04:28Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":659554,"name":"Maudy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maudy, de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada con Augusto quien es empleado y padre de sus 02 hijos de 3 y 2 a\u00f1os.

When he was growing up, he noticed how difficult their financial situation was for his mother, his twin brother and his older brother, Vincent, who is now deceased.  His mother, who is also deceased, worked in a flower company where she became sick.  After working there for many years, the chemicals that she worked with made her sick, and there was no cure.  \r\n\r\nWatching his mother suffer and seeing the disgust that she had for his father who never lived with them and never cared about their wellbeing, led him to become very preoccupied and anxious.  When he was 8 years old, his older brother died.  This situation was very difficult for his mother, and she cried everyday.  However, in the midst of all of this she was very strong and pushed the twin brothers ahead in primary school and high school before her passing.  \r\n\r\nThey have lived most of their  life in rented houses and it was very hard for their mother to pay the rent and their basic needs.  She was very responsible with the payments and made do with what little income she had to get him and his brother ahead.  Their mother provided them with their values and told them not to be influenced by bad friends because there is always a limit and they should set boundaries.  \r\n\r\nThanks to the efforts of his mother and the grace of God, they were able to finish high school.  Despite the financial difficulties their mom had, she always taught them that the only way to achieve a dignified and good life was through education, and without school they would not have a better future.  Their mother died in 2010, for her twin brother and him it has been difficult to get past the death of the only person who supported them emotionally and financially.  \r\n\r\nSix months ago, they started studying in Campo Alto (A college in Bogota), and they have learned a lot during this time.

Her oldest son is working in Russia. The rest of the children are in school. Ainakhan has a vocational high school education - she graduated from the vocational school for light industry in 1989, after which she worked as a technician in a sewing shop. However, once the Soviet Union fell, she stopped working and began to raise animals with her husband, starting 23 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work, she now has a milk cow, a mare, two foals, a heifer, and eighteen sheep. Her monthly income is 13,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop the business, Ainakhan contacted the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy steersto feed and then sell at the market for a profit. She plans to invest income from the loan into further expanding her livestock herd, and she also plans to save money for her son's wedding.

Geoffrey is married and has two children, both of whom are of school going age. He has been practicing farming for five years; he produces and sells milk and eggs. He also has a retail business that acts as an extra source of income. He loves poultry farming the most, and that's why he wants to invest more in it. His biggest challenge in farming is lack of funds.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they give out their loans at a low interest rate, and they also meet the needs of small scale farmers by providing them with ways in which they can acquire assets for their agricultural work. This loan will enable Geoffrey to purchase more poultry and therefore produce more eggs for sale. This will increase his income base and thus enable him cater to his children's educational needs and also improve their living

Ainur has a high school education, and to earn the primary source of income for the family she raises animals. She started 20 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work she now has two milk cows, two horses, and fifteen sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop the business she came to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a mare to expand her herd.

He plans to get involved in animal husbandry.  To start this business, he has a cowshed and experience in this type of field.  Saidaslam is requesting a loan to buy young bulls that will become the founders of this new business.  The reason for obtaining the loan is the fact that he does not have a sufficient initial capital.

He starts his day at 7am and works until all hours. Only this doesn\u2019t prevent him from doing construction on his own as well. Moussa lives in the hotel with his spouse and their 2-year-old daughter. He thus doesn\u2019t need to pay for rent or food, as he\u2019s housed and fed, but he does take care of his mother who is in the village. Moussa is a faithful client of the cooperative, as he is on his sixth loan: some previous loans have allowed him to buy part of his land.  He wishes to build, but also to have his own company and to work for himself."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1496451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

He believes that the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer will increase his yields and he will not only get enough food for his family but will also sell the surplus to obtain money to pay for his childrens' school fees."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1480975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum, and millet.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2014-01-21T19:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T19:10:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":32200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":16100,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468017219},{"amount":103.59,"local_amount":8895,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-26T09:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":8908.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479240607},{"amount":9.32,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-26T09:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":801.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504374645},{"amount":28.24,"local_amount":2425,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-29T09:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2428.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517652186},{"amount":46.35,"local_amount":3920,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-04T09:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3926.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530133710}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T16:48:41Z","paid_date":"2014-10-04T09:55:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Henderson","image":1126934}},{"id":648976,"name":"Alfred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alfred is a farmer living in Nyamira with his wife and four children, all of whom are of school-going age.

He is from the village of Vejini, in Gurjaani district. He lives with his wife, daughter and grandson. His daughter works as a cashier, and gets 250 GEL in monthly income. Demuri has been involved in agricultural business from early childhood. His parents were farmers, and this is a traditional activity for the family. He owns a vineyard and sells grapes, in season.<br \/><br \/>He wants to expand the family farming activity, so he sought credit among local financial institutions. The Start-up Program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people to get loans for starting or restarting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program, to get a loan of 3,500 GEL. He will use the loan for purchasing grape vine seedlings and expanding the vineyard, and also to purchase calves.

widow from the village of Risigaon, Nuapada district in Odisha, India. She is a very active and confident woman of 49 years. She resides in a small house with her only son and daughter-in-law. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of her husband, as head of her family Radhika with confidence took on the responsibility of managing the family and started  running a general grocery shop in her small house with items like soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, oil, etc. She started the business with a small investment of her own. At that time her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR and it was very difficult on her part to maintain the family with a small income. \r\n\r\nWhen Mahashakti started work in the area, Radhika motivated three other members of her village and formed a Joint Liability Group named Maa Patkhanda to access loans for the development of her business. Her son helped her by purchasing inventory from nearest market, six kilometers away. To date, Radhika has already accessed two loans of 10,000 and 14,000 INR and has been able to expand her business. With her increased income she also constructed a permanent stall adjoining to her house for her general store. Presently she is earning a monthly income of 5,000 INR. \r\n\r\nRadhika says this income is also not enough to make her dream of building a house for her family a reality. She wants to expand her business further, so she will utilize the present loan for purchasing items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently. She hopes that this investment will give her more income and with enough savings, she will be able to construct a house for her family. The other three members of the group are Basanti, Jamuna and Mukta who are running a general store, a Tiffin (tea) stall and an electrical repair center.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1515286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc. for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"RISIGAON, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-01-21T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Radhika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":48000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T22:32:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":659907,"name":"Arlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlyn works hard to support her family.

Laxmi is 43 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 12 years to support her family. In addition to this, Laxmi is very active in her group and is involved with a farming institute to learn new concepts of farming. She described her harvest last year as good. She hopes to continue working in this activity to grow more.\r\n\r\nWorking with this group and with People's Forum has improved Laxmi's life because she has more farm training and has been able to put aside money to feed her family. In the future, Laxmi hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to a good school.\r\n\r\nLaxmi will use her portion to cover the initial cost of purchasing seeds and fertilizer. People's Forum continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from People's Forum and the Kiva loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1515297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To purchase fertilizer and hybrid seeds of maize, paddy (rice), vegetables and small flower plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Balugaon, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-01-21T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":5375,"lender_count":148,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saras","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nalinee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarajini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sulochana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bangali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhunu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":330000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":5375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":330000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-31T04:05:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":659915,"name":"Norair","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norair is a 44-year-old married man, from Akhalkalaki district.

His wife works as a sales lady at a local store and gets a 200 GEL fixed salary. His son is unemployed, for now. The main income of the borrower and his family is a small agricultural activity. Specifically, they have 50 yielding peach trees and 30 cherry trees, and they sell the fruit, in season.<br \/><br \/>As the family has only seasonal income now, Zviad decided to start trading in fruits and vegetables throughout the year. He sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The Startup Program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people to get loans for starting or restarting businesses.

The two daughters are married, and the two sons live with their parents and help around the farm. Suusarkan has a secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Suusarkan is engaged in raising livestock and crops. She has a lot of rich experience in these areas, having begun 19 year ago with a livestock purchase of 10,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Suusarkan currently has on her farm: two dairy cows and two calves. She also has a small plot of land on which she grows  clover and corn for in-farm consumption by the cattle. Currntly, there are 400 sheaves of corn and 300 bundles of clover for the livestock. Monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Suusarkan applied to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan - to purchase
