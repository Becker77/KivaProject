Iskandar has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and the three children in their home. After purchasing his cattle, Iskandar provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Iskandar sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. Currently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and for this reason is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of $600. Iskandar thanks Kiva for the support that Kiva provides to small entrepreneurs.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tenia temor de  regresar a trabajar en  la agricultura, pero luego de un tiempo se decidi\u00f3, y aplico las t\u00e9cnicas agr\u00edcolas que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 su padre y ahora es uno de los mejores productores, pues desde hace 8 a\u00f1os cultiva  diferentes tipos de tub\u00e9rculos, adem\u00e1s de avena (pastizal), en sus terrenos propios. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta es trabajar sus tierras y mantenerlas siempre limpias y verdes, porque as\u00ed auguran una cosecha exitosa, sin embargo, le disgusta no contar con la ayuda de nadie, por eso piensa arrendar todos sus terrenos a su hermano, adem\u00e1s quiere comprar cantidad de animales menores como cuyes, gallinas y conejos pues quiere  instalar su granja.Es la d\u00e9cima vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y como es parte de la junta directiva, se siente contento de seguir trabajando con los integrantes de su banco comunal, porque son personas responsables en el pago de sus cuotas.Marcelo tiene planeado invertir el dinero solicitado en la compra de  varios sacos de abono para esparcirlos en sus cultivos, pues desea mejorar la calidad, de esta manera espera continuar progresando. ","en":"Marcelo, 65, has been separated from his partner for 21 years, but he doesn't have children so he lives alone in his own house in the company of his tenants. In his youth he was a train and truck operator in a mine site, from which he retired and immediately when to live in the city of his birth. Marcelo was afraid of going back to work in agriculture, but arrived at a point when he decided to do so and applied the agricultural techniques that his father taught him. Now he is one of the best producers in the region. For 8 years Marcelo has cultivated different types of tubers, as well as wheat (grass) on his own plots of land. What he enjoys most about his work is working on the land and keeping his crops clean and green, as this assures him of an excellent harvest. Nevertheless, he doesn't like not having anyone to help him and so he is thinking about renting his land out to his brother. Marcelo also wants to purchase a quantity of small animals, such as guinea pigs, chickens and rabbits, and to install a barn. This is the tenth time he has had a loan from MFP, and as he is part of the board of directors he feels happy to continue working with the members of his communal bank as they are very responsible people. Marcelo plans to invest this loan in the purchase of sacks of fertiliser to scatter on his crops as he wants them to be of a better quality, and in this way continue with his business.  \r\n\r\n<br

The Kiva loan will help Manohari to purchase materials for these processes so that the business can produce more stock in time for the big sale season. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":881888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood to craft children's toys and learning tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Tangal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-09-30T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manohari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1815.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691556},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1814.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647921},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667.01,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T09:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1815.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865053},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1666.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1815.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275038},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1814.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416504},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667.02,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-24T08:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1815.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131305},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1661.98,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-23T08:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1809.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947105},{"amount":114.58,"local_amount":8338,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":9080.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283296494}],"funded_date":"2011-09-30T18:46:29Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":344996,"name":"Wanjohi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wanjohi is a resident and a farmer in the Kitale area of Western Kenya.

She has been able to renovate her house and buy motorbike to facilitate the family\u2019s business. In the next round of loan, Mrs. V. would like to borrow 6.000.000 VND ($375), part of which will be used to buy bamboo for her husband to make baskets; the rest will be invested in flowers to sell in

He is married and already has 5 children.  His wife does not have a job.  She stays at home and takes care of the house, raises the children and feeds the livestock when she is able.  Yusufjon fattens and sells livestock.  The start of spring is the season for purchasing livestock for Yusufjon, because it is currently cheap.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Vaivao has 4 years of experience in this business.  Vaivao needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 110 tala or US $46 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vaivao joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Vaivao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaivao T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

There the majority of the population works in agriculture and livestock, but the younger ones have migrated to the city to look for better work opportunities.\r\n\r\nRosa is 44 years old and is a widow.  Her husband died 2 years ago of alcoholism.  Their marriage produced 5 children, who are now 22, 20, 18, 16,and 15 years old.  Her oldest son works as an mason's assistant, and helps his mother economically.  Her 20 year old daughter works in a restaurant, and also is completing distance studies during each Sunday.  Her 18 year-old son, after a long struggle, finally graduated from SECAP.  The other son, who is 16, is currently studying in secondary school.  Finally, her 15 year-old daughter works in child care and studies on Saturdays.  The whole family lives in small rooms that were built on their father's lands.\r\n\r\nRosa works in the home carrying out household chores, and she also raises pigs and poultry.  She has been a member of our institution for 7 loan cycles, and in this way she has been able to increase the number of animals that she has, so that she can later sell them and support herself.  With the new loan that she is receiving from the fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will invest in the purchase of pigs and chicken.

He has a general store where he sells all types of food such as rice, cereals, beverages, and other items.\r\n<p>\r\nPrior to having his store, Hugo operated a food stand where he sold \u201cfritadas\u201d (a traditional Ecuadorian dish made of pork, corn, and onions).  Using his savings, he decided to buy a few provisions to sell so that he could spend more time with his two children.  This turned out to be a good decision because he now has his own store where he works every day from 5:30am to 10pm.\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to generate more household income he wants to use this loan to buy rice, beverages, and canned goods for his store.

She has worked there for 9 years. She started it in the city and and has had it in the community now for three years. She is asking for the loan this time to invest in her store and buy what she needs the most, such as canned goods, sugar, milk, eggs, bread. What she needs the most is food, what people consume the most.   \r\n\r\nShe remarks that her only problem is that she has too much competition everywhere and because of this her sales can't go up. Nonetheless, she is sure that the loan will help her to have better prices to offer her customers since people always look for the best price with the best quality. So if she gives her customers lower prices her clientele will grow. \r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to have her grocery store well stocked and off course benefit the whole community with the low prices. \r\nAngelina will invest in the grocery store and the other members will invest in other activities. Carlos in an internet cafe, Guadalupe in Herbalife (teas), Mar\u00eda, Estephani, Edith and Horalia will invest in animals such as sheep, chickens, pigs and turkeys. Rosa Maria will invest in in a small store, Rubin in a stove, Catalina in clothes. \u201cWe are all very happy and grateful for the loan they have given us, since it will help us to improve our quality of life and also that of our families.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":927617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bread, milk, sugar, eggs and canned goods.

She is studying Nursing at CampoAlto.  Fabiola lives with her sister, brother-in-law, and a nephew in a bit of a difficult situation.  Her sister works during the day at the houses of other families, her brother-in-law works at a security guard station, and Fabiola works as a housekeeper who contracts out her services.  Her salary is dependent on each job.  <br \/><br \/>At home Fabiola contributes each month toward her sister\u2019s expenses, the rent payment, buying food, utility services, and transportation.  Due to these numerous expenses, there have been several months in which the only thing left she can pay is her monthly tuition.  Sometimes she hasn\u2019t been able to pay anything at all.  <br \/><br \/>Since her sister and brother-in-law do not have jobs that earn a lot of money, it has been difficult for her to obtain loans.  For this reason, she needs the help that Kiva offers.  Many times she has not been able to cover her monthly tuition payment to CampoAlto, so she has had to find extra work or seek private loans on her own in order to pay the bill.  A year ago Fabiola had to postpone her studies, but she continues to look for ways to continue her education.  She hopes to resume her studies the following semester so that she can begin her

from Tanzania! Rehema S. is a twenty-eight-year-old married woman from Dar es Salaam. Rehema owns and operates a small stall, which she established six months ago, from which she sells roasted fish. She buys fresh fish daily from local fishermen as they come in with their morning catch. Rehema roasts and sells these fish either in the fish market or along the roads of Dar. Given its location along the Indian Ocean, fish is plentiful in the waters around Dar es Salaam and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet. Rehema is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of 120 USD. She is currently requesting a loan of 225 USD in order to purchase fish in larger quantities. In the future, Rehema plans to open another stall to sell her delectable treats.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":192685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional supplies of fish in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:30:52Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T18:34:32Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":25555.56,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":26634,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356218},{"amount":22,"local_amount":24444.44,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25476,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347971},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970545},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886762},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436022},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130296},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027127},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613167},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010250},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232561}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T18:34:32Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65526,"name":"Mwanaid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanaid is 29  years old and  is married with 3 children between the ages of  9 and 2.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, catching large fish.  Fonofaavae has 3 years of experience in this business.  Fonofaavae needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing boat and a fishing net.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fonofaavae joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fonofaavae's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fonofaavae A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

These ladies believe that their 1350 Quetzales loan (an average of US $178), can launch them into the more lucrative business of Guatemalan weaving.<\/P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The loan would be used to buy fabric for their weaving. The women plan to do all the weaving themselves, and the finished fabrics would be sold in the nearby market in San Jose Poaquil.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>It is impressive how most of these women have more than one business. Portfolio diversification is a strategy they are currently managing. This shows that, even though these women live in a remote area, they have managed to learn updated and sophisticated managerial skills.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>These women hope that their future investment

Yanet has dedicated herself to a number of occupations which is how, two years ago, she began selling clothing door-to-door throughout Juliaca.  She enjoys this business because the clothing is much sought-after by local residents.  The most difficult part is moving her merchandise around to sell.  Thanks to God, she counts on the support of her children who are always close to help her with her daily sales which she carries out all day.  Yanet had to help her children get ahead single-handedly, and wants to bring them better opportunities as they grow and become men and women.

The group members average 41 years of age and five children.  They live in traditional polygamous families in the Bamanan Kin district of Kirango, in the sub-prefecture of Markala (fourth administrative region of Mali). \r\n\r\nEach belonging to the same traditional mutual-aid association and doing the same income-generating work, namely buying and selling fish and grain, the women of the Sabougnouman group decided jointly to sign up with the institution two years ago.  After having correctly repaid their two preceding loans, the group is on its third solidarity loan (group loan). \r\n\r\nThey intend to use this new loan to buy:  50 baskets of fish, 5 slabs of ice, 12 sacks of millet, 4 sacks of rice, and 2 sacks of beans.  While they get their supplies of fish from fishermen on the River Niger at the entrance of the Markala Dam, the grain is gotten from wholesale vendors at the weekly marketplace of Diamarabougou on Sundays.  If a portion of the fish is sold fresh (to women customers), the rest is smoked at home over traditional hearths designed especially for this, in order to be sold retail to bulk merchants, sometimes at the daily marketplace of Kirango Markala, in S\u00e9gou and in Bamako (the capital of Mali).  The grain is sold at the Diamarabougou marketplace to customers composed of women and men and generally in cash at the retail level. \r\n\r\nThey each hope to realize an average profit of 32,000 francs CFA each month that will be used for covering the children's school fees and to help their husbands meet family expenses.

(Tricycles are the mode of transportation in their province.) \r\n\r\nCurrently, their tricycle is not working due to problems with the wheels and some spare parts that are not functioning. Her husband has started an art and sign printing business to earn an income while the tricycle is not working. She wants to repair the tricycle, so she needs PHP 5,000 for repair and maintenance. This will be her first loan from HSPFI and if it is granted, they can have a good and comfortable living.

A retired health technician, she came into commerce thanks to her mother, who used to sell grains.  She started her income-generating business with the knitting of clothing for children, commerce in various goods, etc.  \r\n\r\nShe very soon opted for making and selling local non-alcoholic juice drinks and ice cream.  She has been in this business for a dozen years and enjoys great fame in her area, and even in the city of S\u00e9gou.  To make juices, she uses 2 kg of sugar, 4 bags of juice powder, 6 bags of vanilla sugar, and some flavorings.  \r\n\r\nIn order to buy a large-capacity freezer for satisfying her customers, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso 36 months ago.  After four solidarity loans and an individual loan, all correctly repaid, she is now on her second individual loan.  This loan will be used to buy a freezer, locally in S\u00e9gou, from merchants who specialize in household appliances. \r\n\r\nMs. D. makes her sales out of her home and door-to-door, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of men, women, and children.  She intends to realize an average monthly profit of 37,000 francs CFA that will be put into savings and covering certain family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Jypar has one son and one daughter. Both of her children go to college and don\u2019t work. At the age of 49, she works as a commander of the guard. She used to run a little farm. About a year ago she sold one calf and started selling summer hats. To spend $350 at once was a large sum for her, but she overcame her doubts and invested in hats. As a result, she earned around $200 and this allows her to pay for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nJypar has a desire to expand her business and to do that she needs a loan. With half of the loan she wants to buy men\u2019s and women\u2019s hats, and with the other half she wants to purchase children\u2019s Panama hats. She plans to get a container and achieve $1,200 turnover. As her children grow, so do her expenses for their education. Owning and running her own container would let her meet her growing needs. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Guljamal, Jailobai and Tojihon. Guljamal is 42. She has been selling women\u2019s clothes and has raised six children. Her spouse works as an unskilled laborer.

It was here we could talk with the client. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has been married for 14 years and has three children. She was born in Col\u00f3n and 5 years ago started selling Yanbal cosmetics from a catalog. Se\u00f1ora Mariuxi always has liked this business. Before she sold household items. The opportunity presented itself to start something new and with the help of her sister, she started selling Yanbal products. She learned this business and after started selling these products alone. \r\n<p>\r\nEvery month there are times when she must invest up to $500 in orders. Already she has regular clients who are very dependable in this part of the year with the most sales. \r\n<p>\r\nMariuxi is a very hard working woman who won\u2019t rest with this loan she is going to receive from the Foundacion. She is going to invest most of it in products and the other part in her boyo business (green bananas with noodles and beef) which is a typical dish from the Manab\u00ed zone. She, together with the aunt of her husband, have been working making this delicious dish for some time now. Her orders have reached 1300 bollos a week and this loan will help with these sales. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by karl baumgarten, Kiva

On average, each member receives Gs. 635,924 (approx. U$D 140) which will buy supplies and products that each member will sell in their respective business. \r\nThe hamlet's families are very poor, but still they have continued to survive and fulfill the needs that every family has thanks to the effort of the women who will take on any job to support and feed their children. \r\n\r\nThere are many women in this community like Mercedes, who is a single mother of three children. She currently collects materials to recycle, but with a loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, she was able to start a business selling \"empanadas\" (turnovers) at a street vending stand.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 230 tala or US $96 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Feri joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Feri's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Feri L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.23 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

A teacher by profession, Rustambek is also a farmer. Recognized by the people of the neighborhood as a serious man, Rustambek would like to expand his business into a viable source of income. In order to do that, he needs a loan of 10 000 Somoni to buy seeds and fertilizer to expand his crop. With part of the loan, he will buy young cattle. The income from it will help him cope with the needs of his large family. Rustambek is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan.  \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has always repaid on time because she wants to continue to make progress.\r\n\r\nJulia plans to use the funds to buy larger amounts of natural products hoping thereby to obtain increased earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":566594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy natural products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":373.49},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":387.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":405.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":425.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":443.72},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":464.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":134.46,"local_amount":373.49,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":379.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673562},{"amount":139.33,"local_amount":387.04,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":393.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887381},{"amount":84.47,"local_amount":234.63,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":238.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154392},{"amount":61.35,"local_amount":170.43,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":173.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449694},{"amount":313.08,"local_amount":869.66,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":884.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588396},{"amount":167.31,"local_amount":464.75,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":472.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724889}],"funded_date":"2010-07-17T20:41:55Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":217986,"name":"Mrs. Norm Ouch Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan has 19 people who live in Trapeang Dang Tuek village in Takeo province.

Leena wants to help her husband in purchasing some medical equipment for the laboratory, but the amount of money she has is not enough to pay for it.  So she needs to take a loan in the amount of $2,000 from FATEN.  When Leena gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, that will enable her to help her husband get the medical equipment.  This equipment will help to expand and improve his work and increase his income which will help to provide better life conditions for the family.  Leena is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead in his laboratory.

The income she earns from this works provides her children with an education and helps to get more products to prepare and sell.  This is her first loan with the institution, and it will help her to be able to buy materials to diversify the range of products she offers her clients.  Investments like this have helped her in the past and will give her what is necessary to help her continue.  \r\n<P><B>Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\nActualmente

In addition she makes and sells clothes such as g\u00fcipiles (traditional Guatemalan weavings) with specific designs from the area of San Pedro. \r\n\r\nShe originally started making and selling candles in San Pedro, where she lives, but then began to sell them in nearby towns like Chimaltenango, Pachalum, and San Antonio Aguas Calientes. When she has time, she always weaves at home. \r\n\r\nAs her business has grown, Marta sees the potential that more capital can offer. In spite of the economic situation, she has continued working hard and struggling, although her candle workshop still lacks many things. With her loan she will invest in purchasing materials such as wax, the basic material used to make the candles. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the cost of the thread that she uses to make the g\u00fcipiles has risen. She would like to use part of her loan to purchase thread in bulk so that she has enough materials to meet the demands of her clients who continue to place orders. Her goal is to continue moving forward so that she can provide for her children and improve their situation day by day. \r\n\r\nTranslated from Spanish by Andrea Bouch, Kiva Fellow\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Marta desde muy peque\u00f1a junto a su familia se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n de candelas y veladoras tambi\u00e9n a la venta y elaboraci\u00f3n de tejidos como g\u00fcipiles San Pedranos. El tejido siempre lo hace en casa. El negocio elaborar y vender las candelas lo inicio en el pueblo de San Pedro donde ella vive, pero luego empez\u00f3 en otros pueblos como Chimaltenango, Pachalum, y San Antonio Aguas Calientes. Por tal motivo ve la necesidad de mas capital, a pesar de la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica siguen luchando pero faltan muchas cosas aun para invertir en el taller donde fabrican las candelas y veladores, necesita mas capital para comprar parafina que es el material b\u00e1sico para las candelas. Tambi\u00e9n el hilo para los g\u00fcipiles ha subido por tal motivo desea comprar mas ya que siempre sus manos no han descansado en hacerlos ya que tiene clientes que le hacen pedidos a quienes entrega lo que piden. Su meta es salir adelante para que sus hijos tengan lo necesario y que pueda mejorar cada d\u00eda. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":295162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Materials for candle-making and weaving","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2009-03-27T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35980447},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44441245},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-22T09:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63169028},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-26T08:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73594358},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-24T09:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87029826},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-20T09:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110796861},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118068281},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136665910},{"amount":76.88,"local_amount":615,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":624.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159753645},{"amount":163.14,"local_amount":1305.11,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1324.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172712582},{"amount":134.98,"local_amount":1079.89,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1096.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396361}],"funded_date":"2009-03-27T22:43:53Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:45:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":102434,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina is 49 years old and a resident of San Juan, Quirino, Isabela.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sala  joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sala 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sala  T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.54 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.66 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Experienced and talented in the business, she has expanded her business into a successful trade, supporting her family of three children.\r\n\r\nThroughout the last year, IMON International has provided assistance to Mavdjuda\u2019s business through microfinance loans. Committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Mavdjuda has used her previous loan wisely and has repaid each with a perfect credit history. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 5,000 Somoni to replace her depleted inventory, hoping to continue expanding her business and support her family.    \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Anvar is a hard-working entrepreneur from Dushanbe, Tajikistan. He has operated his own car repair business for the past three years.

Anvar works hard to earn a good income and support his family. He and his wife have two children. Anvar has requested a short-term loan of 2000 Somoni to buy some tools that he needs for his business. The income from this loan will help him pay for the schooling expenses for his children. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bokong Village is situated about 27 km and a two-hour drive from Kupang City. The community in this village, including the group members, leans on agricultural products to support their family lives. They also depend on animal husbandry (pigs, chickens and cows) when meeting family needs for a particular moment (e.g. they could sell their livestock to pay a child\u2019s education fees or when one of their family members is unwell).\r\n\r\nMost of community in Bokong Village has a background in farming. They usually sell their agricultural products, such as bananas, coconuts and beans, at Inpres Market. The challenge that the community faces in running their businesses is the lack of public transport to reach Inpres market as it only available three days a week, whereas the local market in this area only operates on Tuesdays. \r\n\r\nMekobaun A2 Group is led by Petrus A., a 60-year-old farmer. Petrus is respected by the group members as he has the ability to lead and also has constructive thoughts. He was born and grew up in Bokong Village. He is married to Agustin and they have five children: Jumlina A., who is 33, graduated from University and married; Sarce, who is 29 and working in Malaysia; Becy A., who is 26 and a senior high school graduate who spends her days helping her parents on the farm; Julianus A., who is a 24-year-old junior high school graduate and motorcycle taxi driver; and Welem A. , who is 22 and in the third semester of the university.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill his family's daily needs, Petrus plants cassavas, corns, bananas and beans. His family is relying on the agricultural products and this is the reason why Petrus should work hard. Currently, Petrus has to finance Welem\u2019s education at the university. Petrus also raises pigs and goats to be sold so he can pay his son\u2019s education fees. Petrus' wife, Agustin, also helps him to generate more income by weaving cloth to be sold but the income generated by Petrus and Agustin is not enough to meet their family's needs.     \r\n\r\nPetrus got information that TLM Foundation provides loans to assist poor farmers like him. Together with the other community members who are interested in joining the program, they formed a group to receive a loan so they can buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. Petrus is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,400,000 from TLM to buy young cattle. The other group members are also requesting a loan to buy young cattle. They hope the profits that will be generated in the future will help them in improving their living standard and providing a better future for their children. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":374352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bokong","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-08-22T05:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Nikodemus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nikolas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yakobus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosep","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":27000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":27000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2700,"local_amount":27000000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27054023.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177483712}],"funded_date":"2009-08-23T14:15:55Z","paid_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":135257,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice sells provisions and food.

Rahoof would like to thank both AFS and Kiva lenders that support the people around the world through their effective process.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":414244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchasing construction materials to build his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AF","country":"Afghanistan","town":"Kabul Afghanistan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33 65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":34,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohammad Rahoof","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AFN","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4163}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":8334,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8470.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110634160},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118031173},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123870079},{"amount":85.43,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128902894},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136631002},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144665654},{"amount":85.43,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151849156},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159587704},{"amount":85.43,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166797685},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172067179},{"amount":85.34,"local_amount":4163,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4231.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177358257}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T01:50:59Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:55:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":151744,"name":"Shine In Allah Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariama is forty three years old.

He is 33; married; and the father of 6 children who are 15, 12, 9, 6, 4, and 2.  Of these, 4 of them are in school.  He only studied through 5th grade and didn't continue due to his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home in Boane with his family and supports his mother by sending her money.  He left Boane for Swaziland to look for a job.  After facing several difficulties, he decided to return to Mozambique 2 years later.  He currently has some farmland and has 4 workers.  He grows and sells vegetables (green beans and cabbage) along with his wife.  He has done this activity since 2002 and makes about 45,000 meticais a quarter and saves some in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through neighbors who are also clients of the same institution.  This is his 4th loan and it is for 30,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy supplies and to pay his workers to produce vegetables (potatoes, peppers, cucumbers, etc) as a way to satisfy his customers.  His previous loans were for 12,000, 16,000, and 20,000 meticais, and they were all used for the same purpose.  In the future he hopes to request more loans to be able to increase his farmland and introduce new crops.  This is why he promises to pay back his loan on time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva
