After the death of her husband, Kulumbu was unable to cope for a long time with the death of her loved one. It was necessary to raise the children and get them on their feet, and Kulumbu decided to take the farm and material responsbility into her own hands. Kulumbu has a higher education. As a main source of income for her family, Kulumbu raises livestock, having begun 24 years ago with a livestock purchase of 1,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Kulumbu today has on her farm: 32 sheep and 37 goats, and has all the conditions for tending livestock. Twice a year, she sheers wool from the sheep and goats, delivers it to producers for preparation of woolen yarn, and gets a certain income.

Two of her older children are college students, and two younger are school students.  Elmira has a higher education.  She graduated from a university with the profession of a physics teacher.  At the present time, she works as a teacher at the local village school.  She has an analytic mind.  Unfortunately, her salary is not enough for consumer and family needs.  To provide additional income for her family, Elmira is involved in animal husbandry, having started 21 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Elmira's hard work, today her business contains 4 dairy cows, 4 horses and 25 sheep.  Her husband also works as a school teacher and helps Elmira with the business in his free time.  They keep livestock at home in the winter, where they have all of the conditions for keeping livestock, and take it out to a pasture in the summer.   The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy mares in order to increase livestock headcount.  Elmira plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to repair her

In the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make living. \r\n\r\nSo, Tsiala decided to start a home products trading business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from  borrowers. Tsiala has a great desire to be involved in a trading business. She couldn\u2019t receive a loan from local financial institutions, because of their requirements to have business experience. However, the Start Up program, a joint product of Kiva and Credo, began with a program that allows rural poor people like Tsiala to have the chance of starting a business. \r\n\r\nShe requested a loan of 600 USD to begin trading with home products. She plans to go to Turkey and purchase the products at wholesale prices and then resell among her friends and villagers. This will give her a chance to earn income and become financially independent.

She is a homemaker and a farmer. She has a high school degree and graduated as a trade expert and public accountant. Currently, she doesn't work in her profession due to the lack of jobs in the area. For more than 4 years, she has been making a living planting and growing coffee in the fields. At an early age, her parents taught her the different techniques to perform this job. Every day, she works hard in the fields because her son is her priority. She works so that he doesn't lack anything and so she can help him in the future so that he is better prepared academically.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to implement technology to her coffee crops, expand, and plant a different variety. Her dream, from the income generated by her job, is to improve her family's quality of life, mainly that of her son. She sees a better future for him and every day she works hard for him alongside her relatives.\r\n\r\nTherefore, today she is requesting financing for the purchase of fertilizers, cleaners, and to pay for labor costs. Thanks to this financing, Dina hopes to obtain higher revenues and an excellent yield as a result of the work she wants to do through this financing.

He will use the loan to perform maintenance so he can continue with his work as it is the only source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nJusto\u2019s dream is to someday change or update his vehicle so that he can improve his financial income.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that he has applied for a loan through IMPRO and the first time with Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1496433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

His major customer is the tea factory which buys all his tea. In addition to tea farming Barnabas also owns a butchery that gives him additional income which he uses to cater for the needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe would like to use the loan money of two million (2,000,000) Ugandan shillings to buy fertilizer, so that he can boost the fertility of the soil and hence harvest more tea. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to expand his business in future and he believes that then his profits will be much more than what he gets presently. Unfavourable weather is his major challenge since this affects his gardens, especially in the rainy season.

As he can\u2019t find a job, he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Theimuraz applied for credit from MFO Credo (Micro Finance Organization Credo). His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $2000 will help Theimuraz to purchase a secondhand car. He will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them inter-city.

From a young age, she wanted to study medicine or another career in the health field because she always liked helping others, and believes that it is the career for her.  In 2012, she graduated from high school but was not able to enroll in medical school because she did not have the necessary resources to put together the money she needed.  Instead, she decided to study nursing and chose this prestigious institution because it seemed like a great place.  However, she was not able to enroll in her first semester because she did not have enough money for tuition or room and board.  She also has a two year old daughter, and was not able to find anyone to take care of her while she was in school.  She is not able to work and does not have the sufficient funds to pay for her education.  Meanwhile, her parents and her boyfriend help her with her and her child's expenses.  Her mother works during the day and tries her best to save and earn enough money to make her daughter's dream possible.\r\n\r\nLiszy Estefani was able to enter school to become a nursing assistant.  After six months, she was able complete her first semester of nursing assistant school.  She is very happy because she is close to reaching her goal.  She has learned many things about precautions, protections and how to be a good nurse.

He is divorced and has 1 child aged 6 years, who is currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ibrahim established his electrical business. He was a sales assistant to his brother but when the shop was closed, he could not get employment elsewhere, so he decided to run his own business out of the little savings he made. Ibrahim works at the business 6 days per week, from 7:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m. He says that the main challenge to his business is the high cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nIbrahim requires a loan in order to buy more chargers, extensions and cables for resale. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to renovate his house and increase his business. In the future, Ibrahim plans to build a permanent business place. He thanks you for your

He is married with three children between the ages of 1 and 12 years. Two of his children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ibrahim established a food items business.

He is happy about attracting new clients but on the other hand, the financial challenge of meeting customers' demands is hindering his business progress and growth. He said he needs to fill his store with more food products to serve his customers.\r\n\r\nSo he applied for a youth loan of 200,000 YER from AMB to buy more grocery products to sell.

She lives in a village and from an early age, she has been involved in handicrafts.  Today she is a true master at work, making embroidered national costumes.  Her efforts have led her to learn all the intricacies of her work and to teach a number of apprentices.  From the moment she started her work, Manzura has made a habit of fulfilling orders to a very high quality.\r\n\r\nManzura's husband is a builder.  Their married life is happy and they are trying to raise their children to be good people.  Her eldest son is in medical school.

She and her husband are raising two children.  She has a secondary education and is involved in agriculture, an activity which constitutes her family's main source of income.  She essentially grows vegetables, which she started doing 16 years ago with an initial capital of 5,000 som.  Thanks to Gulmira's hard work, her farm now consists of 0.24 hectares of land and she cultivates early cucumbers, onions and potatoes on a yearly basis, for the family's consumption as well as for resale.\r\n\r\nGulmira takes care of her farm practically by herself.  Her husband is a private builder who works on construction sites during the building season and helps his wife with the farm-work during the off-season.  Gulmira makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan to buy cucumber and tomato seeds, as well as fertilizers and pesticides.  With the earnings from her loan Gulmira plans to improve her family's financial situation and, ultimately, their living conditions.  In the future, she and her husband would like to build a greenhouse on their property.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1514419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

old and married. She and her husband are raising three children. She has a specialized secondary education and is now a homemaker, raising her children and taking care of the house.  She is also involved in agriculture and animal husbandry, an activity which constitutes her family's main source of income.  She started in this field 12 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS).  She now owns 1.14 hectare of land on which she grows clover, beans and maize annually for the family's consumption as well as for resale.\r\n\r\nElnura makes a monthly income of 16,000 som (KGS).

Chichicastenango, Guatemala. It is composed of thirteen motivated women who formed the group five years ago. As the ladies have excellent credit history, they are comfortable and excited to apply for a new loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. They will use their loans investing in their businesses, which mostly involve textile production.\r\n\r\nMaria is the 23-year-old Secretary of the Trust Bank. Her fellow Trust Bank members chose her to occupy this position as she has had six years of education and has good Spanish reading and writing skills. Maria is the youngest member of the Trust Bank! She is a weaver and has requested a new loan which she will use to purchase various types of thread to produce more textiles. She will also use a small portion of the loan for her husband\u2019s business. He sells cellphone accessories and parts. The couple works very hard each day so that they can meet the basic needs of their family including providing nutritious foods and education.\r\n\r\nMaria, along with the other ladies in the Trust Bank, really appreciated the opportunities realized during their first loan cycle, and they are quite excited about this second loan cycle. Besides receiving and making payments on their loans, the women participate in monthly trainings on various topics like effective business administration, health and nutrition, and self-esteem. This month\u2019s topic involves budgeting administration.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank are so thankful to Kiva investors throughout the world who are helping them move ahead in their lives. They look forward to a brighter future as empowered women, creating better lives for themselves, their families, and their community of Chichicastenango.

Gulsaana has a college education and married Rakhmadild after she graduated from the Pedagogical Institute. Her spouse is an independent construction worker and she teaches at the local school. Three of her daughters and her son are married and live at home, and her youngest daughter is a student. In order to earn additional income for her family, Gulsaana raises livestock and plants crops. She started 19 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Gulsaana now has two dairy cows, two horses, two young bulls, 20 sheep, and 1.5 hectares of irrigated land where she plants beans and potatoes and gets a good harvest. She earns 13,000 som (KGS) per month from milk sales and her husband's seasonal income. With the goal of expanding her farm, Gulsaana asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a horse to increase her livestock numbers. She plans to use the profits to purchase additional domestic animals.

They are very motivated to succeed and look forward to their monthly meetings where they also receive trainings on subjects like effective business practices, indebtedness, women\u2019s health, children\u2019s nutrition and self-esteem. Almost all of them have had very little or no formal education.\r\n\r\nFermina is the 36-year-old Secretary of the Trust Bank. She is married and has five children. As three of the children are still dependent on Fermina and her husband, the couple makes many sacrifices so that they can meet the basic needs of the children. They realize that education is a vital key to their successful futures and so the couple works hard. Fermina fabricates palm mats and delivers 50 each week to the local market. She is requesting a new loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to invest in additional palm material for the mats as well as other materials. Fermina wants to take advantage of this time of the year to buy quantities of raw materials because this is the most economical time to make purchases as costs are down.\r\n\r\nEach of the ladies in the Trust Bank is most grateful to Kiva investors and Friendship Bridge for this vital support which is really a lifeline for them. With these loans, the women can maintain or grow their businesses. With the monthly trainings, they can arm themselves with new knowledge to live their lives. The combination of loans and education is a winning one for the ladies of the Cruzche Trust Bank. They are able to step more confidently and empowered into a brighter future and create a better life for themselves, their families and their community.

Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education, and in her personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRegina dreams of buying a new house and lot, and she hopes that her business will continue to flourish.

She will later make it and sell it. \r\n\r\nWorking in this manner enables her to generate income to support her family as she is single and has three children.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she said that she enjoys the loans, the health and the training that the institution offers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1515440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice and noodles wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-01-22T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lola Cristina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Livia Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15980,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1190.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1518.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1558.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1580.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1602.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1624.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1645.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1668.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2052.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":173.18,"local_amount":1190.3,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1196.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449642000},{"amount":444.69,"local_amount":3056.36,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:59:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3072.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459108938},{"amount":456.8,"local_amount":3139.66,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3156.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467923989},{"amount":469.43,"local_amount":3226.46,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144835},{"amount":482.22,"local_amount":3314.38,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3331.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838564},{"amount":298.68,"local_amount":2052.84,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2063.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264596}],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T02:18:12Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T13:16:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diana Lima","image":830085}},{"id":660209,"name":"Elsie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsie is 34 years old and lives in Poblacion, Titay, Zamboanga Sibugay.

She admitted this fact: that if her husband worked alone for their family, then he would not be able to meet the household expenses and the educational needs of their children. This is the reason she started tailoring at home \u2013 to support her family. She has been running a tailoring business for five years to help support her family. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.With Christmas upcoming, she has a heavy burden of work. To cope with the demand she has need of reels, thread, packs of buttons, laces, zippers, etc. Therefore, she has requested a loan from Kiva field partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase these items. In this way, she will be able to stitch up more dresses. Jozfain hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving a good quality education to her children through all her hard work in her business. Jozfain is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

For three years, Asia has been running a beauty salon, and she wants to purchase some more cosmetic products and chairs for her beauty salon. \r\n\r\nFor that reason, Asia has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan. When she makes a profit, first of all she will repay the loan amount to Kiva and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is much too congested.

In order to meet the increasing demands of her customers, she is interested in buying a larger variety of cosmetic products for the parlor.

During the disbursement, one member couldn't attend because she had a religious ceremony in her temple.\r\n\r\nNi Ketut, as the head, personally feels the benefits from the pig breeder program. With the eight loans, the profit helped her income to fullfill her daily needs and also some savings. Although she still needs the loan, she and the members of Putri Mandiri group keep their spirit to maintain the business. In this loan, she will use it to purchase five superior piglets and feed. She will also use her own money because the price for piglets is quite expensive now. \r\n\r\nThe Putri Mandiri group hopes the cooperation between MUK, Kiva, lenders and the group runs smoothly and

This can be seen from the level of sales and livestock populations they have maintained.\r\n\r\nKetut has even been able to increase the population of her pigs. Ketut is very grateful for all that she has from her business and her family. She said she is very happy about her situation now, but she still needs a new loan to further improve business again.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully paying off the last loans, they proceed to the next period with the purpose to improve their businesses. Ketut, head of the group, is coordinating members in the purchase of piglets so that all members get good piglets. With the loan, she will buy super quality feed for her sows and piglets to make sure they grow healthily. \r\n\r\nIn this period, besides increasing the loan size, there\u2019s a change in the Sambi Ternak membership.

She is living in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her husband, 3 daughters and 2 sons. Her husband is a carpenter by profession but his monthly income is not enough to fulfill the household expenses of his family. Therefore for the past 4 years, in addition to carpentry he also drives taxi at night. Currently he is not able to generate any income from the taxi, as its engine is not working properly and needs to be repaired. Farhat Gul has requested a loan from Kiva partner BRAC Pakistan for the amount of repairing the engine in her husband's taxi. With the profits her husband wants to open a new carpentry shop in the future. Farhat Gul desires to provide a quality education to her children and she prays for the good health of her family and for the growth of her husband's business. She is very thankful to

cost of feed and making her payment. She\u2019s really happy for that and has decided to continue her loan to increase the population of her pigs. All the profit will be used for her family's daily needs and school fees.\r\n\r\nTo improve the quality of livestock, the Sari Mertha Group continue its lending. This loan will be used to buy super quality piglets for fattening.

The pigs will be maintained for six months. She hopes the pigs' growth will be healthy and the ideal weight will be achieved.

He is married to Lucy, a housekeeper and mother to his child. By the grace of God, Luisito has managed to support his child's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to continually send his child to school to finish his\/her degree.\r\n\r\nLuisito oversees operations of their Jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have a Jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which pays a boundary (daily quota) each day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new tires for the Jeepney, and renew his registration. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nLuisito hopes to acquire another Jeepney and dreams that his family will always be in good health. He meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week.\r\n\r\n- Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

Her husband works in the United States in order to give a better future to their four children. The eldest is 20 and finished high school, the daughter is sixteen and finishing high school, and the youngest two are twins who go to primary school. Norma grows coffee and has been doing so for many years, which means she knows everything about caring for the plants, harvesting the crops, using manure and fertilisers, etc. She owns a plot of land, a small part of which she inherited from her parents, the rest of which she acquired thanks to her own labour. She sells her coffee to middlemen who come to her village to buy it. Her land is 30 minutes away from her house on foot, 10 minutes by car. When the time for harvesting comes, her whole family helps, in order to reduce costs and increase profits. Norma's main goal is to double her production in order to be more stable financially, so as to support her children during their studies and pay for household expenses, which would mean her husband would not need to work abroad any more. Her greatest wish is to see her family living under the same roof again. She asks for a loan in order to care for her crops: she needs to buy fertiliser and manure, and wants to hire farm hands in order to increase her production and, thus, her income, so as to reach her goals and fulfill her dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1496553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies and to hire farm hands to help her harvest her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1425,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":29077.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467895366}],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T15:30:35Z","paid_date":"2014-04-16T11:41:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":660244,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is married to a farmer who owns a banana farm in their village.

Ilham lives in Cibubur, a suburban area located about 30 minutes from Jakarta, the capital city. He is married to a kindergarten teacher. From their marriage, they have a child who's still a toddler. \r\n\r\nIlham owns a small stall that sells mobile phone accessories and mobile phone airtime credits. Ilham joined Ruma because he was interested in selling mobile phone airtime credits. He also thinks that Ruma's business is innovative so he wants to gain more knowledge from it. As his business continues, he needs a working capital loan from Kiva to process more transactions especially on weekends when more people tend to come to his stall.

What I like most about ICP is that students don\u2019t just study political science and history but also learn to think critically and find solutions to complicated political issues. I want to help Kyrgyzstan develop as it faces many big challenges in the future such as climate change and political influence from Russia and China.\r\n\r\nOne of the people who inspired me to study ICP is my uncle. After graduating this department at AUCA, he won a full scholarship to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., specializing in Central Asian security studies. For him AUCA was the first step to success and I would like to follow his path.\r\n\r\nI am communicative; I like to meet people from different countries and share Kyrgyz culture with them.

them.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1515790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
