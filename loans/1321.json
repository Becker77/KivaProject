hard-working and cheerful woman.  She is married with six children.  All her family are very close and they live in a village.  Since she has a large family, Izzat and her husband have to work hard to bring in enough money to take care of their children.  Izzat has been working with Arvand for several years now, receiving loans to help grow her business.  She is involved in agriculture.  Next to her home she has a plot of land on which she grows wheat, which she then sells to make her income.  In the future, she would like to start raising livestock so she can sell their meat and milk, but at the moment she needs to buy seeds to sow her wheat.  This is why she has turned to Arvand to receive a loan to buy these seeds.  Izzat is hoping for good results and she thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1493115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is not married and he lives with his parents.  He has a high school education and as the main source of income for his family, he raises livestock together with his parents.  They started this business five years ago with the purchase of livestock for 15,000 som KGS.  Thanks to Abduvali's hard work, their farm now has two dairy cows and 50 sheep.  Their monthly income is 6,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing the business further, Abduvali has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy sheep so they can increase their head of livestock.  He plans to reinvest the income from this loan back into the business to further increase the size of their herd."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1496160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chongara village, Batken region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T13:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T13:20:05Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":244.85,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abduvali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":923.4,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50279.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.6,"payment_id":595435947},{"amount":881.75,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50279.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":143.25,"payment_id":681290734}],"funded_date":"2014-02-18T16:10:45Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T12:49:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":649509,"name":"Madalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madalena is a Ugandan married woman, age 29, living in Kagadi, Uganda.

in school. She is engaged in the activity of selling dry and fresh fish in the market which is four kilometers away from her village. Her husband catches fish from a small part of the Chilika Lake which is near their village (Chilika is a famous lake in Odisha known for the migratory birds). The demand for fish in the region is very high as it is consumed by most of the people. Jhuna makes dried fish by keeping fish in sunlight until all the water in them gets evaporated which preserves them for future use (like when fish are not available in the market, in the rainy season). Dried fish is also used as a supplement to fresh fish. \r\n\r\nJhuna is requesting a loan to buy a cool storing box for keeping fish, fishing net and insecticides to prevent fish from decaying for her fishery\/fish selling business. She says that this will help her in strengthening the business and responding to client demand.\r\n\r\nThis group is made up of neighbors and friends who formed the group Padmalaya Self Help Group (SHG). The members of the group have selected Jhuna as their president. The lady standing sixth from right in the photo is Jhuna. The common goal of the group is to increase their business activity.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1496136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a cool storing box for keeping fish, fishing net and insecticides to prevent fish from decaying for her fishery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Tangi, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T13:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T13:20:06Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudeshna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annapurna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subhadra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sharia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nepali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T14:04:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":660262,"name":"Manas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manas is a freshman in the International and Business Law program; this is his story:\r\n\r\nTo study International and Business Law at AUCA has been my goal since I started thinking about going to university.

A lot of the instability is because we do not have a strong legal system to enforce contracts. I want to help build this system because I am sure that we can bring in more investment for our economy, our education, and our society.\r\n\r\nAUCA is the most prestigious and the most popular university in Central Asia. It teaches with modern methods and has advanced technologies to train students. I would like to study at AUCA in order to strengthen my knowledge, so that I can contribute to the future of my country.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1515794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The monthly income is 6,500 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Nurila turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows to feed and subsequently sell at the market at a higher price. Nurila plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1496225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cows for fattening and reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Yizar village,  Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":923.4,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50279.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.6,"payment_id":595435949}],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T03:55:59Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":649305,"name":"Fatima Karen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima wants to become an accountant.

She plans on graduating in June, 2014 but without a loan from Vittana she fears that she will need to defer her graduation. This fee is often more expensive than the semester's tuition and is a frequent impediment for graduating students in La Paz. With a career in hospitality, Liduvina expects to earn $15 a day. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Liduvina's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, her parents never had the chance to increase their earning potential. Because of this, the family's finances have always been tight.

He is married and has four children. He has a very friendly family. They live in a village. In order to have enough income for the family, all family members are trying to somehow make money. Everyone works as they can. Not long ago, Asatullo married away his oldest son and spent a large share of his savings on holding the wedding. \r\n\r\nAsatullo works with cattle breeding and dekhan farming. He grows fruit and vegetables in his small garden. Even if it is a seasonal business, it still brings Asatullo an income. Asatullo's main and most stable business is cattle breeding. He breeds and sells cattle. His wife helps him with the business. She cares for the cattle and also sells the milk they give. \r\n\r\nAsatullo needs to purchase a few additional heads of cattle to breed and subsequently resell.

She lives with her husband and four children. Her husband is a mechanic who fixes vehicles in a workshop. In order to supplement the family income Pecha opened a variety shop in the market area. She sells 3000 to 4000 INR every day. In order to generate more income she keeps fresh vegetables from her own kitchen garden to fill up the store. \r\n\r\nApart from the variety store, from time to time Pecha also sells women's clothes. She buys things at a lower price and sells them to get little extra profit. Pecha says, she and her husband have to work very hard to sustain the family and to send their children to school to get an education like other children.

He enjoys dairy farming the most, as it earns him more income. The main challenges he faces are diseases affecting his livestock.\r\n\r\nWycliff chose Juhudi Kilimo because he has seen other beneficiaries of Juhudi Kilimo loans in his local area and he decided to try it out. During the training offered, he learned that Juhudi is a micro-finance organization which finances farmers with short term loans. His highest monthly expense is school fees, and so through the dairy loan he will earn more income and thus be able to take care of his children's school fees. He appreciates Juhudi Kilimo for granting him the

She is married and has raised three children with her husband.  All of her children live on their own, and one grandson lives with her.  Kulushay has a high school education and her outlook on life is optimistic.  She knows exactly what she wants and she goes after it with all her strength.  She knows how to use and budget money to reach her goals.  \r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Kulushay works raising livestock.  She started this business 23 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, she now has two dairy cows, three calves and 14 sheep.  She has everything she needs to keep the animals, including a barn and a pasture for roaming.  Her dairy cows spend all year on the farm and Kulushay looks after them herself, and the sheep are tended by a shepherd from March to October while they roam in the pasture.  She has enough hay and feed to provide for the animals.  Her monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of developing her business further, Kulushay has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy calves so she can increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use the money from the loan to further increase her head of livestock, as well as to save up money to finish some building work in progress on her

She has a high school education and she raises livestock, which is the main source of income for her family.  She started six years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, Karkyra now has two dairy cows, as well as a .2 hectare plot of land on which she grows peppers, beans and clover.  Her monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Karkyra has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy bulls.  She will buy the bulls, fatten them up for two months and on the third month she will sell them at a profit at the local market.  She plans to use the income from this to further increase her head of livestock, as well as to save up money to buy some appliances for her

Nowadays, due to household expenses, he does not have enough to buy scrap goods and does not have a stock of scrap to sell for getting money. Therefore, Lubna requested a loan for her husband, so he can buy scrap goods, establish his enterprise, and make some savings to meet sudden needs or incidents. \r\n\r\nLubna is very impressed with this honorable support and shows her wish to take more loans after the payment of this loan.

Her oldest daughter is a dentist, the second is a college student, and the boy is in 11th grade. Shaarbubu has a high school education. To provide the primary source of income for the family Shaarbubu raises livestock. She began 15 years ago with the purchase of 6,000 som (KGS) of animals. Thanks to her tireless work, she now owns three milk cows and twenty-five sheep. Her monthly income is 3,200 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nExpanding her herd increases her income and the wellbeing of the family, so Shaarbubu came to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy calves. She plans to invest her earnings from use of the loan into further increasing the number of livestock she has, and she also plans to save for her son's continuing education, since he will graduate high school next year and intends to enter medical school.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1497054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T15:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T15:40:20Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":50.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shaarbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":25157.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178400},{"amount":462.01,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25157.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":50.49,"payment_id":595435951}],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T17:46:27Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:31:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":649499,"name":"Ulukbu","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0423\u043b\u0443\u043a\u0431\u0443 43 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0423\u043b\u0443\u043a\u0431\u0443 -

As a main income for her family, Ulukbu works with livestock breeding, after having started this business 18 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ulukbu's persistent work, her farm currently has three dairy cows, three sheep and one stallion. The monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Ulukbu turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows to fatten and subsequently resell at the market at a higher price.

She does her sewing at home, where she makes Tajik women's dresses to order. Zulaykho began working as a seamstress six years ago, and has continued up to this day. She uses an old sewing machine, but is asking for a loan to buy a new, modern one. A new machine would allow her to sew better and faster.

This business has returned her about 40,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth cycle for Chrib with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She successfully paid back her previous loan which has provided her family with a better living. Now she leads the group of three and the total requesting loan amount for her entire group is 3,600,000 KHR, of which 1,400,000 KHR is her loan portion. As the group leader, Chrib is going to use her loan portion to pay for a reaping fee. She hopes that she will collect her yield on time with good income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1515752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay for reaping fee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Moung Russey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-01-22T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chrib","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1800000},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":128.47,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":513745.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479283873},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":616494.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530249631},{"amount":282.64,"local_amount":1100000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1130239.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542684335},{"amount":359.72,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1438486.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595342996}],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T07:49:54Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T16:20:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":660322,"name":"Maa Tarini Shg (H) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A portion of this group loan will go to support \"Kabita\".

Now Nodira and her husband want to make repairs to their home, which has fallen into an unsuitable state. The floors, roof and windows need to be replaced. However, it will take a lot of money.

He does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy a new body and seat covers. He wants to start driving, but is looking for a lump sum amount to buy a rickshaw body. Therefore, Hajira requested a loan for her husband so he can buy a new rickshaw body and can drive the rickshaw smoothly. \r\n\r\nHajira hopes that her husband will now be able to generate more income

The family is involved in agricultural activities. They have a cow, three other cattle and 18 beehives. Tengiz also cultivates a plot of land and sells the products locally. However, the total family income is so small that they live in poverty and receive social assistance from the government. Tengiz has a great desire to improve his family's living conditions by starting a new activity.

She has a high school education and she began her working life in 1981 as a cook, becoming a cook in a medical center in 1984, where she works to this day.  As an extra source of income for her family, Ryskul raises animals.  She started doing this 29 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 1,000 KGS.

","en":"Raima is a 57-year-old widow with three children.  After her husband died, Raima struggled for a long time with the death of someone so close to her.  She needed to raise and care for her children, so she decided to take the household and the material responsibilities of her family into her own hands.  She has been involved in raising livestock since 2008, a business she started with 20,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her tireless work and support, Raima now earns a monthly income of 12,000 KGS.  Her farm now has four dairy cows and a small apple orchard, which brings a decent income.  In the fall, Raima and her children gather the apple harvest and sell the fruit at the local market for extra money.  With the goal of increasing her livestock, Raima has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy sheep for resale.  She plans to use the income from this to further increase her head of livestock and to improve the material conditions of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1498327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been working for 25 years.  When her husband became ill and couldn\u2019t work, she endeavored to look after her children and to be the breadwinner for her family.  At first she did crocheting and knitting at home, selling the items to her neighbors and her circle of friends.  Later she began selling at the market.  Alongside the knitted items, she began selling vegetables.  She would also go to fairs.  \r\n\r\nWhen the municipality opened an arcade for handicrafts sellers, Melahat applied and was accepted.  For the last seven years, she has made and sold handicrafts in the arcade.  Thanks to her work, she has made a living and raised her children.  All of her children except for her younger son are now married; Melahat wants to marry him off, too.  \r\n\r\nBecause she didn\u2019t have capital, she couldn\u2019t buy materials.  With the loan she gets from Maya, she\u2019ll be able to buy materials and supplies, and she\u2019ll be able to offer a greater variety of products.  With the tulle and lace she is going to buy, she will sew doily and tablecloth sets, and increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nHer only hope is not to lose her health. As long as she is in good health, she wants to continue working.  She wants to continue selling in the arcade.  Because the arcade is located in the town center of Karam\u00fcrsel, it is busy every day.  She feels that she has the chance to socialize and to meet many people by working in the arcade, and for that reason she doesn\u2019t want to leave.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n\r\nMelahat Han\u0131m,evli ve 4 \u00e7ocu\u011fu var.

Kalygul has a secondary-specialized education. She is very responsible, personable and happy. At the present time, Kalygul and her husband are involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 9 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Kalygul's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 horse and 20 sheep, and also 3.34 hectares of land, where she primarily grows beans. They sell their harvest to wholesale distributors. Her husband provides significant support with the business.  The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Kalygul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows and sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Kalygul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a new

In this way, he has been able to provide for his family, who he loves very much, and even work alongside his wife who helps him run his business. He started with a small coffee bar and now has managed to expand by taking loans as a regular customer of KosInvest. His business is now open from early morning until very late night as he is quite popular and has many customers all day long. Primarily his customers are the younger generation who has a good time drinking coffee and getting together socially. <br \/><br \/>This time, Dragan is in need of a loan to purchase two more freezers, as well as tables, chairs, and some other materials for his cafe. He believes that these items are necessary to better meet the needs of his customers and thereby increase his business and profit even more.

The man shown in the photo is Razia\u2019s husband who is a driver by profession and provides transportation services using his three-wheeled rickshaw. He has been driving a rickshaw for many years to meet the family expenses. But now it requires proper maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. For this reason, Razia has applied for a loan of PKR 40,000, for her husband. He wants to buy new tires for his vehicle.

He hopes that the loan that he is asking for from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l. to buy new construction tools and supplies will help him increase his income by 15%.

He wants to purchase painting supplies such as oils and canvas, and framing supplies (including tools and wood)  to stretch his own canvases and craft his own frames.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFernando has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. This is his story:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I've drawn and painted since childhood and I haven't found a better way to express myself than through my art. I'm concerned with the dignity of Peruvian identity and the equity that by natural law is deserved in honor of peace and happiness. Cuzco is the root of my essential motivation.

and active women, and she has four children.  She married very early, and therefore could not continue her education after finishing secondary school.  Thus, she does not have a higher education.  Because Malohat and her family live in a rural area, she could only find work in agriculture, and she has been working for 10 years in this field.  Not long ago she began working with Arvand, the first time receiving a loan for consumer needs.  Because her house has fallen into a state of disrepair, Malohat now hopes to make repairs to her house.  The money she has saved from her salary is not enough to pay for the repairs, so she needs additional sources of funds.  For this reason, she turned once again to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to purchase building materials to repair her home.  Malohat thanks Arvand in advance for its support. \r\n

","en":"Bibihadas is 43 years old.  She is a hardworking and cheerful woman.  Her husband passed away in 1996, so Bibihadas is raising her 19-year old daughter alone.  She needed money after the death of her husband, and so started her own beekeeping business.  Her brothers helped her organize her business and to this day help her run the business.  Bibhadas receives additional income from growing potatoes and walnuts.  She is a very hardworking woman and works hard all year long - there is the planting, the harvest, and then the sales season after the harvest - all of which require tremendous energy from her.  She lives in an old house, and is thus building a new one.  Bibhadas needs to build a roof, but she doesn't have enough money to purchase slate.  She is asking for a loan of 5000 TJS to purchase slate.
