He is the father of a fifteen-year-old boy. He works in agriculture because he has worked in this trade since he was little. Estanislao does not have a formal education. During his youth, obtaining access to educational services was too complex because he lived in a rural area, and it was far away from the town where the national school was situated. Estanislao lives with his wife. She manages the household, and she's a part of the community's communal bank. Their son is completing his basic education at a school within the community. \r\n\r\nEstanislao has worked in agriculture since he was thirty-six years old, particularly in the cultivation of staple grains. His son helps him during the morning since he studies during the evening. Estanislao's parents, who dedicated their entire lives to agriculture, taught him the trade. He works from 6:00 a.m. until 12:00 noon. In addition, he raises pigs and looks after some cattle that he owns. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is applying for is to buy a pregnant cow. In this manner, he will improve his family's quality of life through dairy production that he will use to feed his family and also sell as an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nEstanislao's future plans are to have more livestock, increase his grain production, and support his son's academic development, considering that his son's dream is to be an agricultural engineer. With the help of future loans, he will carry out more projects that will improve his family's quality of

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, and borders onto Lake Victoria, the second-largest lake in the world. Populations are densely close to the lake, where many individuals make their living from fishing, and a few work in the small but slowly growing tourism industry. A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nSamwuel is married and has seven children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for sixteen years and they are currently growing beans, maize, millet, cowpeas and sunflowers on their farm. Samwuel is excited about beekeeping because it will earn him more income and also provide him with honey for food.\r\n\r\nThis is Samwuel\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He intends to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children. Samwuel\u2019s hope for the future is to expand his beekeeping project and produce more honey."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7.02,"image":{"id":1507612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Sindo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2014-01-22T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T21:10:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samwuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":17100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":17100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7.02,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":602.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467936169}],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T23:54:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca White","image":null}},{"id":660390,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":167.06,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase more palm oil, beans, and gari to expand her business.

It was difficult for her to continue her studies because she lived very far from the Instituto Nacional and, due to the economic situation that confronted her family in those days. With the passage of time, she has been learning domestic tasks, to which she is currently dedicated. At the age of 18, she decided to become attached to her life companion, who is presently working in the United States, striving to offer the best for his family. They are now the parents of a two-year-old boy.\r\n\r\nNubia works with an aunt, helping in sales in a small cafe in the Centro Escolar, where they sell Salvadoran snacks, pastries, and other fast foods. She now has 5 years experience in this type of activity, having grown with her aunt, who has taught her the work of a coffee shop. In addition to the earnings she receives from working in the shop, she also receives remittances from her husband in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe loan Nubia is requesting through CREDICAMPO is for purchasing products of primary necessity, since she plans to open her own store. Nubia hopes to benefit from establishing the first store in the neighborhood where she lives. Now she can count on the necessary experience to administer a store of this type, and this could offer a better quality of life for her son.\r\n\r\nNubia's future plans include paying off the loan and acquiring another loan in order to expand and better stock her store and provide better service to her customers. And, also, to help her son with his schooling, until he is able to complete his university

","en":"Alba, third from the left wearing a black and white blouse, is a member of the \u201cLa Minga de Chilo\u00e9\u201d communal bank, where most of its members are artists and sell new and used clothing.  Alba has a business where she makes and sells liquor, jams, and jellies.  She learned to make these things from her mother a long time ago.  Her life was not easy since she had to face many problems with her husband who didn\u2019t treat her well when they were together.  It\u2019s for this reason that she stayed with her children, which was difficult for her because she had to take care of the children herself.  She had to get them ahead herself, knocking on doors and looking for different ways to earn money.  Nobody wanted to help her; nobody trusted in her perseverance and responsibility, but life gave her a small opportunity and she began by selling 10 bottles of liquor.  Now she has a small family business and the challenge of setting up an area for producing her delicacies.  She will use the money to buy supplies such as bottles, fruit, sugar, labels, and alcohol.

Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, ground nuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes.

Because animal husbandry is one of the primary types of work among the village residents, he has a lot of experience taking care of livestock.  Olimjon is currently 46 years old, married and has four children.  His family, like many others, is involved in breeding cattle and producing milk.  His oldest son went to Kazakhstan to find work.  The rest of the children help Olimjon. To provide for his family and future for his gransons, Olimjon has to expand his business and, with the onset of cold weather, stock up on feed for the winter.

Currently he sells candied fruit door-to-door. He started his business six years ago out of the necessity to generate income to cover his and his wife's expenses.  His two children live on their own with their new families.  \r\n\r\nHe works every day throughout the streets of the city, and his determination and effort push him to always look for new ways to continue to advance. This is why he is requesting the support of this loan with which he would like to buy raw materials at wholesale (fruit, sugar, packaging, wooden sticks, etc.). This will allow him to stock up so he can meet the increased demand of the holiday season, especially the large influx of residents and foreigners who come to the city to see the Christmas shows at this time of year. In this way he will be able to increase the income he takes home. \r\n\r\nGuillermo states that his age does prevent him from working, much less dream.

This will enable him to improve the business image and, in addition, have sufficient supplies to meet demand, which increases significantly, at the end of the year, resulting in a higher level of income for the family.\r\n\r\nKevin, with his entrepreneurial spirit, and his future focus, wants to continue working on the credentials and strengthening of his business, in order that it may become more profitable, allowing him to continue to support his family with household expenses, as well as providing a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1496939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials and wholesale stock (e.g. cane, cups, disposable straws) and a plastic cover on which to put the motor and plastic containers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-23T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-21T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kevin Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71396},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":73372},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75403},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77490},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79635},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81839},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":86433},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91284},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":93811},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":96407}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.47,"local_amount":73270,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-22T09:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":74779.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450585736},{"amount":77.12,"local_amount":146901,"processed_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T08:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":149926.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459523862},{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":79180,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":80811,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227529},{"amount":42.92,"local_amount":81752,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245166},{"amount":42.52,"local_amount":80994,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":82662.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490855909},{"amount":282.4,"local_amount":537903,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":548983.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282643}],"funded_date":"2014-01-20T15:22:57Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T14:04:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alan Jones","image":1359870}},{"id":660554,"name":"Basilisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Basilisa is a hard-working entrepreneur who has a general store business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 15,000 through Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc.

I saved until I had enough to start my own workshop, and now I'm able to offer employment to other carvers from my village. Balinese culture and tradition inspire my artwork. As the son of a master carver, it is easy and enjoyable for me to transfer my imagination into my work. Through my art I do hope to provide a good life and a better future for my family, especially for my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am now sick and need additional artisans to help me create the sculptures. I have many unfinished statues but, because I am sick, only my wife is helping me and we are running out of stock. It is taking a long time to carve the sculptures, especially because, besides preparing and doing finishing on our designs, now my wife also has to take care of me. I am requesting a loan to help me hire people to do the finishing of my sculptures.

In the Andes, I came into contact with the culture of my ancestors, the Inca. Then I visited the Amazon rainforest.

I tell them that the only way to create is first to dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you so very much for encouraging me to try new designs - I feel proud of what I am achieving and it's all thanks to you.

is 30 years of age.

As the family\u2019s needs are increasing, every day they work hard to ensure that they will have an excellent harvest and can generate a higher income.\n\nSince Sophal doesn't have a safe latrine for use at home, she is unable to help her family members improve their sanitation and personal hygiene.

is 24 years old and married. To make a living, she has been growing cassava for six years. She earns about 27,000 KHR per day to support her family.\r\n\r\nSreyneang is a third cycle client with VisionFund.

He completed the sixth grade. The reason why he didn't continue his education is because his family was going through a serious financial crisis during that time. This was also the reason why he choose to work in agriculture and animal husbandry with his father, who dedicated his entire life to these activities. He steadily gained experience and started to take care of himself over time in such a way that he felt it was necessary to start his own home. That was where he met the woman who is now is wife; she manages the household. Isabel is the father of five children; his two oldest children are now independent and have their own homes.\r\n\r\nIsabel works in agriculture and animal husbandry. He also offers services with his chaff cutter; people hire him to process crop residues, such as corn, sugarcane, and straw, into animal feed. He learned this trade from his father who worked in the same way. Currently, he offers this service because of the earnings and the support that his children give him since it's a good source of income to support his family.\r\n\r\nThe loan that is he applying for is to buy a new chaff cutter; the one that he currently has is in poor condition due to the wear caused by its frequent use. In addition, another portion of the loan will be used to provide preventive and corrective maintenance for the motor. In this manner, he will be able to provide a better service to those who hire him.\r\n\r\nIsabel's future goals are to acquire machinery to make concentrated animal feed and support his youngest three children until they could graduate from college.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1515539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a new chaff cutter.

Since then I have wanted to help people and constantly feel that I am making a difference for them. \r\n\r\nThe other great influence in my life is my high school history teacher. She taught me a lot about the Kyrgyz people and their culture, which helped me to understand my community work in a different way. She also taught us about the history of our land and the relationship of the people with the land. This is why I want to study law, because law is an extension of those rules that come from the people and the land where they live. \r\n\r\nAUCA is the best university, where I can get a top notch education and where I will be able to gain all the necessary knowledge and skills and put them into practice.

AUCA is a great place for me to learn, because it has all of the latest technology, so students can decide if they want to be very modern, or if they want to use more classic technology like film. There are also great professors that have a lot of practical experience, and work in the field. <br \/><br \/>One of the difficulties in achieving my goals is that my family cannot afford to send me to AUCA.
