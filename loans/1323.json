It has one of the highest rural population densities in the world (in some areas, close to 600 people per square kilometer), which may contribute to the region's high poverty rates.\r\n\r\nDennis is married and has three children. His wife is a business woman and he farms. They have farmed for five years and currently grow bananas, maize, beans and vegetables. Dennis is looking forward to beekeeping as it is easy to manage and does not require much of his time.\r\n\r\nThis is Dennis\u2019 first loan with Honey Care. He plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to buy more beehives. Dennis\u2019 hope for the future is to have his children graduate from university so that they can get good jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1496229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.283333 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T10:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T10:40:11Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dennis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-28T20:05:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":649819,"name":"Lesly Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lesly es una joven de 28 a\u00f1os de edad quien es ama de casa y agricultora, madre de 3 hijos el primero cursa la primaria, el segundo en educaci\u00f3n preescolar y el ultimo reci\u00e9n nacido.

She has a high school education and she raises livestock as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, Tajikhan now has one dairy cow and a 1.5 hectare plot of land on which she grows rice, corn and cotton.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Tajikhan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy bulls to fatten up and sell on for a profit at the local market.  She plans to use the income from this to further increase her head of livestock, and she intends to prepare items for her daughters' dowries."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1499205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy steers for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kydyrsha village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tajikhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4370},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4476},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4584},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4695},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4808},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4924},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5043},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5165},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5290},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5418},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5549},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5678}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":179.12,"local_amount":8846,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8874.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.49,"payment_id":459019765},{"amount":92.93,"local_amount":4584,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4598.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":467831090},{"amount":95.85,"local_amount":4695,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4710.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053521},{"amount":98.17,"local_amount":4808,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4823.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749685},{"amount":100.53,"local_amount":4924,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4939.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178406},{"amount":102.96,"local_amount":5043,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5059.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463009},{"amount":105.45,"local_amount":5165,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5181.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947036},{"amount":106.49,"local_amount":5290,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5306.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.51,"payment_id":542440371},{"amount":103.81,"local_amount":5418,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5435.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.81,"payment_id":561578186},{"amount":106.3,"local_amount":5549,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5566.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.99,"payment_id":579488774},{"amount":104.62,"local_amount":5678,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5696.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.31,"payment_id":595435956}],"funded_date":"2014-02-13T04:53:53Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":650304,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis lives in kakamega.

Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Jypargul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy pepper seeds, fertilizer and pesticides to for her agricultural work.

lives in Kidzumbani, a small town in Kwale County. Kwale county is located on the Kenyan coast, near Tanzania. Inconsistent rains, especially recently, have made farming difficult, and the poverty rates in the county are above the Kenyan average. Beekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passion fruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies. Many farmers in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives, and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.\r\n\r\nAllan is married but has no children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They currently have a tree plantation on their farm, as well as dairy cows such as the one pictured with him above. Allan is looking forward to beekeeping as it is a good source of income that requires little input. \r\n\r\nThis is Allan\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. He is interested in working with Honey Care as they offer very good training. Allan intends to use the proceeds from his beehives to build a poultry house. Allan\u2019s hope for the future is to expand his beekeeping project.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1496096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kwale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T12:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T12:00:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Allan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-24T15:14:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Moody","image":null}},{"id":660746,"name":"Thy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thy is a 56-year-old woman from a small village of Bakan district, Pursat province.

He is a very decent man.  He loves nature and animals.  Starting in his early childhood, he helped his parents raise cattle.  Over time, he became more and more interested in cattle.  When he grew up, Gaffur firmly decided to go into the cattle business, i.e. buying and selling cattle.  Today, Gaffur's business is going well and is developing slowly but surely.\r\n\r\nGaffur would like to buy several more goats and sheep, which he will fatten over the winter and sell for a better price in the spring.  However, Gaffur doesn't have the financial means to buy the cattle, so he has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.  He is very thankful to MDO Arvand for its cooperation and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1493381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is 46 years old and has two children.  She is a widow, her husband having died several years ago.  Now Zuhrojon alone raises her children who are still young and go to school.  Zuhrojon is a hardworking woman and loves her children deeply.  For their sake she works nights.  Zuhrojon used to work in farming, and sometimes cleaned houses.  Later she decided to go into the sales business at the market, so she rented a stall and started selling vegetables.  Her business took off smoothly.   She has previously taken out a loan from MDO Arvand for business development.\r\n\r\nBit by bit Zuhrojon has saved up money for home repairs, but her savings aren't enough.  So, she has again applied to MDO Arvand for a loan so that she can finish her home repairs before the first snows.  She plans to use the loan to buy building materials.  MDO Arvand's clients come to them with their hopes and dreams and Zuhrojon is very glad that they are given

","en":"Shahnoza is a young woman at about 30 years old.  She is married and the mother of three charming children.  Shahnoza's husband moved to Russia to work as a laborer.   No matter how hard it is for him to work far away in foreign lands, he works patiently for the good of his family.  Shahnoza also doesn't just sit around.  She also invests her efforts into the family budget.   Shahnoza is in the sales business.  She sells candies and various sweets at the market.  She has more than six years of experience in this field.  She started her business in a tiny stall and as time has gone by, she has expanded her stall and has widened her inventory.\r\n\r\nAs usual with the beginning of the New Year holidays, goods sell quickly.  In order to increase her turnover, Shahnoza has again applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.  She would like to express her gratefulness for their partnership and support.

She says \u201cMy introduction to the organization has taught me more than what I am and I am glad about it.\u201d Her husband and she work hand in hand to support the family.  She lives with her two kids and her in-laws on rent in a village which is about 35 kms from the main town of Imphal.\r\n\r\nHoineo sells vegetables in the town market and makes an income for the family.  She usually gets the vegetable supplies from other vegetable sellers and resells them.  She carries vegetable items in a basket and walks every day to the main town to sell. Sometimes, she goes to the capital market and sells the vegetables. The profit would have been more if she could manage her own farm and sell those vegetables. The meager income is not sufficient to manage their daily expenses as well as to provide good education for the kids.  She also needs to pay rent and take care of her aged in-laws who need utmost care at their age.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Hoineo will purchase vegetables like mustard greens, cabbages, peas, coriander leaves, and other local vegetables in stock and sell them. She is hopeful that with the additional income, the family will celebrate Christmas with joy. There were incidents where she and her husband could not afford to buy their kids anything for Christmas since they were short of money.\r\n\r\nHoineo always wanted to have her own house and also start her own vegetable farm.

She is married and a mother many times over; she and her husband have seven children.  Her husband works as a trolleybus driver, four of her daughters are married and live separately, two of her daughters are in college and her youngest son is still in school.  Burulbubu has a high school education and raises livestock as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business 22 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 700 som KGS.  Her family is large, close-knit and hard-working.  Thanks to Burulbubu's dedicated work, their farm now has three dairy cows, two sheep and two goats.  Her monthly income is 2,800 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Burulbubu has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy sheep to increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use this income to further increase her head of livestock and to save up money to build a new

Like many others, her family is in the business of raising cattle and producing milk.  Her husband is in the transportation business.   All Saodat's children help her with the business, which she has been in for almost 20 years.  Before that, she helped her parents raise cattle.  She was born and raised in a rural area.  Since animal husbandry is one of the main types of work in her village, Saodat has a great deal of experience in raising cattle.\r\n\r\nSaodat's goal is to provide her children with an education.  The family needs to expand their business, and with the onset of winter, they have to store up feed.  Several of Saodat's acquaintances recommended that she apply to MDO Arvand for a loan. Saodat and her family decided to take out a loan from MDO Arvand and plan to use it to buy a large quantity of cattle feed.  She would like to thank MDO Arvand in advance for its financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1493055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"adrasmon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T13:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T13:00:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saodat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":76.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":81.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":97.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.1,"local_amount":73.1,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":73.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449673615},{"amount":74.77,"local_amount":74.77,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":74.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144411},{"amount":76.49,"local_amount":76.49,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":76.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960228},{"amount":78.24,"local_amount":78.24,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":78.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180988},{"amount":80.03,"local_amount":80.03,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":80.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875583},{"amount":81.86,"local_amount":81.86,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":81.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302810},{"amount":83.74,"local_amount":83.74,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585611},{"amount":85.65,"local_amount":85.65,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":85.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081190},{"amount":87.62,"local_amount":87.62,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":87.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562071},{"amount":89.62,"local_amount":89.62,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":89.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694756},{"amount":188.88,"local_amount":188.88,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":188.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626559}],"funded_date":"2013-12-28T21:18:22Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":650335,"name":"Amos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amos is a married man with four children.

Doner (kebab\/sandwich\/gyro) has become a very popular fast food dish in the last several years in Georgia. According to Sanan\u2019s estimation, sales will be high. \r\n\r\nSanan is requesting a loan to buy all the needed equipment such as a doner machine, oven, etc. He will also buy raw materials for making food. The income from the caf\u00e9 will be a great support for the family as it will generate additional income. Sanan appreciates your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1498517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start up a food cafe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Marneuli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":138.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":148.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":145.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":152.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":157.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":159.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":163.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":168.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":171.65},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":176.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":179.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":184.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":190.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":193.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":198.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":202.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.48},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":650351,"name":"Wilfred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilfred lives in a small town close to Kitale.

good family man and he has four children.  He and his family live in the village of Adrasmon.  Orif raises sheep which he fattens and sells.  He has been in this business for 25 years and he works very hard at raising cattle because he doesn't want his family to feel any financial limitations, even though they don't have enough money.  Orif keeps his cattle at his home.  He fattens them up and when they are ready for sale, he sells their meat to local butchers.  People use lamb to prepare traditional dishes.\r\n\r\nThis will be Orif's second loan to buy cattle.  He plans to sell a large quantity of meat in the winter.

Beekeeping is relatively new to the area but many farmers are very interested in owning hives. \r\n\r\nPeter is married and has no children. He and his wife have been farming for fifteen years and are currently growing sweet potatoes and raising livestock on their land.

All the members of the family help Oygul with her daily farm tasks and her husband sells their produce at the local market.  Oygyl and her family put their cows out to pasture in another field for the summer and sell them on at a profit in the fall.  This coming winter, she thinks it will be necessary to get another pair of cows and to make a winter's supply of food for their livestock.

She is the featured borrower member for Lily Lom and she is pictured with her hand raised.\r\n\r\nThe group is comprised of five hard-working women who all reside in a village which is about 15 kms from the town. The town is 62 kms from the capital town of Imphal. The group usually contributes an equal share and they took the land from the village chief on rent for a period of one year, so that they can cut down firewood and burn it to make charcoal. When the charcoal is ready to be sold, Hoikhonei walks every day at the break of the dawn to collect the charcoal from the charcoal-firing sites, carries the charcoal sack on her back, and walks to the village. Only occasionally does a vehicle ply that route; if one gets lucky, then one gets a ride. Otherwise, walking is the only option. From the village, Hoikhonei travels to the town market with the charcoal and sells it.\r\n\t\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Hoikhonei will contribute her share for taking the land on rent and start burning charcoal. She is sure to earn a good amount of money since charcoal is in great demand during winter season and the price is high unlike in off seasons. She says, she will also be able to pay new admissions for the kids without worrying where to get the money as she can sell her charcoal like hot cakes in this season. She thanks Kiva and says, do continue your co-operation with WSDS and make our life a happier one.  She is glad for the support and believes that this may bring success in life. She says, \u201cThank you, Kiva!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in the charcoal business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1498514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To take a portion of land on rent, cut wood, and burn charcoal for selling to support the family and kids' education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoinem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingkhochin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-24T19:37:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":660751,"name":"Lilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"To make a living, Lilia operates a retail store and grows vegetables in her garden.

Due to the family\u2019s financial constraints, Aun is experiencing difficulties in paying her son\u2019s education fees, so she is requesting a loan of USD250 to add to her existing money in order to pay for his enrollment fees. \r\n\r\nAun is very happy and thankful for the loans available via  programs like Kiva that allow poor students to pursue higher education, and contribute to the future development of Cambodia.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1513046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to pay for her son's enrollment fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Svay Rieng","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2014-01-23T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595175858}],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T16:27:39Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:11:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":660780,"name":"Maria Luna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria Luna is 42 years old, married, and has nine children.

He is married and has six children who are 38, 31, 27, 25, 22 and 20 years old.  He has two additional dependents who live with him as his sales assistants.  In 1970, Kafo established his used clothing business. He began his business just to generate funds to settle his domestic bills. His business is located at the city centre and his main customers are all classes of customers. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 500,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of Le 3,000,000. Kaffo has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan in order to buy bundles of used clothing for Le 3,000,000. He hopes that this loan will increase his stock level and his profit. In the future, Kaffo plans to complete the construction of his house and to educate his children.

She sells them for meat to the local butcher shops when they grow. It takes eight to nine months for her to raise and sell them. She goes out in the morning to leave the goats for grazing in the fields and returns by noon. Then she cooks for her family.  She resumes taking care of her goats by feeding them at home. Her husband assists her in selling and maintaining these goats. In this way she is earning to improve her cash flow, which is not sufficient to manage her daily activities.\r\n\t\r\nShe wants to enlarge her business, so she wants to purchase 10 more goats. In this way she can earn a good amount after all expenditures in her business. \r\n\r\nShe and her group members have requested a loan of 120,000 INR for her group so that they can all earn more and improve their families' cash flow.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1498430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ten more goats and their fodder and vaccine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Balugaon, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T15:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T15:40:17Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bangali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhanu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abhagini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T17:43:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":650437,"name":"Neome","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neome is 33 years old and lives in Long Town with her husband and three children, who are between the ages of 7 months and 15 years old; two are in school. \r\n\r\nShe runs a shop where she sells stout, beer, soft drinks, mineral water and many others beverages.

Weremisha has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWeremisha is 55 years old and has been a farmer for 30. Weremisha works as a farmer to provide for his 14 children. The community and other farmers know Weremisha as friendly and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community, such as with the men's group and prayer group. Weremisha described his harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nHe first joined One Acre Fund in 2013 and will continue working with One Acre Fund in order to get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed his family. As an active member in his community, Weremisha also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Weremisha plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school.  \r\n\r\nWeremisha and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1489412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T15:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T15:40:17Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Weremisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":331638,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331638}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3850,"local_amount":331638,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":333794.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722867}],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T17:52:31Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":650279,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter lives in Mwachande, a small town in Kwale County.

Unfortunately the school was too far from his home, about 3 kilometres, which made it difficult for his mother to walk there twice a day with him. Today Santos is married. His wife takes care of the house. They have four children aged 23, 22, 18 and 12. Two of them study and the other two have finished their basic education.\r\n\r\nSince he was 15 years old Santos has been working as day labor on coffee plantations. He does work like cleaning, pruning, digging holes, spreading fertilizer and harvesting. His father taught him how to saw wood when he was 20. Today Santos is a wood sawyer and cultivates 14,000 square meters of land producing corn and beans. He has the help of his children doing this so that in his house they don't lack food.  The fields where they work are about one kilometre from their house and they walk there every day, working from 6 am until noon.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy agricultural inputs to grow a companion crop of 14,000 square metres of corn and beans. This will help Santos continue to do what he likes best, which is to make the earth produce. This will ensure that his family can eat.\r\n\r\nSantos has a dream of owning land to grow on, so as not to be uncertain each year if the land they grow on will be for rent. So each year together with his children, they do what is possible to achieve this dream. Also he would like to make improvements on the house they live in, it needs a lot of TLC. He also wants to help his children so that they continue studying and manage to finish their High School studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1516207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs to grow 14,000 square meters of corn and beans as companion crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-23T15:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T15:50:05Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Ernesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420860}],"funded_date":"2014-01-28T15:38:58Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":660792,"name":"Mzia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mzia is a 57-year-old widow, from Kaspi district.

He is pictured here in a group of 9 One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 98 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. George has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\n\nGeorge is a reliable member of the community. He is married with four children. George is 39 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 19 years to support his family. In addition to this, George is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. He described his harvest last year as \"good\". He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages. \n\nGeorge first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. George joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, purchase fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. George plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. George\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.   \n\nGeorge and his group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6075,"image":{"id":1487033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T16:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T16:00:15Z","loan_amount":6075,"lender_count":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathayo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":524202,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":6075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":524202}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":6075,"local_amount":524202,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":525912.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722860}],"funded_date":"2014-01-20T22:12:51Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:33:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Kossick","image":1845905}},{"id":650436,"name":"Alexander S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alexander is 36 years old and lives in the Kakata area.

The group resides in a village that is about 40 kms from Imphal town.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the loans, she started off her business by selling meat in the market, but she gradually changed her business into selling rice. She did that because meat cannot be stored for days, which used to be a huge loss for business. She sells imported and local rice in the town market and sometimes she takes rice to the neighbouring villages and sells it. She also takes orders for rice and accordingly arranges it and makes an income from customers. Rice is a staple food for the state and it is not difficult to sell it. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase rice from farmers and store it. Harvesting season has just ended and it is the right time to buy rice as the rate is low compared to other seasons. The profit will be more and she will have more chances to earn money in the future when the price of rice is high. She thanks Kiva for the support and for giving her financial support when she really needed it. She will always remain grateful for the work that Kiva has done.

With the startup credit, Nato will set up a fast food caf\u00e9. She will purchase all the needed inventory to begin business. She will sell sandwiches, pies, and fizzy drinks. Nato hopes her business will be profitable and that she will attract many customers since there is no similar caf\u00e9 nearby. The profit will be reinvested in the same business and Nato will be able to improve the living conditions of her

He is from the Shahrituz region. Shahrituz is a rural region of Tajikistan that has preseverd its 1000-year old culture and customs.  Bobonazar is a local who respects the culture and traditions of his people. You can see this by the way he is dressed. He is wearing a \u201cjoma\u201d (a traditional men\u2019s robe made of pressed cotton). In villages and hamlets  around Tajikistan, people still wear \u201cjoma\u201d. It protects both from the cold and, in warm weather from the heat.\r\n\r\nBobonazar, like the generations before him, is a farmer. He has learned this work from his father. Bobonazar grows produce. But at present he would like also to raise livestock. This will allow him to earn a bigger income and he will be able to spend the winter usefully.  His funds are insufficient to buy livestock, which is why he is turning to you for help. Please help him!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1514454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy cattle and launch his livestock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-01-23T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bobonazar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":276}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.38,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":278.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490883041},{"amount":58.38,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":278.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504310083},{"amount":58.38,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":278.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517591890},{"amount":58.38,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":278.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530087530},{"amount":58.38,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":278.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542568699},{"amount":58.38,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":278.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561700703},{"amount":58.38,"local_amount":278,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":278.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579637341},{"amount":114.2,"local_amount":554,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":555.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.14,"payment_id":595213975}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T14:23:37Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T14:23:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":660805,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita earns a living as a dressmaker.

She lives with her husband and five children in a rural area located in the district of Moung Russey, Cambodia. She is a rice farmer who has been growing rice for ten years. To increase the family's income, her husband works for others for a fee and raises pigs.

He lives with his wife and school-aged son. Gocha's wife is a cook at a private dining-room and monthly generates 350 GEL. Gocha is involved in agricultural activity. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing citrus and vegetables. He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\nAs he has only seasonal income, Gocha decided to start a taxi business and seek credit among local financial institutions. The start-up program, that is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

man. He is a kind and loving father. He is 46 years old. He is married and has five children. For around 15 years already, he has been involved in construction. He works as a foreman and gets a good salary. And when he does not have big orders, Inom still earns money. He has his own small store, where he sells groceries. Also, one of his sons is working in Russia and sends home a certain sum of money. All the income is enough for Inom to provide his family with all the necessities. <br \/><br \/>But now Inom wants to make good repairs on his home, since the home has come to a state of disrepair. But he does not have all the needed sums for repairs. Therefore, Inom turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to buy building materials for home repairs. He very much hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1492148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T17:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T17:00:14Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":428},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":439.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":452.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":464.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":477.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":491.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":505.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":519.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.81},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":548.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":564.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":574.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.43},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":184.45,"local_amount":867.98,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":880.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144414},{"amount":96.11,"local_amount":452.3,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":458.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960231},{"amount":98.81,"local_amount":464.97,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":471.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479180991},{"amount":101.57,"local_amount":477.99,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":484.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875586},{"amount":104.41,"local_amount":491.37,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":498.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302813},{"amount":107.34,"local_amount":505.13,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":512.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585614},{"amount":582.31,"local_amount":2740.26,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2779.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081193}],"funded_date":"2014-02-22T00:41:11Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":660829,"name":"Ravdanbazar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr.Ravdanbazar is 55 years old lives with his wife in Ger, in a traditional nomadic yurt in Zavhan province, Mongolia.

His mother gets assistance from the local government, and other family members are involved in agricultural activity. Aslan works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize and nuts. The family also has milk cows and 3 cattle and always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. As the existing income is not enough for 9 family members and Aslan can\u2019t find a state job, he decided to start his own business. He owns a car and decided to start a taxi business. With the requested loan of 1500 GEL, he will install gas equipment and serve locals as a taxi driver. Aslan will take care of his family's increased needs and is thankful to Kiva lenders for giving him a chance to generate income.

He has four children between the ages of 4 and 12. He describes himself to be confident. He operates a retail business where he sells sugar, milk, bread, washing soap, and other items. He has been involved in this business for three years. His business is located in a conducive environment, and his primary customers are small-scale customers. He describes his biggest business challenge to be a lack of funds. He will use the 50,000 KES loan to add inventory of milk, bread, washing soap, and other items.

five children. She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 1,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now has five milk cows, one horse and 14 sheep, with a monthly income of 15,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Jumakan has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows for fattening and resale at the market for a high price. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing her quantity of

He says that one day he got together with some friends and told them about his situation; one of them was a mason who told him that he would give him a job as a mason's assistant. This is how he began in the field. Afterwards, he learned how to be bricklayer. Before this, he used to work in agriculture. At times, his masonry jobs are located near his house, but other times he has to travel by foot or bus for up to an hour. In order to get to work early, he gets up at 4:30 a.m. so he can leave his house at 5:30 a.m. He works a ten-hour day and returns home at 5:00 p.m. This is his daily routine. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy a table with four chairs, a pot for boiling tamales, a large griddle, and ingredients for making pupusas. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to see his children graduate from college since he didn't have that opportunity.

He is 59 years old, and is the owner of a stationery store that he started up 4 years ago, taking advantage of a location in front of an educational institution where there was no nearby competition.  He works every day, and offers all kinds of stationery items for sale.  He also provides photocopy, fax, and scanning services, and sells ladies' accessories.  In this way, he generates the resources he needs to cover the basic expenses for his family.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Ramon needs a loan to stock up his store with wholesale purchases of notebooks, pens, markers, crayons, rulers, and other items.  This way he will be sufficiently stocked up with merchandise to meet the demand that increases during the first months of the year when the school year begins, which  he hopes will enable him to increase his income.\r\n\r\nRamon has a goal to expand his store so that he can offer a much greater variety of items for sale.

She lives in Logan Town, one of the early communities in Liberia that is well-known. She is married and her husband is a government worker. They both have four children, between the ages of 12 to 19. All four of them are presently in school and live at home. \r\n\r\nMakansa stopped her education at grade four. For the past three years, she has been running a shop where she sells cement. She started in business by selling rubber dishes and later received money from her husband to increase her inventory. She learned this way of selling from her brother.
