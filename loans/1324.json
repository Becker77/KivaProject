She is in the service industry. She works selling fast food. She started the business a few years ago selling sandwiches, with the goal of becoming independent. Later, little by little her clients' demands grew, so she decided to rent a space. Her goal is to sell a different type of food that is well-known in the city. She asks for this loan so she can purchase a kitchen fryer to fulfill her customers' orders and offer different foods. She thinks that the loan will be very helpful since it will increase her sales and increase her profits. Her plan for the future is to have her own property.

She started four years ago on her own initiative. The business is quite profitable, since she fattens up the pigs and even butchers them to obtain income for her family and her son. She also sells tamales and atol [a traditional sweet drink] in the evenings in her community, with the help of her sister and her mother. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy 6 pigs valued at $50 each, and she also needs $100 to buy school supplies for her son and uniforms which he will wear at school. She will invest the rest in buying supplies, such as corn, concentrated animal feed and other items to maintain her pigs. She currently has two piglets; she recently sold two pigs in the community.\r\n\r\nWith this she will ensure that her son can go to the local school, and she will also have her piglets to fatten up, which she will take care of and later sell for a better price and obtain higher returns. \r\n\r\nAna will build a house of her own for her son, where she can continue working independently to give her son a better future. \r\n\r\nWith her small savings, she plans to create a larger enclosure where she can raise and fatten up her pigs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1516240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 6 pigs and animal feed, as well as school supplies and uniforms for her son.

Sadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, he was unable to study a professional career. Malkhaz works hard on the family-owned agricultural land, growing nuts and looking after 4 cows, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. They also use the milk products to feed the family. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only a seasonal income, Malkhaz decided to start a firewood business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, that is the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting a businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 1,300 GEL for purchasing bulls and starting a firewood business. Malkhaz will bring firewood from the forest and serve local people. The new business initiative will give Malkhaz a chance to have financial stability and a monthly income.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1498657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"To

He completed 9th grade thanks to the opportunity to study that was given to him by his parents. He's single and doesn't have any children. He currently lives with his parents, and he helps them pay for household expenses.\r\n\r\nJoel grows 7,000 square meters of corn and beans. He has been in this line of work since he has 15 and he learned it from his father. His father has been a farmer all his life and he taught his son to work and above all to be responsible and honest. Besides, thanks to his father he learned to do farm work using animal traction, specifically oxen. They are his source of employment and his means of livelihood, and he needs to keep on renewing them, because they face a great deal of weariness each year from doing this type of work. That's in addition to his work on growing corn.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase farming supplies so that he can have the opportunity to continue working on his corn and bean crops. With the loan he'll purchase fertilizer, seeds, and pesticides to be used as a preventive measure for pest and disease control.\r\n\r\nJoel dreams of moving forward with his college education. For that purpose he needs to keep on working hard, as he has done so far. That way he'll be able to help his family improve their living conditions.

She is a businesswoman and has a clothing store.  She started in this line of work by working in her aunt's store and her father gave her some financial support that allowed her to start her own business.\r\n\r\nCurrently, her store is well stocked with many kinds of clothing.

old.  Currently, Luis and his family live in the house of Luis\u2019 mother alongside Luis\u2019 brothers.  The house only has 2 rooms, a kitchen and an outdoor latrine.  It is overcrowded. \n\nThey are inhabitants of the municipality of Urique in the northern state of Chihuahua in Mexico, famous because of the Copper Canyon.  The municipality has 2,300 inhabitants, some of whom are Tarahumara Indians, who still live their own culture and speak their own language.\n\nLuis and Juana want to use this loan to build their own home.  They see it as an opportunity they have to offer their children an inheritance - a home where they can feel comfortable, where they can move from the kitchen to the room with all the freedom their own house can give them, improving their quality of life.\n\nLuis Gabriel is a young father and is known as responsible and hard working.  He is a very respectful and sociable young man without vices and he has a very good sense of humor.  Luis Gabriel is a hotel employee and is also a waiter in a community 9km away, where Juana also works as a cook.  Juana is a committed mother and wife - hard working, with a very good temperament. \n\nAt the moment they are completely dedicated to their work.  Together they earn USD 307 a month, and with this money they pay for food, education, health, and clothing.  They also try to save money for the future - especially for housing because they want to own a home.  Luis Gabriel says that they saw a possibility with Habitat to make their dreams come true.  They have completed all the program requirements.  In addition, they are a very active and participative family in all the activities of the community. \n\nHabitat for Humanity is a nonprofit international organization founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe and affordable place to live.  Habitat for Humanity Mexico works in communities with groups who build through mutual help and a self-construction system.  The families need to participate in workshops and trainings about building, healthy housing, and financial education so they can develop and strengthen their capacities.  Habitat for Humanity has worked in Mexico since 1989 and has served more than 7,000 families just in the last 3 years."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":891.61,"image":{"id":1477352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to

He went to school through sixth grade. He is married, and his wife does the domestic work. Two of their four children go to school, and all four live with them.\r\n\r\nFrancis works as a security officer at a business in the city. He has had this work for four years. He began this work thanks to the guidance of a friend who took him to get the job. But he also works in agriculture. He has done this agricultural work since he was a boy. His father taught him, since the agricultural work would be useful to him in life. His wife helps him. In his security job he works in 24-hour shifts, so when he is off, he does agricultural work.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is applying for at Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to pay off some debts that he has with other people in the community, since two months ago he suffered an illness for which they decided to operate on him, and this was how he became sick. The loan will improve his situation, since with the institution he can make monthly payments but he can't with the individuals, and this will help him a lot because he has more time to pay.\r\n\r\nHis dreams for his future are to continue working in agriculture and thus always be able to sustain his family, since they won't lack for food, and with his earnings from his work as a security officer to be able to send his children to school and raise them.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1497781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

He has a workshop and he, with the help of his father and wife, produces cutlets, kebabs, pelmeni (a Russian national dish made of meat and dough) and khinkali (a Georgian national dish also made of meat and dough and with some spices). All these products Garik distributes to different food markets, supermarkets and he says that he also has orders from restaurants. The main product that he needs is meat that he buys from local butchers or he drives to nearby villages and brings the meat from there.\r\n\r\nGarik says that his business is thriving and his orders have increased, so he already wants to hire several workers and a cook, so he has asked a loan of 3000 US  dollars in order to enlarge his workshop so he work faster and more productively.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1499381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They have 3 girls: Mar\u00eda who is 7 years old, Claudia who is 5, and Juana, the youngest one, who is 3 years old.  They live in a two-room house made of wood with an earth floor in Pozo, which has 1262 inhabitants.  According to some statistics, it has 215 households and few speak Spanish well.  82% don't have any income. \n\nAntonio and Petrona want this loan to improve their life conditions, as they know the importance of having a safe place where they can improve their life situation.  Their aspirations are pretty much to have a safe place to live with their children, and to be able to give them an education which they themselves didn't have.\n This is a young couple and during the workshops and interviews, they can be identified as people with a lot of energy and enthusiasm to overcome.  According with the culture, they have grown their family, as they believe that with more children, they will have more workers and income, and consequently a better life.  \n\nMost of the community works in farming, as there aren't jobs, and they survive with the harvest.  There is little income and when it's not harvest season, the father must work elsewhere and leave the family for several months, often searching for jobs as a baker's assistant or farmhand.  Almost everyone in the community are coffee producers, however the prices they get are very low because of the \u201ccoyotes\u201d (who are the intermediaries, and market the coffee for the producers but in the end keep the majority of profits).\n\nHabitat for Humanity is a nonprofit international organization founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe, and affordable place to live.  Habitat for Humanity Mexico works in communities with groups who build through mutual help and a self-construction system.  The families need to participate in workshops and trainings about building, healthy housing, and financial education in order to develop and strengthen their capacities.  Habitat for Humanity has been working in Mexico since 1989 and has served more than 7,000 families just in the last 3 years.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":689.27,"image":{"id":1477381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to

She only completed one year of high school, which was not a difficulty for her, because she needed to help her family to get ahead.  Her husband died after suffering for 2 years from natural causes, leaving her with her only child.  It has been for him that she has struggled, so that she could provide for him and so that he could get an education.  \r\n\r\nAna lives alone with her son, who helps her with many things, from household tasks to working in the fields.  In spite of being a very small family, they try to work together so that they can get ahead.  \r\n\r\nAna has a business selling snacks such as cakes, fried cassava, banana tostadas, and her main product, which is bread filled with chicken.  She's had this business for 10 years, and she sells in the center of her town.  She started this business seeing a need to generate income so that she could give her son an education and cover the household expenses. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, she now has help from her son, who works in agriculture and as a day worker where he gets an income so that he can help his mother with the household expenses.  Ana sells all week with only 2 days of rest.  She walks from her house to the place where she has set up a stall, and her son helps her with the production of staple grains that she uses to make some of her snacks.  She sells from 2pm until 6pm.  \r\n\r\nAna is requesting a loan to buy the products that she needs to make her snacks, such as bananas, cassava, and the chicken she needs for her stuffed bread.

Aida has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Aida is involved in animal husbandry, having started 9 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aida's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 3 sheep. She is additionally involved in reselling vegetables.  She sells them at a wholesale market and resells to retail customers.  Aida is very diligent because her parents were involved in animal husbandry for a long time and they got Aida to love hard work and animals.  The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Aida requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Aida plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to open a small pavilion for selling

In 2009, Rohini and three members of her village formed a group and took a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their existing businesses. This is their third loan.\r\n  \r\nAt the time she took her first loan, her sales were not sufficient to meet her daily needs. Out of her small income, she is maintaining her family in a low profile. Now, she is very much confident in running her business and has developed her shop significantly. At present, her monthly income is about Rs 6,000. She wants to take another loan to purchase a big stock of ready-made items like shirts, trousers, under garments etc.  She has a dream of constructing a well and extending her house.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are named Damayanti, Subashini and Ananta. They want a loan for a fancy shop, a ready made shop and a fish business,

of Tursunzoda. He is 28 years old.  He has been working as a retailer for almost eight years, selling winter shoes at the local market.  He buys shoes in bulk quantities and resells on a retail basis.  His family helps him to run the business.  He works in any weather and any day of the week because in winter his merchandise is in high demand.

She does not have an education because of her difficult childhood. Her parents only taught her to work in agriculture and to take care of the home. She is a single mother of 3 children, who are all now adults with their own families. \r\n\r\nShe lives alone in a house that she has thanks to a community project, which also granted her a small plot of land. This is why she now has a house made of wattle and daub and sheet metal. \r\n\r\nNidian currently earns a living selling fruit and vegetables in her community. She sells in the municipal park. Her business is an informal one but it has brought her many benefits. She has been selling in the park for more than one year now. In the past, she worked washing clothes for some people in the community, and was paid according to the amount of clothes she washed. She works alone because her children already live in their own homes. She buys fruits and vegetables in the nearest town, which she travels to by city bus. It takes her 30 minutes to reach her destination. \r\n\r\nNidian is requesting a loan from Credicampo to invest $300 in fruits and vegetables to sell in her community because the town festival is approaching and sales will increase with the influx of people to the different events. She will also use $300 to purchase wood and sheet metal to make some renovations to her humble home. She will use the remaining funds to cover personal expenses because she is currently applying for a stall in the new community market that will open in a few months. The loan will help her to be prepared with equipment and merchandise to sell from her stall. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Nidian dreams of building her own house of adobe and, God willing, out of cement blocks.

And he decided to take on the opportunity.\r\n\r\nHerbert has applied for a loan of 1,000,000 Ugandan shillings to help him buy bulls for resale, and he will use the rest of the money to pay tuition for his children. He also wants to build a permanent house for his children. With the acquired income, Herbert has been able to pay school fees for his children; however, he has been facing the challenge of competition and price changes.

She loves to draw, listen to music, read and educate herself. She also likes to  play soccer and is very interested in the area of merchandising and publicity. <br \/><br \/>She works at night as a booster and sales promotor. She studies graphic design during the day. She was studying Industrial Design at the university, and had started her third semester, but due to finances she had to defer this career. Because of that, she decided to get a job so that she could save money to return to her studies at night and help her parents with the costs of her schooling in graphic design. Angie wants to finish both programs and achieve what she has set out to do, but her job barely allows her to help out her parents and pay for school. <br \/><br \/>She really needs the help of Kiva because money is always scarce in her parents home and for her, and although her parents used to pay for school they can no longer do so.

He is single and does not yet have the responsibility of children and a wife, so it could be said that nobody depends on him; he lives with his mother and siblings. For financial reasons he could not go to school past the sixth grade, after which time there came the need to look for a source of income to cover the family expenses. \r\n \r\n\r\nCurrently Fredy works as an assistant in a small hardware store, which is located 1.5 kilometers from where he lives. He already has more than two years of experience being an employee of this establishment, and he is in charge of making tiles, blocks, etc. He is also responsible for transporting the products they sell to the homes of their customers. It is his first job and he is very appreciative of the vote of confidence that he has been given to advance. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to buy a motorcycle. Fredy has seen the need for having a mode of transportation, in the first place for being able to transport himself from home to his place of work and vice versa, since occasionally he leaves very late from work and doesn't manage to catch the bus. He also says that it is important for him to have a mode of transportation in order to run any kind of errand for his family, and it would be easier to travel by motorcycle than bus because the first option is safer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dreams and plans of this client for the future are to make a home, have children, and have a job that allows him to cover all the necessities and obligations that this requires. He also aspires to be able to build his own house onto the house where his mother lives, in order to be more independent. This client is very aware of the importance and support that Credicampo offers with their loans, and he will make his best effort to always pay his fees on time. This way he can achieve the dreams to which he aspires. The loan will be a great help, to be mobile without any kind of inconvenience and to be able to get more done at his job from arriving earlier to complete his work obligations. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1516350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a motorcycle.

Elmira has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide an additional income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 9 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Elmira's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 14 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Elmira plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's continued education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1514915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

In order to further develop her business, Bubinazira requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls for fattening up.

It brings together 4 women who know one another through parentage and neighborly ties. They are 50 years old on average. Married with an average of six children, they run different businesses, such as buying and selling vegetables to make sauces and restaurants. They live in large traditional families in Keleya in the Bougouni prefecture (Sikasso prefecture, Republic of Mali). They have run small businesses for several years and are very sought after in their businesses. With the concern of satisfying the growing needs of their clientele, the members of the group decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso six years ago. They are on the fifth group loan.

One day she said that she was going to study that year and she  did her calculations of everything she spent at home. After doing the additions and subtractions, she realised that the children needed more things for school and so she decided not to study that year as she put her children's studies first. As the days went by she met people who spoke to her about the classes and how there were payment facilities. \r\n\r\nThis year she saw her opportunity and decided to study a course. In the future she would like to work in hospitals, because 2 years ago she worked in filing next to the emergency department of a hospital. There she saw that in healthcare there is a need for people who have a good way with others, who are unassuming and prepared to give a helping hand, since these are the occasions when people need help from others. It is important to look deep inside ourselves and realise that they are ill people with needs and difficulties and they don't have enough money.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this Priscila needs to study and follow up on her contacts in the area of health so she can have better work prospects in hospitals and clinics. This will enable her to bring up her children and provide them with a university education, since it is very difficult to get a good job without a degree. \r\n\r\nPriscila is grateful for the Kiva agreement under which she could be considered. She needs the support in order to achieve an important personal goal in life, as this has been her dream for several years.

Odinamo's family is large and friendly, and it increases every year. \r\n\r\nOne of Odinamo's sons works in the capital and has a grocery store there. Odinamo also plans to work in this type of business, but she decided to open a grocery store in her own city, Kulob. She already built premises for the store next to her home. What remains is to purchase goods and start selling. However, Odinamo does not have enough money for this, and therefore she applied for a loan. Odinamo has decided to purchase a broad assortment of food products for the loan amount. \r\n\r\nAfter having opened the new business, Odinamo will provide a job not only for herself, but also for the other sons. Therefore, she needs this loan very much.

She is a single mother and has two children, ages 18 and 24.  Her daughter is in ninth grade and her son no longer studies because she cannot pay for both to have an education.\r\n\r\nThe borrower lives with her two children and her mother.  From a very young age she has worked in farming which she learned from her parents who have always been farmers.  After her father passed away she became the only one to earn an income for the household.\r\n\r\nJuana will use the loan to buy fertilizers and seeds, as well as other supplies, to improve her crops.  She grows corn, beans, tomatoes, peppers, radishes, etc.  With the loan she can increase her business and sell more produce so she can pay for her daughter's education.  Her dream is to see her children become professionals so their families can have a better quality of life.  The income Juana earns is what supports her mother and two children, since she is a single mother.\r\n\r\nHer work is about one block from home and her mother and the two children help out considerably.  Juana establishes her own work schedule but sometimes leaves home in the morning at 6:00 a.m. and returns at 2:00 p.m. to sell her produce.  This loan will help resolve some of her problems and give her a better opportunity to produce more so she can have a stall at the municipal market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1515516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 30,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has two milk cows, two steers and 10 sheep, and has everything necessary to care for livestock, including hay and feed. In the winter she keeps the animals in the barn, and in the summer she sends them out to pasture and hires a shepherd to watch them. Saparbu's sons also help around the farm, and her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Saparbu has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase cows for fattening and further resale at the market for a higher price. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further augmenting the size of her herd, as well as to save toward home renovations.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":712.5,"image":{"id":1514942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Oruktuu-Say village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":67.54,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saparbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":712.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":644.96,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":35571.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":67.54,"payment_id":610751080}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T00:16:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":660655,"name":"G.s.

lograr\u00eda tener y brindarle una mejor calidad de vida a el hijo y los padres si est\u00e1 al alcance.  \nPersonalmente  lograr estudiar ser\u00eda  una bendici\u00f3n ya que estar\u00eda ella cumpliendo una  meta de las muchas m\u00e1s que ella tiene, adem\u00e1s de esto obtendr\u00eda una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y emocional  ya que tendr\u00eda m\u00e1s oportunidades de trabajo y as\u00ed mismo la opci\u00f3n de continuar  como profesional en administraci\u00f3n en salud, como tambi\u00e9n un diplomado en Auditoria y cuentas m\u00e9dicas. \nLos deseos de superaci\u00f3n de ella son enormes ya que a pesar de la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica se ha esforzado por salir adelante, en este  momento los ingresos son de menos de un salario m\u00ednimo, pues trabaja haciendo turnos en un caf\u00e9 Internet, del cual ella debe pagar un arriendo, alimentaci\u00f3n, vestuario y estudio de ella, como  tambi\u00e9n del hijo, ya que el padre del hijo no le responde por \u00e9l, entonces a ella le toca todos los gastos sola, el primer semestre ella lo hizo gracias a un descuento que tenia, pero ya para los dem\u00e1s semestres se acab\u00f3 la ayuda. \nElla  vive con el hijito no m\u00e1s en una pieza en arriendo ya que los ingresos no le alcanzan para pagar un apartamento, confiando en Dios que todo lo hace posible,  ella quiere terminar la carrera, ya que como mencionaba antes terminando ella  este t\u00edtulo se abren puertas de nuevos trabajos y de continuar estudiando ,ella se ve en un futuro ser una gran profesional, crear una cl\u00ednica, verse all\u00ed trabajando junto al  hijo y dem\u00e1s profesionales, logrando un cambio de atenci\u00f3n en salud ya que infortunadamente la atenci\u00f3n en salud en Colombia es p\u00e9sima. \nComo ya mencionaba antes la meta es continuar el profesional y bueno trabajar fuertemente, para lograr todos los sue\u00f1os.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda Naidu, who is 30 years old, decided to study to be a health administration specialist as she has always liked helping other people. An administrator gives guidance and provides solutions when, for various reasons, some patients cannot be treated or there is an unwillingness to treat them. This may be because of the current rules of the health system or because of neglect by people who work in the clinic. The idea is to improve the quality of the service for the patient and this is why she wants to study this course. \r\n\r\nAt the same time she needs the Kiva agreement, as she has limited income and does not have any family help since they come from the lower social classes and live in rural areas. She gets no government help either, which makes it impossible for her to pay for her studies. This is why she turned to the Kiva agreement, so she can continue studying for the 2 further semesters she needs in order to graduate. It is very important for her to get this degree as she would then be able to have and provide a better quality of life for her son and her parents, wherever possible. \r\n\r\nOn a personal note, being able to continue studying would be a blessing since she would be fulfilling one of the many goals she has. She would also have financial and emotional stability since she would have more work opportunities as well as the option to continue working as a professional in health administration. She would also have the option of doing a diploma in auditing and medical accounts. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Naidu has an enormous desire for self-improvement and in spite of her economic situation she has worked hard to make progress in life. At the moment her income is less than a minimum salary. She works shifts in an internet cafe and from this money she has to pay for rent, food, clothing and study for herself as well as her son. The son's father does not provide for him so she has to cover all of the costs on her own. She was able to study the first semester thanks to a discount she got, but now the help has run out for the remaining semesters. \r\n\r\nShe lives with just her little son in a rented room as her income is insufficient to pay for an apartment. She trusts in God who makes everything possible. She wants to finish her course because, as mentioned previously, by finishing her degree doors will open for new jobs and to continue studying. In the future she sees herself as a good professional, setting up a clinic where she sees herself working with her son and other professionals in order to bring about a change in healthcare since unfortunately the healthcare in Colombia is very poor. As mentioned before, her goal is to continue as a professional and really work hard to achieve all of her dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1516381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester's fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Naidu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069680},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882625},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201989},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286130},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224837}],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T13:07:46Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":650045,"name":"Osmar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Osmar es soltero, tiene 27 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Coronel Oviedo, y cuenta que tiene su taller de Carpinter\u00eda en el terreno de sus padres, y as\u00ed est\u00e1 trabajando para poder mejorar su vida.\nHace m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os habilito su carpinter\u00eda y venta de maderas aserradas, ya tiene muy buena clientela ya que hace bien su trabajo, realiza por pedidos y como le gusta al cliente.

He comes from Jinotepe, a town in the northern part of the country. He is known as a hardworking and responsible person who has a great determination to succeed. Since he was a child he has worked hard to help with the household expenses.  Unfortunately, he was not able to have an education due to his family's lack of financial resources... he is currently striving to improve his living conditions.

He is seeking the loan to invest in working capital and to stock his business buying and selling groceries so that, in the not too distant future, he will be able to boost his income.

of which only three attend school. He has eight other dependents who are ophans.  He is a farmer who deals in agriculture, specifically growing bananas and coffee. He works for five days in a week and six hours in a day.  Athanasius started his farming business way back in 1993 and was motivated by the high profits in the business.\r\n\r\nHe also supplements his income with teaching in the primary school which has enabled him to improve his living standards. He usually sells his agricultural output to the neighboring villages, especially to local customers.\r\n\r\nHe has acquired this loan facility in order to buy more fertilizers to boost his agricultural output.

He started his business in 2008.\r\n\r\nHe works 6 days in a week and 12 hours per day and started his business to improve on his family's income and livelihood because he believes if he has money then he will adequately provide for his family and dependents. He acquired this loan to purchase more coffee and maize for the business and his clients are schools that stock for student meals and coffee dealers from the nearby villages.\r\n\r\nHis hope for the future is to enlarge his business so as to increase on his income. His challenges are drought (i.e too much sunshine) and heavy rains at times.

In the future, Sani plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1516927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449730399},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459209780},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-25T09:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468029604},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-21T09:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479253079},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-27T09:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490949417},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504388028},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517889974},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530166874},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-27T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542646335},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-10T11:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2680.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561780970},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-07T11:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5360.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579738295}],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T16:35:10Z","paid_date":"2015-01-07T11:09:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":661063,"name":"Mejumaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mejumaa appreciates her previous Kiva loan, which improved her living standards.\r\n\r\nShe still operates a food stall business.

She also has a butchery in addition to the drug shop business and she says this helps her a lot since it gives her additional income which she uses to cater to the needs of the family. Her clients are people around Ishaka who go to her to buy drugs for their sick relatives.  Her main challenge is competition since there are several drug shops in the same area where she operates from but she believes that if she is given a loan of 3,000,000 UGX she will restock the drug shop and will out compete her competitors. Her future hopes include establishing other drug shop outlets so that she makes more sales and earns more profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1516926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy medicine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T15:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T15:30:05Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":504900.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459233985},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":504900.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468059429},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":504900.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479277268},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":504900.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490973852},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":504900.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504414900},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":504900.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692490}],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T17:13:29Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T17:50:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":650951,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a 23-year-old single young man from Gaza city.
