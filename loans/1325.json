The two older ones go to school. Her husband is a furniture maker.\r\n\r\nGraciela is applying for the loan for her husband to use in his business. He has a furniture making workshop in his home. Here he does a lot of work in wood, making items such as chairs, doors, beds and other things. He works from Monday to Saturday from 8am to 5pm. He does work for customers who visit his workshop and also supplies some stores in the cities of Manta and Portoviejo.

Gulbarkan has a secondary education and works as a mail carrier at the local post office. Her husband works at the local power station as an inspector. Gulbarkan is a calm, self-possessed and hard-working person by nature. Her husband and children help her in her business. As an additional source of income for her family, Gulbarkan has been raising livestock and growing produce for many years, having launched this business with a starting capital of 10,000 KGS. Thanks to Gulbarkan\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes one dairy cow an done calf, and a 1.5-ha [about 4 acres] land plot, where Gulbarkan grows cotton. Her business brings in about 10,000 KGS per month. In order to develop her business further, Gulbarkan turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan intended to buy calves. Gulbarkan plans to invest the resulting revenue in a further expansion of her farm. Also, in the future, she plans to do major renovations on her

He is married and has three children. He has a very close-knit family. They live in the countryside. Murtazo is trying to somehow make money so his family can have an income. In his spare time, he works as a taxi driver. Murtazo uses his own car for this. He earns a decent income from driving. But his primary source of income is animal husbandry. He breeds and sells livestock. In this case, he helps his wife. She cares for the cattle and also sells milk. Murtazo's livestock business brings in a good and stable income, so he wants to expand the business. He needs to buy a few head of cattle for breeding and resale. Murtazo approached Arvand for a loan to buy cattle. He hopes that this business will successfully expand and bring in more money, to better meet his family's financial needs. Murtazo thanks Arvand in advance for its support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1493943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

At age five, he enrolled in the school of faith and joy, in which he completed all of his studies, and graduated with honors on December 7, 2013. This became the most significant moment in his life and that of his whole family's. Brayan is interested in many things, namely sports, and he is a great competitor. \r\n\r\nThe most rewarding and meaningful thing in his life was getting his high school diploma, with which he will be able to do one of the things he is most inspired by. But for Bryan, there have also been hard times among his family, such as the death of his grandfather and his cousin, which affected him a lot. Yet he is a very strong person, and Brayan has overcome and confronted these difficult situations. \r\n\r\nBrayan is very kind, a little shy, and he likes to strive for all of the things that inspire him and will help him as tools to get ahead. He needs the agreement with Kiva because he and his family are not in good economic standing, and this deal would be a great help for him to be able to study the career he wants so much. Brayan chose this career because he is inspired to be a good dentist, and in this way be able to have clear goals in life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1516419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay for a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brayan Alexis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392978},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069682},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882627},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201991},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286132},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224839}],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T20:27:05Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Estrada","image":null}},{"id":661222,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Due to hardships, Zenaida helps her husband generate income by planting vegetables in their backyard and selling them in the market.

With the goal of further developing her business, Djumakan has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase cows to increase the head count of her herd.

She is married to Rey, and they have children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating a business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarife owns and oversees operation of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one jeepney (14-16 person capacity), which earns *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMarife dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1517246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marife","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T09:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3173.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450029977},{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4231.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459307466},{"amount":93.34,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4231.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467887976},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3173.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479111217},{"amount":23.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1057.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490806381}],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T20:10:09Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aya Padr\u00f3n","image":275073}},{"id":661225,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zenaida, 48, is a resident of Batasan, Quezon City, Philippines.

She has a specialist high school education and is a calm, balanced and hardworking woman. Her husband and children help with her animal husbandry business, an enterprise she began many years ago with starting capital of 5,000 KGS and which is the primary source of income for her family. Thanks to Mairambu's hard work, she now has one horse and 30 sheep, as well as a 3.54 hectare parcel of agricultural land on which she grows clover and safflower. Her business brings in about 11,000 KGS per month, which serves to cover her family's basic daily needs, including food.

He\u2019s been doing this for 45 years. He began by working in different shops over 15 years. After he had saved enough money, he decided to open his own shop. He employs two employees indirectly and is also able to pay social security. His customers are transport companies and members of the general public who come to his shop. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the loan application is to buy parts and lubricants in bulk to have enough on hand to meet his clients\u2019 needs. This will win him customer loyalty and increase his income so that he can pay bills and meet the needs of his wife and two children. \r\n\r\nJose says that he wants to close out this loan cycle in a professional way since he wants to retire after having made his business well-established.

In 2003, the couple started a business selling groceries from a rented shop, using a sum of 10,000 KGS as starting capital. Through development of the business and building a steady client base, Fatima now has an average monthly income of 12,000 KGS. Thanks to their hard work with the business, the couple has increased turnover in the shop. With the goal of further building the business, Fatima has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase wholesale food products and soft drinks to be resold in her store. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing turnover and to save money toward her children's university education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1499978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is how she\u2019s been able to give her son an education and meet household costs.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s asking for is another way she can improve her business since she needs more space for a storage shed, to buy supplies in bulk (soda, beer, meats, candy, etc.), and to pay the balance of her current loan. This will allow her to strengthen her business and meet her customer\u2019s needs, improving sales and income to support her family. \r\n\r\nAna says that her one goal is to continue her business and diversify her services so that her customers are well served.

is a 34-year-old married woman from the Moung Ruessei district, Battambang. She has five children, two of whom are employed as paid laborers in a neighboring country of Cambodia, where they expect to earn a higher wage than locally, while the remaining three children are under her care. Ram toils the land and grows rice as her main crop on around one hectare of farmland. She has been a farmer for more than 14 years.\r\nTo help improve her sanitation, Ram would like to request a loan to build a household latrine. As shown in the photo, she already bought bricks and sand for the construction; however, she needs some materials like a septic tank, cement, and top surface of the toilet. Due to insufficient capital, she is asking a loan from HKL and Kiva. Thanks to the water loan program with a special rate offered by Hattha Kaksekar Limited (HKL), Ram is encouraged to focus on ensuring healthy living conditions, to safeguard the health of her family and to protect the environment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":939.77,"image":{"id":1510628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

is passionate about everything to do with health.  She really likes healthcare administration because she thinks it's an interesting field which requires a lot of organization and concentration, and will allow her to be a productive member of the field.  It also complements her studies.  \r\nHer goals are to apply all the information she learns, and that the institute provides, so she can assist people well and give them all the help they need.  She also wants to work hard to be the best at what she does since she thinks the most satisfaction a person can get comes from helping others without expecting anything in return.  \r\nShe considers herself honest, punctual, responsible, nice, outgoing, and respectful, with lots of good principles and qualities.  From the moment she starts the program she plans to acquire all the knowledge the teachers offer and investigate things in depth so she can be the best student.  This way she can enter the field able to provide a good service for all the people.  She would also like for people already working in the field to teach her new and different things.  \r\nKaren Lorena wants to be trained to work in different areas of health such as multi-specialty and single-specialty hospitals, government sponsored healthcare providers, and the public and private sectors.  Her last goal is to have an advantageous, productive internship so she can be well trained to fill her position, perform well, and be able to continue working for the company.  The agreement with Kiva will be very helpful because the payments are more affordable and she will be able to pay off other expenses that she has."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1516443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay tuition for one semester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069686},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882631},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201995},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286136},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224843}],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T21:39:53Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:02:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kimberly Scott","image":null}},{"id":651085,"name":"Vrezh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vrezh lives in Kapan town in Syuniq region.

children together with her husband. Her oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest is 4. Her husband helps with the business, and Ainiza is a homemaker, involved in domestic household and raising the children.  Her husband works seasonally at a vacation resort and has a set seasonal income.  Ainiza has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 14 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ainiza's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 bull and a 1.2 hectare land plot, where she primarily grows potatoes, plants cereal crops and sainfoin for household consumption and sale. They sell the resulting harvest to wholesale distributors.  Ainiza and her husband are proactive about vaccinating livestock to prevent diseases.  The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk, farming and her husband's partial salary. In order to further develop her business, Ainiza requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Ainiza plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's continued education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1514956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ichke-Jerkez village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6000},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":24000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6140.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467831120},{"amount":205,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":10234.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463042},{"amount":205,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10234.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947065},{"amount":492,"local_amount":24000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":24563.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440409}],"funded_date":"2014-01-25T21:35:34Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T10:24:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":661320,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is 34 years old from Nakuru and a very determined businesswoman.

with her husband, raising five children. Gulaiym has a high school education, and as the main source of income for her family Gulaiym has managed livestock, starting 21 years ago with the purchase of cattle for the sum of 4,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni. Through hard work Gulaiym on her farm today has two dairy cows and ten sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni. In order to further develop her farm, Gulaiym applied for a loan from the Microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep to increase her livestock. Gulaiym plans to further augment the amount of domestic animals on her farm with the income from the loan, and plans to save enough money to buy a new home.

First, she creates a mold and applies a layer of paper. She almost always uses newspaper. This smooths the entire surface while fitting into irregularities in the mold. When the paper layer is dry, she repeats the process with additional layers of wet paper and a starch paste until the mask reaches the desired thickness. Afterward, she carefully peels back the mask which comes off in a block. Next, holes for the eyes and nose are drilled. She then proceeds to attach the teeth, ears, neck, hair bristles and any other addition such as rubber connections to allow movement. Horns are added based on the traditional number for decoration and\/or the number specific to the region where the masks come from. \r\n\r\nBernardina is a single mother and lives in her uncle's house with her mother. They live in El Alto in the area near 16 de Febrero.\r\n\r\nBernardina's dream in the medium term, is to have a shop where she can make masks and other crafts while at the same time reaching maximum efficiency in the various stages of production. This will result in higher product output, reduction in costs, better quality products, and the ability to export to other areas. This will increase her income and quality of life for her family. This loan is needed to buy materials in larger quantities as to save money in costs. \r\n\r\nThis the first loan she has applied for with IMPRO and her first time with KIVA.

Through hard work Ularbek today has on his farm two dairy cows, two heifers, one calf, five sheep, and also a plot of land measuring 0.48 hectares on which he grows beans, potatoes, and hay. His monthly income is 10,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni.

She and her husband are bringing up three children. Jyldyz is a college graduate. She works as a teacher in a local secondary school. As an additional source of income for her family, Jyldyz raises livestock, having launched this business 10 years ago by buying livestock for 7,000 KGS. Thanks to Jyldyz' hard work, her farm now includes one dairy cow and a small land plot, where Jyldyz grows potatoes, pumpkins and perennial herbs. Jyldyz also has an apple orchard yielding a good harvest and revenue. Her monthly revenue is 8,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Jyldyz turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan   to increase her livestock by buying a cow. Jyldyz plans to use the income from her loan for an further additional livestock increase. She plans to save money to cover further education of her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1499995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kok-Kashat village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-25T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.93,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jyldyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":411.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":386.88,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":20258.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.23,"payment_id":561578194},{"amount":290.16,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":15194.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.17,"payment_id":579488782},{"amount":186.03,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10129.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.53,"payment_id":595435968}],"funded_date":"2013-12-26T01:27:07Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":661361,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is married and lives in Bien Unido, Bohol, where she earns a living by making and selling both fresh and salted fish.

Pridon thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is in a great location and the only business of this kind in the area. After the store is opened, the family will have a stable income, which enables them to cover everyday costs as well as expand the business in the future.  \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Start Up program, Pridon will have an opportunity to be involved in his own business and tackle the financial difficulties.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1499956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to open a secondhand clothing store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Dioknisi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-12-25T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pridon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":67.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":72.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":77.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":86.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":94.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":97.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.87,"local_amount":139.79,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":144.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459141797},{"amount":46.4,"local_amount":77.32,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-26T08:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":80.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467957508},{"amount":46.29,"local_amount":77.15,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-24T09:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":79.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479178212},{"amount":48.04,"local_amount":80.07,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-02T09:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":82.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490872783},{"amount":375.4,"local_amount":625.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-30T09:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":648.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504299907}],"funded_date":"2014-02-09T04:00:15Z","paid_date":"2014-07-30T09:20:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":661375,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita is a 65- year old widow; she lives in RS tan Village, Maningcol, Ozamiz City.

She lives 10 minutes away from the town of Soledad with her spouse. She has two daughters aged 28 and 30 years. When she arrived from her hometown, she lived with an aunt who owned a store in the year 1980. Later on, Dalgi decided to sell fried foods, and she was very well-received at the venue she set up. For that reason she added broths and meals. Then later on she bought amenities comprised of a counter, kitchenware and a stove. She finally obtained fully equipped amenities with an industrial kitchen, which she bought at a good price because the previous owner went bankrupt. That's how her first business experience went. It laid the foundation for her to aspire to set up other small businesses in a neighboring country. She ultimately returned to the town of Barranquilla, bought her house and started a new venture in her home country, but on better grounds. She currently sells various merchandise from specialized product catalogs, especially cosmetics and also natural and multipurpose products. Her biggest challenge is not having enough working capital to successfully achieve her growth potential.\r\nHer previous loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo was used for her new business renting washing machines. It was even enough for her to purchase various merchandise, which she eventually sold. This increased her liquidity and she had more sales, more customers, and improved her profits. That's why she's pleased with these achievements and is applying for a Kiva loan. With it she'll purchase new washing machines, which will modernize her business and expand her clientele, as well as a lot of merchandise so she can meet the orders from her regular and occasional customers. She gives her \"thanks to Kiva lenders and to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and I hope to keep on counting on this important support in order to continue strengthening the sales and the washer rental business\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1516990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She and her spouse are raising 3 children. Their oldest son lives on his own, their second son is a migrant worker in Kazakhstan, and their daughter is in grade school.\r\n\r\nKynash has a vocational degree and currently works as a custodian at the local school. Kynash is a very responsible, friendly, life-loving person. She and her husband keep a farm with livestock and crops, which they started 20 years ago with a purchase of 4,000 som's worth of animals. Thanks to her hard work, today Kynash's farm has two dairy cows, two calves, and also 1.8 hectares of land on which they mostly grow beans and clover. The harvest is sold by wholesale vendors.  Their monthly income is 16,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of expanding her farm business, Kynash has applied to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan. The loan is for the purchase of bulls to increase their number of livestock. Once the bulls are purchased, they will be kept on their own farmland. In the summer they'll be cared for by a cowherd. Kynash plans to save the profit from the loan to accrue more farm animals, as well as to save for her son's wedding

She has been in this business for twelve years and it has provided her with a decent income and sufficient food for her family. She has been with Kiva partner VisionFund for two loan cycles. Her most recent loan, which she has repaid, has improved her lifestyle. Now, she is the leader of a two-person group. Including this loan, she and her co-borrower are in their third cycle and are requesting a new loan of 1,400,000 KHR each.  As the group leader, Vanna will spend her entire loan portion to buy fertilizer for her pineapple planting. She hopes her pineapples will produce a better yield than last year.

Nevertheless, with the goal of giving better rental services he built two houses on stilts, each one with its own entrance and latrine.\r\n\r\nModesto's dream is to build 15 homes with concrete skirting and wood skirting.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1498382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to improve the small homes he rents out","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Puerto Cabezas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":328,"posted_date":"2013-12-26T01:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T01:00:13Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":184.01,"local_amount":4568.43,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T12:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4581.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449730234},{"amount":99.65,"local_amount":2474.01,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T12:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2481.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459209628},{"amount":104.64,"local_amount":2598.03,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2605.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468029434},{"amount":102.79,"local_amount":2552.12,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T19:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2559.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479252869},{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":2648.35,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2656.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490949165},{"amount":73.91,"local_amount":1834.9,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1840.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504387690},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":1324.16,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1328.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519666187}],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T19:41:28Z","paid_date":"2014-08-23T09:33:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":661450,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel is a 47-year-old married man with five children and lives in Kyenjojo, Uganda. \r\n\r\nHe has been in commercial agriculture for four years.

The oldest son is a 22-year old student, the second oldest daughter is 20 years old and married, and the youngest son is a 14 year old schoolboy. Sabira has a secondary education. Sabira married Kachkynbay right after graduation. Sabira goes through life optimistically, knows exactly what she wants and achieves it on her own. She knows how to properly use and plan funds to achieve her goals. Sabira is the the main source of income for her family.  She raises crops and livestock, starting 23 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 4,000 KGS. Thanks to Sabira's hard work, she currently has 1 dairy cow, 10 calves, 1 horse, 10 sheep, and also farms 2.2 hectares of irrigated land and a 0.34 hectare backyard, where she mostly grows beans, clover and strawberries. She sells the crops wholesale. Sabira has all the necessary conditions to raise cattle: a barn and distant pastures.  She also has enough hay and fodder. She receives a monthly income of 16,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk, beans, and, in the summer, strawberries. In order to further grow her household, Sabira has appealed to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan for the purchase of steers for cattle breeding. Sabira plans to invest the loan income into further increasing the amount of livestock, and plans to save money to expand housing for the animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1514987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tash-Bashat village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-25T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":12793.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053549},{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":12793.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463043},{"amount":244.31,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":12793.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.94,"payment_id":561578224},{"amount":234.95,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12793.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.3,"payment_id":595436018}],"funded_date":"2014-01-26T03:49:24Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":661446,"name":"Teley Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group is made up of three hardworking members.

She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she started eight years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Indira now has one milk cow as well as a 1.5 hectare parcel of agricultural land on which she grows beans and potatoes, with a monthly income of 6,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Indira has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase steers to increase her number of livestock.

She also is very skilled at making costume jewelry. This has served her to help maintain her house since her husband is retired and the little income he gets cannot sustain them. Today, Martha is requesting a loan to invest in the construction of a bathroom in her house. Furthermore, in the future, Martha would like to run her business from her own shop so that she can reach more clients who want her products.

Being members of one of the groups benefiting from credit offered by VEP, the women have previously received water tank loans, a Mifugo (livestock) loan, and a school-fees loan, among others. This time they approached VEP for bio-gas credit that could enable them to construct bio-digesters to provide them with fuel for cooking and lighting.\r\n\r\nGrace, standing on the right with a beaded necklace, has been a farmer for over ten years. However, she had no knowledge of the benefits she could reap from the animal waste\/manure her farming produced, and has all along struggled with kerosene, charcoal, and wood. She only learned about bio-gas a year ago through a training conducted by VEP in their group, and she decided to take up the project once she completed repaying her earlier loans. Her wish is to have a smoke-free kitchen, cleaner cooking pots free from soot, and no stress from collecting wood or buying charcoal and kerosene. She says with the bio-gas, her husband will not mind warming his own meal when she is not around, unlike previously when he would stay hungry until she returned from work.\r\n\r\nThe women will also be trained on how to practice organic farming, hence improving and increasing their crop yields as a way of ensuring food security. Money saved from the purchase of charcoal and kerosene will be added to that earned from the sale of milk to enable their repayment of the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3084.38,"image":{"id":1517565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

They all come from the same village and have a good rapport. They mainly work as vendors.\r\n\r\nMrs. Aminata (seated on the far right in the photo) is the star borrower of the group. This is a woman who is skilled at managing groups. She is 47 years old, married and the mother of three sons. Her business involves selling food staples, mainly seasonings, vegetable oil and palm oil, which she buys at the central market in the township in order to retail in her village.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy packs of seasoning wholesale, to be resold  at 25 West African francs each and three jugs of palm oil at 18,000 West African francs per jug--to be resold at 100  francs per 100 ml [3.5 oz].\r\nThe revenues derived from her activity will allow her to grow her savings and increase her livestock, in order to better provide for the education of her children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3800,"image":{"id":1516017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Kholiskhon has a high school education and grows crops to provide the main income for her family. She started farming 20 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS), and thanks to her hard work she now has two greenhouses where she plants early potatoes and cabbage for personal consumption and for sales. After the seeds sprout they become seedlings, and then slowly become ready for harvesting. She currently grows one variety of early cabbage in the greenhouse. Kholiskhon's son, daughter-in-law and their children help her around the farm. She has extensive experience and the skills to grow vegetables and earns a 10,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to develop her farm Kholiskhon asked the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy seed potatoes and different varieties of cabbage seeds, as well as fertilizers and pesticides.

is a 28-year-old married woman who has been operating a business selling milk for many years. She has three cows and two calves in milk. She sells milk to many of her neighbors, along with the butter that she makes from the milk. Her business is good enough for her to lead a decent life. She is very motivated to provide her family with a beautiful life with good food and clothing.

They all live in the same village and share strong family ties.  They are small business owners engaged in various income-generating activities.  Ms. Therese (standing at the far right with her left hand raised) is the representative of this group.  Despite her young age (26), she is married and mother of a daughter and a son.
