","en":"Gulsara is a resident of the city of Dushanbe.  She is a 40 year-old married woman, who has three children.  Her husband is a worker, and children attend a school.  Gulsara is a kind, responsive and hardworking woman.  She works just as hard as her husband.  She has been involved in a sewing business for 7 years now.  Gulsara works at home.  She set a designated place for her business.  Gulsara sews national women's dresses and always makes nice fashions.

Symbat has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 18 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Symbat's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows and 1 bull. The monthly income amounts to 11,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Symbat requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a cow in order to increase livestock headcount. Symbat plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to buy a family car.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1515048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow in order to increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kurmenty village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-25T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":87.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Symbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":837.32,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":46180.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":87.68,"payment_id":610751082}],"funded_date":"2014-02-18T06:10:16Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":659378,"name":"Nuridin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nuridin was born in 1965.

Iroda's husband went to Russia for work.  Iroda has been involved in selling food products at a market for several years in a row.  Iroda started her business with a small turnover and brought merchandise a little at a time.  Today, her business is developing well, and Iroda has enough customers.  At the present time, she expanded the selection of products and started to order products from the city.  Iroda is a long-time client of MDO \"Arvand.\"  She is very happy to be working with such an organization because thanks to MDO \"Arvand\" she can always count on financial support.

He is a father blessed with four children, two of whom are in school. To cover the daily cost of living, his entire family relies on the rice-farming business and fish catching. His wife's job is working in a local factory in the area. He has been with this business for 24 years, and it has returned him about 26,400 KHR per day. The main challenge for his business is the low crop yield caused by insects. To overcome his challenge, he applied for a new loan with VisionFund, a Kiva partner. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth-cycle loan for Ol with VisionFund. The past loan, which he has repaid back with success, has enabled him to improve his living conditions at a gradual pace.

He has a wife, two sons and a daughter. His daughter gets a disability pension of 100 GEL from the local government, and his sons are learning at the university. Beglar's wife works at a school canteen and generates 500 GEL monthly. Beglar is unemployed at the moment. There is a high unemployment rate in the region, especially among people up to 40. \r\n \r\nAs the existing income is not enough for their five-member family and Beglar can\u2019t find any other job, he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Beglar applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of 2,500 USD will help him to purchase a secondhand car. Beglar will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them around the city. He is a very enthusiastic and hard-working person.

They travel around different markets with different household items, clothes, shoes and farm inputs. Their target market is households with low incomes who have to shop in open air markets where items are cheaper. The group is made up of 5 members who have been saving with VEP for the last 6 months and have a very credible reputation along with discipline. They have a vision of opening up a distribution stall where they can employ other youths to assist in sales around the local markets which open different days of the week. With this in mind, they would also like to include solar lamps into their stock as one of the products that can help those at the bottom of the pyramid without access to electricity.\r\n\r\nSamuel, the group treasurer (on the far left), was the first one to buy a solar lamp from VEP during a roadshow to their region. After experiencing the changes in his fuel budget and the quality of light, he promoted the lamp to his friends in the market who agreed to form a group and get the lamps on credit for their homes. Samuel says since he bought the lamp, he has saved a lot of money previously used to buy kerosine and for mobile charging. His children also started enjoying longer study hours which has led to improved grades.  Samuel and the group would like to see other families enjoying clean, convenient lighting while at the same time they make money from the sale of those lamps.\r\n\r\nThey have purchased different types of solar lamps from VEP on credit and, with their sale, we are confident the group will repay the loan from the profits and even take a second loan to expand the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5850,"image":{"id":1517650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy

spouse. She has an unfinished college education. As the primary source of income for her family she farms, as she has since she started 12 years ago with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work today she owns 2.3 hectares of land where each year she grows beans to sell. Her harvest is plentiful since she understands the finest details of bean farming. Her monthly income is 16,000 som (KGS).  Jarkinay came to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners to ask for a loan to buy bean seeds for planting, with the goal of further developing her business. She plans to invest earnings from the loan into farming, and also plans to save money for home repairs.

From this activity, he generates approximately 500 Georgia lari (GEL) per month. \r\n\r\nAs it becomes harder to make a living from this income only, Mushpig has decided to start an agribusiness.

His application was approved under the framework of this program for 4,000 GEL to purchase milk cows.  \r\n\r\nAfter the cows are purchased, the family will start producing dairy products -- cheese and yogurt -- to sell.

She is a wholehearted, good and industrious woman. \r\n\r\nSince childhood, Mehry has worked with fattening and breeding cattle. She has a dairy cow, which gives around 10 liters of milk every day, and she sells this to neighbors and friends. She also has calves which she fattens and sells to the butcher. Her husband, Zhabbor, works as a carpenter in a private building company. Mehry tells us that the income from that type of activity is stable, but small. Therefore, she would like to increase the number of cows so that she can increase the income from this business. She hopes very much that Arvand will support her financially."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1499972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

","en":"Khairiddin is a beginning businessman. He lives in the Farkhor district. Khairiddin is a communicative, active, and energetic young man. He is 27 years old, married, and has a three year old daughter and 1.5 year old son. Khairiddin is a singer and makes a living singing at weddings. In winter he has few bookings since people in his region prefer to celebrate weddings in the warm season. This leaves him completely without a source of income. Since his brother raises livestock - specifically the buying and selling of cattle, Khairiddin has worked the past few months with him and has learned the trade. Now that he has learned all the nuances of the business he has decided to start his own business raising and selling livestock. Khairiddin has 400 USD in starting capital, and has already built a small barn near his house. He is asking for another 2100 USD as a loan. He plans to buy 4 head of cattle and 240 kilograms of livestock feed. He already believes that his business will be successful.

This area of Guatemala is in the highlands and can be very cold. It is an agricultural area and some of the best vegetables of the country are grown here. \u201cCasa de Jesus\u201d was formed just eight months ago, and the ladies are applying for their second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. They intend to use the funds in their small businesses which include the sale of food (chicken, fruits, and vegetables) as well as everyday items including clothing and shoes.\r\n\r\nAntonia is a 33-year-old mother of three children who is married to a bricklayer. She sells food including tortillas, fried chicken, and French fries! Her two young daughters are 10 and 12 years of age and although they attend school for part of the day, they help their mother after completing their homework. Antonia\u2019s first loan helped her expand her business and now she wants to expand even more, and so she is applying for a second loan. She will use the funds to purchase additional materials for food production including gas to fry chicken and to make French fries. She wants to diversify her daily menu and will have to buy additional ingredients. Finally, Antonia plans to purchase more corn to produce more tortillas, which are usually made three times each day in Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman shares with us that she returned to school and that this year, she is in the 4th grade. She firmly believes that it is never too late to learn and attend school on Sundays. Antonia dreams of completing primary school and then will evaluate her next step, which might be to move onward to the next level. However, her children are her first priority and she wants to see them attend college. For this reason, she will work diligently at her business, keeping her goals in mind.\r\n\r\nAll of the women of the Trust Bank's \u201cCasa de Jesus\u201d wish to express their appreciation for the opportunity to secure loans through Friendship Bridge. Without this vital capital, they would be unable to maintain and\/or grow their businesses. They look forward to a better standard of living and a brighter future for themselves, their families, and their community of

Some people work at a job that they don't really like doing. Some work at two jobs and love both. One of those people is Shahlo. Shahlo is a native of the Rudaki district. She is 34 years old, married, and is raising two children with her husband. She has worked in a school as a teacher for many years. She loves children and spends a lot of time on their upbringing and success at lessons. Besides her work at the school, Shahlo works as a seamstress at home. The time she spends with her sewing machine brings her great pleasure. She loves both of her jobs and strives to finish all of her work on time. Currently, her sewing machine has started having problems, so she is asking for a loan to buy a new one. Shahlo hopes that people will help her. She is waiting for your help.

They are committed, enthusiastic and happy at the thought of additional capital to maintain and expand their businesses!\r\n\r\nSebastiana is the 32-year-old President of the Trust Bank; she has had two years of formal education, and is the mother of three children. Sebastiana fabricates beautiful bracelets with colorful beads. She is able to fill orders from current clients and is looking for additional clients at this time. Her husband helps her by selling her bracelets in fairs and bazaars along with glasses and hats. Sebastiana is applying for a new loan to purchase additional quantities of beads and beading materials. She shares with us that making bracelets is profitable and she is pleased to have this vital income. Her first priority is the education of her children as she realizes that education is a vital key to a successful future. She is happy that each of her children is enrolled in school.\r\n\r\nSebastiana and her fellow Trust Bank members learn a great deal in their monthly meetings with a loan officer from Friendship Bridge. Some of the topics covered include children\u2019s education, women\u2019s rights, business management, health, and self-esteem. Sebastiana smiles when she shares that \u201cshe and her children are learning together!\u201d\r\n\r\nAll of the women of the \u201cLuz Divina\u201d Trust Bank express their gratitude to all KIVA investors who believe in them and invest through KIVA to Friendship Bridge.

She has a high school education. Jamila earns the family's primary source of income by farming, which she started 35 years ago with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work she today owns 2.1 hectares of land where she primarily grows beans and clover. She sells her harvest to wholesalers. Her monthly income is 16,000 som (KGS). In order to earn more income and further develop her business, Jamila came to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow to increase her livestock holdings. Jamila has decided to simultaneously practice animal husbandry and raise animals. This will give her additional income from the sale of milk. In the future Jamila plans to save money to repair the animal barn.

As the only breadwinner of the family, he works hard to gather good income and provide appropriate living conditions for his family. Ashot was able to save some money for purchasing a car, and in order to pay the missing part of money, Ashot has decided to take out a loan. He asks for this loan to be able to get the remaining part of money that he needs for purchasing a car. \r\n\r\nAshot has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products.

Esperanza serves this type of loan to help their communities. In this special loan, Loida is representing her church named Iglesia de Dios Hacienda Estrella from a rural community located north of Santo Domingo. They (the church) started a water project two years ago in order to provide purified water to their community inhabitants and deliver the service at a low price but with high quality and proper standards.\r\n\r\nWith this loan they want to buy a truck to pick up and distribute the water to sellers and clients all over their community. They also want to restructure their distribution point where they sterilize gallons, fill bottles with purified water and deliver them to the neighbors that go directly to the business to buy the bottles or sellers that distribute them. By \"improve,\" they mean to buy 5-gallon water bottles and labels, change system pieces, paint walls and make other investments.\r\n\r\nLoida is the administrator in this church water project called Agua Eternity (Eternity Water). Around ten thousand people live in their neighborhood, and their plan is to distribute purified water to five thousand families, at a cost of $0.50 US for a 5-gallon bottle of water. With this, Loida said they want to impact different areas: economic, health, spiritual and many others. This community is an extremely poor area in Santo Domingo with many health problems, potable water scarcity, diseases, pollution, etc. This project is planning to distribute six thousand of these bottles whereas they now produce three thousand. This church is committed to starting as many projects as they can to contribute to the development of this community.\r\n\r\nLoida thanks God, Esperanza International, and all of you for this opportunity. In her name and the name of all of her church members, she thanks all of you for your support!

always aspired to be self-employed, and she saw her opportunity to do just that two years ago when she founded Cindy\u2019s Coastal Cleaning. The area in which Cindy lives is a tourist hotspot and the businesses in the area were often looking for local cleaners to ensure their spaces were always tidy and ready for tourists.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the opportunity, Cindy started her cleaning services business and focused on providing services to homeowners, hotels, and other businesses in the area. Now, after more than two years in operation, Cindy\u2019s Coastal Cleaning is the go-to cleaning service provider for vacation home owners, rentals, hotels, and private homes in the area.\r\n\r\nCindy focuses on not only providing quality cleaning but also green cleaning. She uses only natural products to clean and even creates her own formulas if she cannot find an existing natural alternative.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Cindy\u2019s business experienced tremendous growth, but unfortunately, she did not have the capital necessary to keep up with that growth.\r\n\r\nWith your generous contribution to Cindy\u2019s loan goal, she will be able to invest in an additional company vehicle, purchase new uniforms, hire and train new employees and purchase cleaning equipment like a carpet shampooer, vacuums, and a power washer.\r\n\r\nHelp this green entrepreneur expand her

Beatriz o Bety, quien es la representante del grupo, platica que tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con Ren\u00e9 desde hace siete a\u00f1os y juntos han formado una familia con tres hijos los cuales aun se encuentran estudiando. Bety est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para comprar pollos, tiene una peque\u00f1a poller\u00eda desde hace ya varios a\u00f1os, inicio su negocio porque anteriormente ella y su esposo trabajaban en una granja de pollos pero Ren\u00e9 sufri\u00f3 un accidente y cambiaron de domicilio. Comenzaron a vender pollo en una mesita afuera de su casa, pero con el tiempo fueron gan\u00e1ndose clientes y decidieron iniciar la venta de sus pollos en un local m\u00e1s estable pero tambi\u00e9n porque en el tiempo de lluvias se dificulta obtener ganancias. \u201cTambi\u00e9n quiero mi cr\u00e9dito para comprar juguetes porque ya se vienen las fiestas m\u00e1s grandes del pueblo son las \u00e9pocas donde m\u00e1s se vende\u201d. La dificultad para el negocio de Bety es que las personas de la comunidad no le compran la carne fresca ellas prefieren la carne de varios d\u00edas antes porque se las dejan m\u00e1s barata y esta situaci\u00f3n ocasiona que sus ventas bajen. Otro reto es cuando las autoridades de la comunidad invitan a verder a otros comerciantes a la comunidad pues tambi\u00e9n le afecta en sus ventas. Sin embargo, Bety y Ren\u00e9 son muy trabajadores y seguir\u00e1n con su negocio para cumplir su meta que es lograr construir granjas y criar pollos para ser proveedores en un futuro. Las integrantes del grupo son: Lety, quien invertir\u00e1 en una tienda de abarrotes; Yolanda y Margarita, en borregos.","en":"The \u201cLa Labor\u201d group is located in a tranquil community where the residents still raise corn and are friendly.

Another challenge is when the community authorities invite other merchants to the town and this also affects her sales.\r\n\r\nHowever, Bety and Rene are hard workers and they will continue their business so they can reach their goal of building farms and raising chickens so they can become suppliers in the future.

Uyalkan has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 43 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 200 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has one foal, one steer, one calf and 15 sheep, with a monthly income of 9,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Uyalkan has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase additional sheep. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing her quantity of livestock, and to put some money toward building a new

three children with her husband. Maral has a high school education, and to earn the primary source of income for her family she practices animal husbandry. She started this work 15 years ago with the purchase of 20,000 som (KGS) of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work she now owns eight milk cows. She has everything needed to raise animals, including 600 bales of ready feed. With eight milk cows she sells 80 liters of milk per day to wholesale buyers. Her monthly income is 20,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her business, Maral contacted the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cows to increase her herd. She plans to invest earnings from use of the loan into further expanding her herd of livestock, and also plans to save money for her children's future education.

and has four children with her husband. The two eldest, daughters, are married, and the two sons are working in Russia at a furniture factory and help their parents financially. Gulkhan's husband works at a mercury factory as a mechanic. Gulkhan has a high school education. To earn the family's primary source of income she practices animal husbandry, which she began 19 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work Gulkhan now owns three milk cows and two sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further expanding her business she contacted the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cows for fattening and resale at the market for a profit. She plans to invest earnings from use of the loan into continued expansion of her herd. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1515310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bojoy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-25T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":32.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulkhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7177},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7289},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7501},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7720},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7945},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8177},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8415},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8661},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8913},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9173},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9441},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9588}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.54,"local_amount":7177,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7190.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459019793},{"amount":145.78,"local_amount":7289,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7302.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467831127},{"amount":150.02,"local_amount":7501,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7514.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053555},{"amount":154.4,"local_amount":7720,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7734.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749715},{"amount":158.9,"local_amount":7945,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":7959.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178458},{"amount":163.54,"local_amount":8177,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":8192.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463050},{"amount":168.3,"local_amount":8415,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947071},{"amount":173.22,"local_amount":8661,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8676.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440417},{"amount":170.52,"local_amount":8913,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8929.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.74,"payment_id":561578230},{"amount":539.57,"local_amount":28202,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":28253.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.47,"payment_id":579488817}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T21:21:15Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":661741,"name":"Seanghai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Originally from a rural village of the Ponhea Krek district of Kampong Cham province, Seanghai is a 31-year-old married mother of three children.

She and her husband are raising four children. In 2012 she and her husband began a grocery business in a rented store, with 30,000 som (KGS) in starting capital. Having started their own business and won regular customers, Inayat now has a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS). Sales have been stable. Their inventory includes foodstuffs, cold drinks, and children's toys. Thanks to their tireless work with the business, they can now buy livestock - a milk cow and calf.

together with her husband is raising 3 children.  Erkin has a secondary education.  Erkin's work in animal husbandry, beginning 17 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 20,000 KGS, serves as the major source of income for her family.  Thanks to Erkin's hard work, she now has 1 horse and 10 sheep in her herd.  Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS.  With the goal of increasing the size of her herd, Erkin turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows for breeding.  With the money from the loan, Erkin plans to invest in the further expansion of her herd.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1435,"image":{"id":1500615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Guatemala, are starting their second nine-month cycle with the Namaste Foundation.  As with their first cycle, they will receive a business advisor who will help them write a business plan and then work with them monthly to implement that plan.  They will also receive a loan and some financial education.  These women are all illiterate and have businesses selling different types of food.\n\nManuela (2nd from right) is 30 years old and married with five children, ages 2, 6, 9, 12 and 15.  The four oldest children are in school.  Her husband works in agriculture and helps her with household and family expenses.  They live in a house made of corrugated metal and her dream is to increase her sales and profits enough to build a proper house for her family.\n\nFor 13 years she has been selling fish, vegetables and tomatoes in her village.  She has a lot of experience selling these products and is well known and respected in her community.  These factors have allowed her to sell a lot of product.  At the end of her first nine-month cycle with Namaste she had profits of 3,729 Guatemalan Quetzales (approximately US $497).  She was very successful at growing her business during that cycle and in the last few months she increased her profits by an average of 30% per month.  She would like to maintain that growth rate and projects profits of 7,586 Quetzales (about US $960) by the end of this cycle.  With her loan she will be buying more product to sell, and in the coming months she will be exploring new markets and continuing to improve the administration of her business.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1498709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fish and vegetables to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Andr\u00e9s Villaseca, Retalhuleu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-12-26T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":944.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":944.47,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T11:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":962.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449639192},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":944.47,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":962.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459105546},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":944.47,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":962.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467920422},{"amount":122.23,"local_amount":944.47,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":962.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479141192},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":944.32,"processed_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":962.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490835109},{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.15,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":0.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504261237},{"amount":337.92,"local_amount":2611.18,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:43:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2660.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543529},{"amount":150.95,"local_amount":1165.43,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1187.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026834}],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T15:43:46Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T12:18:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":661680,"name":"Lumiere Celeste 1-5 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Augustin est le coordinateur de son groupe Lumiere Celeste 1-5.

She is 27 years old. Since childhood, she has loved the field of health and helping others, but, like everybody else, her life has not been easy. She had the opportunity to study medicine, but had to give it up because of financial problems. After going through a difficult situation with her family, she no longer had their support. She decided to make a life decision, and that is when she left home.\r\n\r\nAt that point, she was determined to find a job to support herself and to return to her education, so she got started with nursing. She enrolled in school, made it to her third semester, and was doing clinical practice in the Fontib\u00f3n hospital. What she didn't know what that she was pregnant; she was four months along. She found out through routine exams that she had to do at a check-up, and wow... surprise.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, she was crying because she didn't know what to do. She recalls that upon seeing the first ultrasound, all that mattered to her was knowing whether the baby was okay, whether it had all its fingers and toes, and that she cried with joy.\r\n\r\nThank God, despite everything, the baby was born safe and sound. She waited to complete her degree and she quit her job. She stayed home two months with the baby and then began looking for work. That's how she ended up where she is currently working; it's a place where they gave her a chance to better herself and to support herself, and she has been able to give her son everything he needs.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to return to her education, and she started looking for a way. That's how she registered online at Campo Alto; she also wanted to be able to do her clinical practice at night and for her studies not to interfere with her job. \r\n\r\nUpon starting her first semester, everything went well until she started to be overwhelmed by her expenses. Even then, she has always stayed on top of her payments and outstanding items. She has always been determined to be a great student and above all, to be dedicated to what she does. At the end of the last semester, she was a little worried because she couldn't pay off what she owed for that semester, but in the end she managed to come up with the money and pay it off. She still owes, but she is getting there little by little. \r\n\r\nBecause she did so well academically, Karol is asking for Kiva's support. This will help her to not be so worried every month about her payments, and it would be a great help toward her being able to fulfill her goals and plans and be able to prove to herself and to her son that she can make it without anyone's help. In addition, her little baby is already starting at nursery school this year, and that will be an additional expense. \r\n\r\nSo that is the story of Karol, a real warrior, and of how Campo Alto has been a great chance for her to overcome her challenges, as they provide great opportunities to their students.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1516329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-25T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karol Stephanie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392974},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069673},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882617},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201981},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286122},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":149028.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224829}],"funded_date":"2014-01-25T21:13:12Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":651419,"name":"Herminia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Herminia is a 47-year-old married woman from Cortes, Bohol.

Tarikhan has a secondary education.  Tarikhan's work in animal husbandry, which began 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS, serves as the major source of income for her family.  Thanks to thTarikhan's hard work, she now has in her herd 3 milk cows and 50 sheep.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.

She was born in Songkwaa, a Hmong village that was \u201cresettled\u201d by the Thai government during the communist uprising.  When she grew up, she married a man who lived in Huay Hom Village and together they helped found a new community in Phrae Province. \n\nAfter many years of hard work in the fields and raising her family, Mae has reached the age when Hmong women would traditionally transition to \u201cretirement\u201d pursuits, like cooking for grandchildren and sewing clothes for their families.  With the onset of store-bought clothing and prepared food, many older Hmong women feel left behind and worry that they are a burden to their families. \n\nIn light of her changing circumstances, Mae jumped at the chance to weave hammocks.

For almost three decades, she has explored the importance of and benefited from having a strong connection between body and mind. When she realized that her Brooklyn neighborhood was missing a sacred space where people could go to de-stress and connect with their bodies, Grace also noted that the yoga world, in Brooklyn and across New York City, was not reflective of the city\u2019s diverse population.\r\n\r\nEager to fill this void, Grace opened her yoga, dance, and pilates studio, \u201cMove with Grace\u201d, in January 2007. \u201cI found that before I opened, the yoga world was very homogenous and it was hard to find a place that was welcoming and had the diversity that reflected the city I lived in. I became one of, if not the only, African-American owned yoga studios in the city. It was important for me that all people would feel welcome to practice and enjoy yoga.\u201d\r\n\r\nSince her business\u2019s inception, Grace has added a small juice bar in the studio and also offers a small selection of products like yoga mats, skincare products, and water bottles. However, according to this inspiring entrepreneur, her greatest success has been the time she spent at the Lineage Project, a non-profit organization that teaches yoga to at-risk and incarcerated youth. Offered a position as a board member, Grace denied the position and instead offered to be an instructor, working with the at-risk youth face-to-face. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important work I have ever done,\u201d Grace says of the experience.\r\n\r\nNow, this generous entrepreneur needs your help. With your contribution to her loan goal, Grace will pay for renovation costs that will allow her to expand her studio. The loan will also allow Grace to expand the selection at her juice bar and pay for marketing materials, signage, social media marketing, and new employees.\r\n\r\nHelp Grace expand her business today, and check out her fitness studio at www.movewithgrace.com.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6425,"image":{"id":1515624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for renovation costs for her dance and yoga studio.
