She found a good man who appreciates her.  He works as a farmer.  Ana has only a 3rd grade education, because due to her family's poverty she was not able to continue with her studies.  She has 3 children who are all in relationships.\r\n\r\nAna has a store in her house.  She has worked ever since childhood.  Previously she worked in agriculture because her parents were farmers, but when they died she was raised by her grandmother.  Ana's store is in her house.  She has no set work schedule, but she tends to her customers as they arrive.\r\n\r\nAna is requesting a loan from Fundacion Campo to buy more merchandise for her store, and also so that she can work tending a school cafe that is close to her home.  She knows that this will increase her workload, but it will also increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ana wants to see her business fortified.  This would give her financial stability and enable her to help her children.  Also, she appreciates the confidence being placed in her with respect to this loan.  She knows that this loan will propel her towards accomplishing her goals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1498938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-12-26T20:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T20:40:11Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Orphan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":49.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":53.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":61.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":66.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":73.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":79.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":103.99,"local_amount":103.99,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":103.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088502},{"amount":57.55,"local_amount":57.55,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":57.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902756},{"amount":102.28,"local_amount":102.28,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":102.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817315},{"amount":62.22,"local_amount":62.22,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":62.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242782},{"amount":483.06,"local_amount":483.06,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":483.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525856},{"amount":275.42,"local_amount":275.42,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":275.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500451},{"amount":115.48,"local_amount":115.48,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":115.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544183}],"funded_date":"2014-02-21T16:25:09Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:31:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":650628,"name":"Lenin Martin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Lennin es originario de la ciudad de Boaco, de 45 a\u00f1os de edad.

He only learned to sign his name. This is because he was the eldest of seven siblings and had to help his parents with the work. His wife and their three older children help him to farm. Five children live with him and they are going to school. He has farmed all his life, a livelihood that he learned at a young age, as their family was low-income and had to make a living.\r\n\r\nCurrently, apart from farming, he looks after a plantain crop from which he earns extra money from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. when he comes back. This is because he has to travel around an hour by bicycle. He will use the money from the loan to buy seed, manure, and better quality fertilizers than what he has now.

It is also worth mentioning that he was in the United States 7 years, but he came because his children needed him since his wife was not taking good care of them.\r\n\r\nAt present, he works in fishing. He has a boat he takes out. He learned this from his father since the region where they live, most people make a living this way. Two childhood friends help him with the fishing. They do not have a schedule, they take off and leave for up to two or three days until they have managed to catch something. When they return they divide the profits between the three of them. On some occasions it goes well for them and other times they do not even recover expenses but this is the way he makes a living.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from the loan to purchase more and better nets and fishing bait. There are times when they do not fish enough or the nets break on them because they are too old.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to get ahead for his children, to see them fulfilled and to see that they have a different life than the one he had. He has faith that by means of the loan he'll be able to earn better profits and achieve a better quality of

She was in school until the third grade, because her parents thought that education was not useful and that only learning a trade would help her in life. Currently, her husband works in agriculture and as a private guard. All of her 5 children are married.<br \/><br \/>At this time, Isabel has had a stall for selling tortillas for 15 years. She learned to do this out of necessity, owing to the bad decision on her parents' part. In addition, she sells bread in the afternoon in the areas around her canton, where she has to walk around 5 kilometers. She starts working at 6:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., when she returns home to rest.<br \/><br \/>She will use the money from the loan to invest in selling bread. She is thinking of hiring 2 more people to help her, and also of making improvements on the stall where she sells her tortillas. All this will make more work for her, but she is sure of getting more income.          <br \/>                                  <br \/>Isabel's dreams are to see her children better off financially and to help them to be able to have better opportunities than they have now. She is sure that this opportunity of having an excellent credit record will open many doors for

As the name indicates, at the edge of this town there is a mighty river which attracts visitors.  Do\u00f1a Graciela is a 50 year-old professor with 28 years of service educating children and young people who are the future of Nicaragua. She is a very well loved teacher in her community because she helps those who need it the most in any way she can, and because she is patient teaching children to read and write.  She is a single mother with three children, two of whom are school-aged and live with her.  They have had a hard life without the support of their father, and she has used her low salary to pay for food, education, and healthcare to raise them.  Nevertheless this has not been an obstacle to her goal of preparing them for a profession, and they are on track to a better future.  Professor Graciela needs a loan to purchase school supplies and to pay school fees for her children now that the school year is about to begin.  She needs the support of Kiva lenders to finance this loan through Ceprodel.  It will be a great help to her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1517144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to purchase school supplies and pay school fees.

She is a mother and lives with her common law husband. Both work.  She sells corn tamales and her partner works in fishing. Due to limited opportunities, she was only able to attend school until the 3rd grade.  For this reason she has a business in the informal sector.  Claudia has two sons.  The first is 7 years old.  He attends elementary school and is in the first grade.  His younger brother is 3 years old and does not attend school yet due to his young age. This couple is very hard working and say they feel very blessed to have work.  Work is the source of income that allows them to pay for the things they need for their home and to improve the lives of their family.  Thanks to their efforts, they own the home where they live. \r\n\r\nClaudia started her business selling corn tamales in the informal sector as a last resort to support her husband, because fishing is seasonal work. With them both working it is easier to provide for their children.  Like all working women, she decided to support her household with a job that would allow her to make money to improve the difficult situation they experienced when her husband was the only one working.  After getting advice from friends and family, she approached people who had businesses selling tamales and learned from them how the business works.  She now has 3 years of experience and a large group of customers, which helps her improve sales and earn more.  All of this allows her to make money to support her partner and her family.  She has a stand in the market, where she works from Monday to Sunday from 3pm to 5pm.  She prepares the tamales in the morning and then takes public transportation from her home 6 kilometers to her business.\r\n\r\nClaudia is requesting a loan to improve her business.  She wants to expand her product selection and offer more variety to her customers.  She believes that with 100% of the loan amount she will be able to achieve this goal.  She states that by offering more variety she can increase her sales, keep and expand her customer base, and convert her business into one that is more competitive.  Her products have been so well received that she now takes special orders and her sales increase during holidays.  She is very motivated by being able to invest money in her business. \r\n\r\nThrough her experience in the tamale business, Claudia believes that getting a loan will enable her to grow her business by diversifying her products.  She will also have more income for her family. One of her greatest dreams is to help her children succeed and for them to become professionals.  She also wants to support her life partner so that the family's living conditions will be better.  With the support of CREDICAMPO she hopes to make her dreams a reality.  She will continue to be what she always has been, a women with the desire to work and succeed. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1517670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to increase her stock and offer a greater variety of products to her customers.

The construction of the wall is particularly important and urgent because when it rains the water carries away the earth, leaving dangerous holes which can impact the foundation of the house. Because of this, Teresa needs to pursue construction projects  which will provide security and hygiene to their family home.\r\n   "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1498960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cement, sand, iron, blocks and tiles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2013-12-26T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa Del Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.03,"local_amount":1461.74,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T09:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1499.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449536499},{"amount":58.39,"local_amount":1445.82,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T08:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1483.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459001462},{"amount":59.13,"local_amount":1464.2,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T09:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1502.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467811723},{"amount":348.45,"local_amount":8628.24,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8852.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636136633}],"funded_date":"2014-01-20T11:21:48Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:12:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":651573,"name":"Simaolo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simaolo is 43 years old and single, with two children. \r\n\r\nShe has a small vegetable garden to earn a living.

Without power, Teresa must rely on either costly kerosene for lighting her home and shops or small solar lanterns.  Neither of these provide power that Teresa can use for activities that will improve her and her childrens\u2019 lives or her business activities.  With the loan, Teresa can connect to the micro-grid installed in Ololailumtia.  The solar powered micro-grid will deliver 240V AC electricity to Teresa's home and shops.  \n\nTeresa\u2019s home of Ololailumtia is a rural village, almost 100km and at least a three hour drive from the national grid power.  The village sits on the edge of the Maasai Mara and serves as a commercial hub for both the Maasai residents and safari camp workers inside the reserve.   With power in her shop, Teresa can use a refrigerator to sell cold drinks and other items.  These are a rare commodity in her village and the profit she generates can be re-invested into her business.  She also can offer more hair services in her salon because she has electricity to use electric hair clippers and for TV and radio to attract customers.  Teresa estimates that on a given market day, she can sell over 100 sodas and give enough haircuts to cover her entire monthly electricity spending.  \n\nTeresa will also be able to provide more for her family with a source of electricity.  Teresa will be able to have more lighting for her home and shops, and at a much cheaper price than kerosene, giving her extra income to spend on her children\u2019s school fees or re-investing in her businesses.  She will also be able to power a laptop computer for her family to use.   Teresa is ecstatic about the possibility of having a connection to the micro-grid in her home and shops \u2013 the access to reliable and affordable power will transform how she runs her businesses and provides for her family.  \n\nAside from Teresa, 10 other members of the village are also a part of the loan connecting to the grid:  Sammy, Dorcas, Elizabeth, Mary, Habon, Rashid, Amos, John, Mbugua, and Pauline.

She was able to fertilize half of a plot which produced 12 bushels of corn.  She had to buy 6 quintals of fertilizer, 3 of herbicide, and she used the rest of the money for clearing and paying the labor to apply the products she purchased. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the support of Kiva investors and the COMIXMUL cooperative.  She feels that they are very interested in the welfare and development of every one of the small farmers and it is for that reason that she is again asking the institution for a second loan. With this loan she will be able to tend and maintain a whole plot of land planted with corn. Her plans are to continue working with the cooperative and stated funds because the rate of interest is reasonable and it allows her to build her own strong capital and not rely on financing to grow her crops. She hopes that she can once again be supported with a new loan so she can attain her goals, plans and dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1498953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy new agricultural supplies to tend to a cornfield","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-26T23:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-24T23:20:19Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.05,"local_amount":901,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-26T10:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":916.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579541415},{"amount":554.95,"local_amount":11099,"processed_date":"2015-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":11296.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762850}],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T10:40:16Z","paid_date":"2015-02-26T10:25:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":650661,"name":"Johana Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Johana, una mujer de 29 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de dos hijos y cabeza de hogar.

She used to be a housewife when she lived with the father of her children, but later after 12 years he abandoned them, leaving them without a means of support.  At this time, she had to take over the responsibility of paying for the household expenses.  With the need to oversee the livelihood and welfare of her children, Johana learned to operate a sewing machine with the help of a neighbor.  She gradually acquired skill and knowledge.  She started out working as a polisher in different workshops, but later she started to sew, and thanks to this, she is currently working as a dressmaker for third parties.  She works every day from 7am until 8pm.  One disadvantage is that she doesn't have her own sewing machine; instead she pays to rent one from a neighbor.  However, she has been able to generate the income that she needs this way over the last 6 years that she has been in this line of work.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Johana needs a loan to buy a coverstitch and overlock (industrial) sewing machine, and also to buy supplies at wholesale (fabric, thread, elastic, etc).  This will allow her to have her own machines, which will make her business more profitable because she won't have to pay rent to make her garments.  In addition, this will provide her with the ability to acquire new contracts, thereby increasing her family's income.\r\n\r\nJohana's main goal is for her business to become even more recognized and fortified so that in the future she can possibly expand it to increase her sales and generate financial stability, enabling her to provide for her

She is married to Andres and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDonata operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php25,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nDonata dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes that her children will finish their studies.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1501258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

","en":"Cristina (in the photograph she's wearing a brown shirt and standing at the side with her husband and baby) belongs to Oasis Communal Bank, located in the Biob\u00edo region of Arauco.  The members of this bank are in different lines of work: selling coffee and tea in markets; message and packing services; selling new clothing and athletic clothing; selling curtains and perfume; department store, fruit sales, liquor store, and stationery store; weaving and embroidery.\r\n\r\nCristina studied sewing and tailoring for four years.  Five years ago she started her business making costumes.  Previously she worked in a tailor shop, where she realized that her strength was making costumes.  Her problem is she doesn't have anyone to take care of her young daughter, who currently goes to work with her.\r\n\r\nThe money Cristina's requesting is to buy supplies such as fabric, needles, and thread so she can keep on making curtains and costumes.\r\n\r\nWhat Cristina has enjoyed most about working with Fondo Esperanza is meeting people from different backgrounds, meeting with counselors who can help and support them, and sharing life experiences, which is a big help.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6425,"image":{"id":1499626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

Ulugbek's brothers are involved in reselling cattle.  He sees this as a profitable business and decided to also start this business.  Ulugbek saved almost 700 dollars.  He is requesting the remaining sum of 800 dollars as a loan.  Ulugbek plans to use this money to buy 4 heads of bulls.  Obviously, his brothers will be helping him with the business by advising him what breed of bulls to buy and how to raise and sell them.  This is why he believes in the success of his business and hopes for

young man, who is 28 years old.  He was born and raised in a village.  Umedjon is married and has three children.  He works as a teacher at a local school, but because he has a large family, the salary that he earns at the school is not enough.  This is why Umedjon started his own business and hopes to expand it in order to earn enough income.  He is additionally involved in animal husbandry.  He has also been partnering with Arvand for a long time.  He obtained his first loan to buy first livestock.  Umedjon is a conscientious client, who repays his loan responsibilities timely.  Umedjon says that after he started partnering with Arvand, his life changed for the better, and he thanks Arvand for the financial support.  Now Umedjon wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock in order to expand his business and earn more profit.  He hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1495897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Zafarjon is involved in his own business in order to have an income for living.  Zafarjon has been working as a taxi driver for a long time.  He owns a car for this occupation, but this car has been serving him for a long time and had to be repaired many times.  This is why he is currently planning to purchase a new, improved car in order to run and expand his business.  This business yields a good income for Zafarjon, but it is only enough for living expenses.  And he needs money to buy a new car.  This is why Zafarjon came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy a car in order to run his business.

He is married and has three children.  He was born still lives in a mountaineous village.  Since childhood, he had learned animal husbandry from his father.  He gained so much experience that now he is running this business by himself and earns a good and stable income with it.  Olimjon is also a client of Arvand and is a responsible client.  Today, he has already raised and sold livestock that he had.  He spent the resulting profit on providing for his children.  And now Olimjon wishes to buy several more heads of livestock for fattening up and subsequent resale.  This is why he came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock.  He hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand for the support in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1496909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-12-27T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-25T07:00:05Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olimjon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":9600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1476.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1523.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1572.48},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1622.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1674.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1729.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":353.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":364.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":311.5,"local_amount":1476.76,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1486.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585619},{"amount":321.45,"local_amount":1523.87,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1534.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081197},{"amount":1392.05,"local_amount":6599.37,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6644.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562078}],"funded_date":"2014-02-23T17:51:23Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":651703,"name":"Faasaveve","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faasaveve is 42 years old and married with six children.

Dinarkhan's work in animal husbandry, which began 13 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS, serves as the major source of income for her family.  Thanks to Dinarkhan's hard work, she now has 1 milk cow and 30 sheep in her herd.  Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS.

Zulaika has a secondary education.  Zulaika's works in animal husbandry, which began 30 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 500 KGS, serves as the major source of income for her family.  Thanks to Zulaika's hard work, she now has in her herd 2 milk cows, 20 sheep, and 3.5 hectares of land on which she grows beans and perennial herbs.  Her monthly income is 7000 KGS.  With the goal of increasing her herd, Zulaika turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows for breeding.  With the income from the loan, Zulaika plans to invest in the further expansion of her herd, and also plans to save towards purchasing furniture.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1500646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karasay village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-27T09:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-25T09:40:11Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":142.99,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulaika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":615},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":820},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":615}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":578.75,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":30306.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":36.25,"payment_id":561578200},{"amount":771.68,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":40408.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":48.32,"payment_id":579488786},{"amount":556.58,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":30306.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":58.42,"payment_id":595435979}],"funded_date":"2014-01-29T20:05:09Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":661601,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisco, es jefe de su hogar, vive con su familia integrada por su esposa y sus hijos, no posee ayuda del extranjero, aprendi\u00f3 de su familia a comercializar ganado y tener crianza de peces, adem\u00e1s para obtener mejores ingresos instalo una tienda en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n, lo apoyan su esposa y sus hijos para realizar dichas actividades.\nUtilizar\u00e1 el capital para mejorar la infraestructura de las piscinas en donde tiene los peces y comprara ganado para luego venderlo a mejor precio, lo que le da oportunidad de fortalecer grandemente su negocio para luego obtener mejores ganancias cancelar sus cuotas y dar un mejor estilo de vida a su familia.\nAspira mejorar su econom\u00eda para cancelar con rapidez la deuda y seguir mejorando su negocio.\n","en":"Francisco is the head of his household, living with his family made up of his wife and children.

","en":"Davron is a hard-working man.  He was born in 1988 and he is married with two children.  His wife stays at home and looks after the children, so Davron is the only breadwinner in the family.  He used to work as a painter, but his income from this work was small and it wasn't enough to live on.  Davron has decided to start his own business as a minibus driver.  With that goal in mind, he has turned to IMON for a loan of 8,500 somoni to buy a minibus.  He is awaiting your kindness and counting on your

He studied through ninth grade, is single, and still lives with his mother. His parents separated 4 years ago. Under those circumstances, he decided to stay with his mother. 2 people are dependent on Edwin.\r\nEdwin is a small farmer and grows corn, beans, greens, and other agricultural products that help him to survive. He has been doing this for 12 years and his father taught him the work. In addition to farming, he also works as a laborer to bring in additional money for the household at times when he isn't working his own land.\r\nHis work is located about 2km from his home and he travels on foot and, when the occasion warrants it, uses a cart pulled by a team of oxen. He works 6 hours a day.\r\nThe loan that he is requesting will be used to buy a fumigating spray for his fields, which is an important tool in agricultural production. \r\nThis will improve production, and he will be able to spray insecticide and the herbicides that are important for managing pests. The need he is meeting is the need to control pests in order to improve production.\r\nEdwin's greatest dream is to have his own land to grow staple crops. He is currently renting the land he grows on and his dream for his family is to support them in achieving their dreams. The loan will help him to improve his agricultural productivity and so to improve his income. He will have more produce to sell and this will help him to have better profits and cover his expenses and next season he will farm more land and grow his business.

They live in Bogor, a city located at a one-hour drive from Jakarta, the capital city. \r\n\r\nAfter joining Ruma, Ade has access to a loan that he needs as working capital.

He lives with his brother, Berdia, who works as a private worker with a very low and unstable wage, due to the demand in the market, and generates approximately 250-300 GEL monthly.  Nodar is involved in agricultural activities.  He has chickens and trades with eggs at the local market.  However, income from this activity isn't enough to meet all his family's needs.  So, Nodar decided to be involved in another sphere parallel of agricultural activity. He requested a loan to purchase a secondhand car and start a taxi business.  All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Nodar applied for credit to MFO Credo.  His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. To reach that goal, Nodar needs a loan of 3,500 GEL. He highly relies on the goodwill of the lenders and will appreciate their support in collecting the needed amount of the loan to maintain and develop his business.

With the profit, her husband wants to open a new auto mechanic shop in the future.

Her husband\u2019s continual mental harassment and torture still haunt her, even though it has been five years that they are separated. \r\n\r\nThe group resides in a small town, which is about 62 kms from from the main capital town of Imphal. All of the group members stood for each other in terms of moral and financial assistance.\r\n\r\nElizabeth runs a paan-dukan in the neighbourhood.  She sells small sachets of different edible items like potato chips and popcorn, and also shampoo, detergent soap and detergent powder. Paan (a mixture of betel leaves, nuts and dry tobacco leaves) are the main item that sells the most in the neighbourhood. The generated income is small, but she manages to roll the business well and fine. However, she could not possibly try the shop expansion because of lack of capital money. Besides, she also takes care of her brother\u2019s kid and provides school fees on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more supplies for the shop to generate more income. She also managed to repay her previous loan successfully. She says that if Kiva continues to support the women\u2019s group and continues building relationships, she is sure to expand her shop and turn it into a variety shop. She says, \u201cThank you Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in a paan shop, hotel, weaving, selling tobacco juices and running a stamp shop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1501452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase more stock like milk powder, cereals and betel nuts\/leaves to sell to make an income and support the child's education.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-12-27T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-25T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rangkung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muanlian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khawizavung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Singlian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-06T02:18:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":650591,"name":"Juliane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliane, 31, came from the south because her family wanted a better life.

However due to the lack of funds, he finds it difficult. \r\n\r\nTherefore his wife Bushra, as a member of a two-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of products like sugar, rice, biscuits, beans, cooking oil, etc  to sell in the market at a profitable price. With the profit her husband wants to grow his business in the future. Suriya is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1501418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called \"pasal,\" are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, produce, and shrewd businesswomen. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase

She is married and has no children.  She did not have the chance to go to school because her parents were not able to support her because their income was too low.  It was her parents who taught her to work the land at a very early age, since they were not able to provide her the opportunity to attend school.  They taught her the methods and techniques that contributed to her growth and development.  Her support to develop the field comes from her husband who is also a farmer and has been since he was very young, just like her.  They specialize in coffee and this is their only source of income, with their farmland being near their home and she walks there with her husband.  Her plans for the future are to raise more parcels of coffee, improve her home by installing electricity via solar panel or cabling as part of a project near her home.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan so she can improve her coffee crops by buying fertilizers, seedlings, and weeding her fields so that they will develop better and be protected from disease, vermin and other things."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1498811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming supplies.

After her husband died, Vera took over raising crops and livestock to generate income to feed her family.  She started this business 25 years ago with 1,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her tireless and detailed work, Vera has been quite successful in developing her farm and she now generates a monthly income of 13,000 som (KGS).  Today her farm has two dairy cows and one donkey.  She gets help from her younger daughter, who is a homemaker, and son-in-law, a butcher.  They have a small income.  With the goal of developing her business further, Vera has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy hay and feed for her animals over the winter.

Joshua has been a member of the group since 2012 and he is the group\u2019s chairperson.\r\n\r\nHe has been learning better farming methods within his group and desires to use hybrid seeds and fertilizers on his farm to grow maize, sorghum and millet during the 2014 long rains seasons.  He is, however, constrained financially and is hoping to receive a loan from Kiva that will enable him to purchase these farm inputs. He believes that the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer will increase his yields and he will not only get enough food for his family, but will also sell the surplus and obtain capital to start a business to supplement his farming

The group is based in Kuria West District. They have come together in order to grow, socially and economically, through agriculture.\r\n\r\nBaraka is 24 years old and married, and he has two children. One of the children goes to school. He is a first-time member of the group. He is very excited about joining the group. He believes this will provide a good platform for him to learn better farming methods that will increase his harvest significantly.\r\n \r\nBaraka will grow sorghum, millet and maize, in a one acre farm, during the 2014 long rains. Therefore, he is requesting a loan from Kiva.  He will buy hybrid seeds and fertilizer with the loan, which is expected to enable him to have a bountiful harvest during the 2014 harvest period. He will secure food for his family and sell the surplus. He will use the money he earns to pay back the loan and to invest in another business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1483308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for growing maize, sorghum and millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2013-12-27T16:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-25T16:40:16Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baraka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":24150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":24150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":24150,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-07T09:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":25994.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468017133}],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T22:50:10Z","paid_date":"2014-05-07T09:25:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null}]}
