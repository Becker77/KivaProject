She is a villager from Sangke\u2019s District of Battambang Province. To earn a living, she has been buying and selling kapok in the village. To add up more income, she also works for others for a fee as the main source of income. \n\nThe business that she has had for more than 10 years has generated her about 31,200 KHR per day.  This is the sixth loan for Bopha with VisionFund, Kiva\u2019s partner. The positive impact of her past loan has enabled her to improve her business better than before. For this cycle, she has teamed up in a group of four to get a new loan. \n\nAs a leader, she will spend her entire loan portion to buy more kapok to resale. She hopes that she can achieve a good crop yield.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1492113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more kapok to resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-12-27T17:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-25T17:40:20Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bopha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Theab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sovan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":5600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":466800},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":465200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.78,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440093384},{"amount":118.79,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-19T10:21:38Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450136130},{"amount":118.78,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T16:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459240866},{"amount":118.79,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468066040},{"amount":118.78,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479283774},{"amount":118.78,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490980285},{"amount":118.79,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504421318},{"amount":118.78,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517698829},{"amount":118.79,"local_amount":466800,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":474830.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530249523},{"amount":355.94,"local_amount":1398800,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1422865.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542684232}],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T15:35:11Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T18:35:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maureen Wharton","image":null}},{"id":652003,"name":"Unity Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Unity Group consists of six ladies and two gentlemen.

As such, she's requesting a loan to stock up on clothing, which will help get her business up & running, give her family a stable source of income, and allow her to become a true businesswoman.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1515340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"stock up on clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Yavan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.313056 69.043056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-01-26T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-25T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safargul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":217.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":230.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":231.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":236.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":240.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":247.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":248.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":258.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":263.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":267.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":281.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":217.56,"local_amount":217.56,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":217.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459153187},{"amount":230.65,"local_amount":230.65,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":230.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467969356},{"amount":231.63,"local_amount":231.63,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":231.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479189649},{"amount":236.66,"local_amount":236.66,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":236.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490883052},{"amount":240.28,"local_amount":240.28,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":240.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504310094},{"amount":247.01,"local_amount":247.01,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":247.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517591900},{"amount":1596.21,"local_amount":1596.21,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1596.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530087540}],"funded_date":"2014-02-24T03:39:54Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:34:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":647006,"name":"Florencia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florencia helps her husband in managing their own farm for a living.

getting a clear source of income that he could use to provide for his children. He works six days a week and 10 hours a day. Sulait also does some coffee trade, which supplements his income. He goes to different locations and mainly to open markets and his clients are all categories of people. \r\n\r\nSulait would like to use this loan to buy bales of used shoes to provide additional stock for him. His main business challenge is lack of enough capital, but he is hopeful that this will be no more if he receives this loan since he will buy more stock and make more profits.

After almost 28 years of teaching and selling ready-to-wear products, Luz has gone through ups and downs in this business. A few months earlier, Luz stopped teaching at her private school due to the massive competition of daycare schools, where many of her students transferred to public schools. After deciding to shut down her private school, she decided to apply to a public school in front of their house as a Grade 2 teacher. Hoping to be accepted in the school next year, she is now relying on her income through her ready-to-wear products. With this business running over almost 28 years, she is very successful in this style. Luz is a member of Paglaum since 2008 and having loans to expand her business. With an estimated income of 10,000.00 pesos per month, she wants to expand her business slowly and to give inspiration to other entrepreneurs like

Elmira has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Elmira works with livestock breeding, after having started 7 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Elmira's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow, a calf and a horse. Elmira's husband is a shepherd, herding cattle for the local population for a fee.

His crops are approximately one kilometer away which he has to walk to, always with the help of his wife who supports him in some of the work with the products.

She has not lost hope of being able to retake her studies when she can afford them. She is married and her husband makes a living from bricklaying when construction work is underway, but otherwise he makes a living from farm work. Lidia has two children: the oldest (7 years old) is at school. Besides her children, she also looks after her nephew, who lives with her.\r\n\r\nApart from doing the household work, Lidia breeds hens, which she later sells when the prices are good. She also sells their eggs to neighbours.\r\nShe also helps her husband with the farm work; they grow corn, beans, and sorghum.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is for purchasing cement, sand, and wood for making improvements to her home, since her and her husband are building it a little at a time as they do not have sufficient economic resources. By making these improvements, they will be able to have decent living conditions for themselves and their children.\r\n\r\nHer dream, besides finishing her house, is to be able to take up her studies at university again, with the support of her husband and by investing in productive initiatives. For this reason she is making the most of some training she is receiving on baking. This will allow her to fund her studies without neglecting her home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1494682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

They travel to the business every day, without rest, as it is their main source of daily income.  The loan that he is requesting is to buy clothing of all different sizes and for both sexes, as he needs this in order to expand his small business and be able to earn more income and a better life for him, his wife, and his future child, who they work hard for each day to earn a daily income.

He is a family man, relying on them for support when he needs it, is energetic and motivated, and is in the process of opening his very own grocery store.  He's been interested in the grocery business for a while now, and is quite pleased that he'll finally be able to open a store of his own.  For years, Zahfarjon's been setting aside money to start up his business from farming and raising livestock.  He's already built the store itself and furnished it with shelves and two refrigerators.  Unfortunately, this is all he's been able to do thus far as his funds are limited; he still needs to stock his store with food products, and is requesting a loan of $2,900 (USD) to do so.   Zahfarjon hopes that Kiva will grant him the chance to open his own business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1515343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Gloria's husband no longer works due to his age.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn a living and because her husband cannot work, Gloria has a business raising chickens and pigs. Each season she has up to 30 pigs, whom she feeds for six to eight months, before selling to businesspeople who come to her home to buy the animals. They then take them to the city's and province's markets to sell. Gloria also grows achiote, which gives her very good profits. This work allows Gloria to earn a living to support her family.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy feed and medicines for the pigs.

Sabohat's husband goes to Russia as a migrant worker in order to provide for his family. The children are already grown-ups and help their mother with farming. \r\n\r\nSabohat works both with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding, like most of the residents in her region. She has been sowing crops and breeding cows and bull-calves for a period of 15 years. \r\n\r\nSabohat applied for a loan in order to purchase some cows and bull-calves for reselling. In the winter period the cost of cattle at the market is somewhat lower and due to this, Sabohat would like to increase the number of cattle in her cattle-yard. The loan will help her increase the family's budget and this way improve their well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1515779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase some cows and bull-calves to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-01-26T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-25T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabohat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":889},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":889},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":889},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":889},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":889},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":889},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":889},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":889},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":888}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":188.91,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490883054},{"amount":188.92,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504310096},{"amount":188.91,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517591902},{"amount":188.91,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530087542},{"amount":188.91,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542568711},{"amount":188.92,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561700714},{"amount":188.91,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":901.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579637351},{"amount":185.45,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":901.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.46,"payment_id":595213985},{"amount":183.66,"local_amount":888,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":900.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.04,"payment_id":610609413}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T02:30:33Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:26:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":651487,"name":"Inmaculada Concepcion Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Inmaculada Concepcion est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 2 del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, donde todas trabajan y se ayudan por salir adelante, se pusieron como objetivo el poder ayudarse las unas a las otras.

He was not in a position to study due to the financial situation of his family. Mamatali lived with his mother and two sisters, so he had to work all day in order to feed his family. Currently he lives separately from his mother. \r\n\r\nMamatali works with cattle breeding. He has worked with this type of business for many years already. His wife is a housewife. She also does not have an education, but helps her husband breed the cattle. Mamatali gets up early every day in order to milk his cows, and his wife produces dairy products. They sell the dairy products to their friends and neighbors. They spend the income from the sale of milk on the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCurrently Mamatali would like to increase the number of cattle and expand his business.

and raising three children together with her husband. Rakhat has secondary education. She works as a paid cleaner at the local school, however this income is not enough. Since 2001, as an additional income for her family, Rakhat has worked with livestock breeding as well, after purchasing livestock for 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Rakhat's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows and six sheep. The monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Rakhat turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase sheep to fatten and subsequently resell at the market at a higher price. Rakhat plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1515816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Adolat is a 58 years old widow with six children. She lives in the Hamadoni region with her five daughters and her son. Her husband is long dead and she provides for the family herself. Adolat has higher education. She worked as a director at a high school for a period of 15 years. The last 10 years she has been teaching at the same school. She loves her profession very much. \r\n\r\nHowever, currently the circumstances of life are such that her small pay and her son's pay is not enough for the family needs.

While she was studying law as an undergraduate, her friend asked Elyssa to attend massage school with her. Though Elyssa had little interest, she agreed out of loyalty to her friend. Elyssa was surprised when she fell in love with the craft and decided to pursue her newfound love.\r\n\r\nWhile working at a spa, Elyssa constantly had clients ask her about starting her own business because they loved her services. After working for someone else for years, she realized that there was no more room for growth within the company. She also wanted to be able to expand the services she provided her clients beyond the capacity of her employer, and started to develop a vision for a spa with uniquely client-centric services. \r\n\r\n\u201cFinding the courage within myself to leave a stable job where I was on top, and have security to start a business with the possibility of failing was the most challenging part of launching out,\u201d shared Elyssa. But with constant encouragement from her loyal clients, she finally decided to launch out.\r\n\r\nElyssa has just signed a lease for a space for a new wellness spa and studio offering comprehensive spa services, including massages and lash extensions. She already has a steady base of 60 clients, but is the sole employee of the spa. She will use her $2,700 Kiva loan to purchase equipment and products, giving her the jump-start she needs to launch her business and get it running successfully. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Elyssa wants to see her business grow and hire more employees, but ultimately she hopes to build an oasis where clients can come to rejuvenate both physically and emotionally and then take that out into the

They sew garments to order; there are many tailors working in the stitching center. Her husband teaches untrained workers, then gives them specific tasks for completion; in this way, he is discouraging unemployment as well. Her husband wants to buy a new sewing machine but he has already spent his savings on clothing, spools of thread, cloth, buttons and needles.\r\n\r\nDue to a lack of funds, however, she is unable to buy the new sewing machine. Therefore, Sofia contacted BRAC Pakistan for a loan so that her husband can buy an additional sewing machine for the stitching center.

Her mother is deceased and she helps her siblings. It is very hard for her because she has to pay rent, utilities, and it isn't enough. She lives with an aunt and would very much appreciate any help Kiva lenders can offer. \r\n\r\nThank you."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1500891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her education.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-12-27T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-25T23:00:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-21T09:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":152290.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":450392886},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":152290.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069567},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":152290.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882510},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":152290.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201874},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":304580.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286015}],"funded_date":"2013-12-28T00:21:34Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":652102,"name":"Sosefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sosefina is 25 years old and married with one child. \r\n\r\nShe owns and operates a small store, selling items such as snacks, freezer goods, and groceries.

He decided not to continue in school because he lacked financial resources, so 14 years ago he started working making hammocks.  He is married, and his wife and children also help him with the weaving.  He has 6 children, 2 of whom are in school, and one who is working with another craftsman.

He did not have the opportunity to go to school because his mother was raising four more children besides himself, and it was thus that he learned to work in different areas where he obtained income to raise the family.\r\n\r\nHis wife is the one who cares for the home and their children while he works every day of the week as a plumber for the town government. His children are still young and are not going to school to attend classes.\r\n\r\nDuglas has worked as a plumber since 2006, and every day at 2 in the morning he goes to open the water tap to stock the water for the district, and this is how he earns his living, to give his children a better life. He has to walk for more than 30 minutes on paths in the mountains to arrive at his work. For a long time he worked making knives and machetes, work that his uncle taught him when he was very young, and this was how he grew up for his whole life. He also learned masonry as a youth, since his father abandoned them and it was necessary that he learn various trades. Duglas is a hard worker. When he has free time, he works in agriculture (he plants corn, beans, and sorghum).\r\n\r\nDuglas is applying for a loan from CrediCampo to buy 500 blocks and cement to construct part of his house, since it is urgent, because in the winter the house is flooded and it is necessary to make the improvement in the house, which he will do. He already has part of the iron, stone, and sand. With this repair, Duglas will have more security for his family and they won't have times of hardship in the house when winter arrives. \r\n\r\nDuglas dreams of giving his children the education that he didn't have in his youth. The loan will be very useful since there is a need to make improvements in his home. Little by little he will improve his home until his entire house is made of cement blocks, since now it is made of metal sheets, and with the loan he will repair only the part that gets wet.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1516264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy 500 blocks and cement to construct part of his house; it is urgent because in the winter it is flooded with water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-27T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-26T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Duglas Yovani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.83,"local_amount":79.83,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":79.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088588},{"amount":80.4,"local_amount":80.4,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":80.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902847},{"amount":85.07,"local_amount":85.07,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216037},{"amount":85.6,"local_amount":85.6,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":85.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817394},{"amount":88.94,"local_amount":88.94,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":88.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242849},{"amount":80.16,"local_amount":80.16,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":80.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525932}],"funded_date":"2014-01-27T03:45:24Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":661960,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanita is married with six children.

She became a member last January 2013 and has taken out two loans. \r\n\r\nNow, Ruchel is applying for 14,000 PHP to buy additional inventory for her sari-sari store business, particularly basic commodities.  In the future, she wants to own a mini-mart and will be fully satisfied if she sees her children finish their studies. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1517967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional inventory for her sari-sari store business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Molave -

She did not go to school. She married three years ago in her community, but she has lived with her partner for more than 30 years. Her and her husband have 11 children,  5 sons and 6 daughters who always work together as a family to get ahead and  to obtain a better quality of life. Her husband works in agriculture (he plants corn, beans and sorghum). Six children and three grandchildren live in their home who Maria and her husband care for. The older children have their own families, but they are always close by. Four of their children are currently studying in the nearest community which is a 45 minute walk away to get to the school where they attend classes during the week. \r\n\r\nMaria works making hammocks. When she was 9 years old her mother taught her this artisanal trade. From this day on she continued to make hammocks for children and for people of all ages. She makes them out of silk and poliseda because they are profitable. She purchases the materials from the nearest city. To get there she has to walk for 30 minutes to take the municipal bus which takes another 30 minutes to arrive at the city. Her husband and her children accompany her to purchase the materials. She makes 4 hammocks per week with the help of her husband and her children. She leaves to sell them in the city every 15 to 22 days because they sell for a good price at the market. She also makes hammocks for special orders. Maria works during the entire day from six in the morning through to the night. The loan she is seeking is for the purchase of 200 pounds of silk which costs $4.50 per pound. With this silk she will have primary materials for 40 hammocks made from poliseda that she will sell for a good price to obtain earnings that will allow her to provide sustenance for her family. Maria's dream is to purchase a mill for grinding corn in town in order to have another source of income because in the area where they live there is no mill. Also, with the earnings from her sales she wants to continue assisting her children with their studies so they can succeed.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.<br \/><br \/>She is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to expand her product inventory, including groceries, toiletries, and beverages.<br \/><br \/>Lilia dreams that her variety store will become a grocery store and hopes that her family is always in good condition.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week.  This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His name is Barodboy, he is 54 years old, and is married. His wife grows agricultural crops, and his children are grown up. Barodboy is also raising two young grandchildren. <br \/><br \/>Since he lives in a rural area, Barodboy has a good chance of growing his cattle breeding business. He has been raising cattle for over 25 years and has a lot of experience in this sector. Thanks to the good condition of his cattle, he has regular customers.

His wife, Gulnora, is the one who mostly helps him with growing produce. This is the third time that Saidmurod is turning to our organization. He launched his business by having two heads of small livestock, and now he has four heads of cattle. He fattens cattle for resale to butchers. He uses the revenue from this business to support his family and improve their living conditions. Saidmurod would like to replenish his working capital, which is why he is applying for a loan in the amount of 12,000 TJS to buy cattle. He is counting on your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1516756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is the featured borrower member for Esther Group and she is pictured with her hand raised.\n\nHechong opens the shop early in the morning and usually closes down before the sunset. Her business peak time is early morning and at noon time. Her tea stall is a success and she is earning well. The generated income is insufficient for the family as she also takes care of her husband's nieces and nephew who were unfortunately abandoned by their father.\n  \nShe is striving hard together with her husband to manage the family expenses and also to stand as a financially independent woman.\n\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more sacks of flour and wheat, and also juices and cold drinks to sell. The burden of rolling out the capital money for investment has been fulfilled by Kiva and she is very glad. Earlier, she used to get capital money from local money investors with high interest rates. \n\nShe says she will try her best to expand the shop and make more income to support the family and give good education for the children.\n\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in poultry, weaving, selling  garments, and running a tea stall.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1498550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more sacks of flour and wheat, and also juices and cold drinks for the tea stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-12-28T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-26T05:20:03Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"T.lewish","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenghat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemjanei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoinu L.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neihmunchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikipnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hechong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":180000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-04T18:54:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":651526,"name":"Ismael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ismael es originario de la ciudad de Wiwili, Jinotega.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaxima operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and foods cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippine Pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken, and vegetables, and products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nMaxima hopes to expand her business and dreams to have a good life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT (Center for Community Transformation) community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He learned the trade of hammock making from his wife.  She taught him the art of the silk thread and nowadays, also poly silk.  Thanks to his perseverance and effort he has been making hammocks since then to sell in the city or he also works by custom order.  He makes 4 to 5 hammocks per week with his wife and children.  \r\nJos\u00e9 worked in agriculture growing corn, beans, and sorghum.  With the help of his children he takes care of his corn and bean fields for his family's consumption.    \r\nHe buys the materials for making the hammocks at the closest city by taking 2 urban transit buses which takes him half an hour.  He goes with his wife since they already have a place where they always buy the raw materials to later make the hammocks.  He buys the materials every 8 to 15 days depending on how the business is going.  \r\nHe is requesting a loan from CrediCampo to buy wood, tiles, sheets, and rods to make improvements to his house because last winter he had problems with water getting into his home and he needs to make repairs and at the same time change the wood on the roof.  He will also buy 100 pounds of silk thread valued at $400 to keep making his hammocks of silk and poly silk. \r\nWith this credit he will have a safer house where to live with his family and work on the hammocks in a better environment.  In addition, he will have the material to make the hammocks and hence have more income to allow him to give his family a better quality of life.  \r\nJose's dream is to make his own brick house in the future for his family.  This loan will be very helpful because the earnings from the sale of the hammocks will help him for the agriculture work that is approaching.

He continues with this business.\n\nNow Davit asks his third Kiva loan in an amount of 1,100,000 Armenian drams again to buy several gas cylinders and some needed materials for his work. This will be his third loan from Kiva, and he greatly needs it.\n\nDavit says all the income from his work he spends for the needs of his young family.

His family includes his parents, wife, two daughters and a son. Jambuli's father works at a petrol station and generates 400 GEL monthly. The borrower is also employed. He is an artisan and gets private orders. Jambuli's average income is 200 GEL per month. His salary, however, is not enough to meet the basic needs of the family. Jambuli has a great desire to start a stable business that will take care of his family's everyday needs. He requested 3,000 GEL to open a general store at his house. He has already built the interior of this store and needs money to purchase a wide range of products. His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. This money will also be a great help to his hard-working wife, who will be the sales clerk in the store and have her own activity. Jambuli relies on the goodwill of the lenders and will highly appreciate their support.

Merabi is a taxi driver; he serves the local people and generates 300-350 GEL per month. Despite this compensation, it's hard to support 4 family members with this income. So, he decided to start a clothing trading business with the loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Merabi received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo - Start up Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of 1,500 USD, he will purchase clothing and other home products at a wholesale price and sell them in Senaki's agricultural market area. He plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women and children. Merabi is a hard-working and motivated person and the Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased.

His father taught him how to farm the land and grow basic grains.  And from his father he received land to cultivate so he could earn an income to support his family.  His wife also runs a small grocery store for extra income.\r\n\r\nWilliam says the community does not have electricity so they use candles at home.
