Starting a new life after the ethnic clashes was not easy; financial insecurity paralysed their life. Her husband and she have geared up together to start a new beginning and work very hard, encouraging one another.\r\n\r\nHatneithem is a weaver. She weaves different designs of woven clothes for both women and men. At the beginning, she used to ask the customers to bring their own yarn\/thread for weaving, and she usually gets paid for the labour charge only. She did not have the option to purchase yarns and thread for the customers as she did not have financial resources. After she joined the Lungset group, Hatneithem was able to purchase her choice of yarn and thread and makes more profit than before. The generated income is meager and is insufficient to manage the family expenses. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Hatneithem will purchase yarn and thread to stock and start weaving. With sufficient supply of yarns and thread, one can manage to weave, making woven clothes for both men and women, which is a very good source to generate income. Hatneithem is glad that, with the help of the loan, she will be able to continue the weaving business and also manage the family financial expenses with the generated income. Her only wish is to give good education to her kids so they will be able to stand on their own feet and become successful academically.\r\n\r\nHatneithem says \u201cThank you, Kiva!\u201d The support and unending co-operation is hoped for and the group will also abide and practice the good message that Kiva is doing.

He still has energy and the motivation to keep fighting for his family's well-being. He is currently working as a grass cutter, offering his services in the various estates around his town. He learned this work on the job and has now been doing it for eight years. He also earns an income from making and selling women's sandals, a trade he learned from a friend. Luis splits his time between these two jobs, cutting grass in the mornings, and producing sandals from the comfort of his home in the afternoons and evenings. Luis makes the sandals using crochet, and with materials such as cork and synthetic materials. He has his own designs, which have been well-received by local woman. With these jobs, Luis earns a living and supports his wife and two children.\r\n\r\nLuis will use this loan to buy supplies (threads, crochet needles, cork, synthetic materials) in bulk and to carry out maintenance on his lawn mower. This will allow him to create new designs which will satisfy his customers' tastes. He can also offer better service to the region's land owns and increase his income from this work.\r\n\r\nLuis tells us that his ever-advancing age is not stopping him from fighting for his dreams. He consequently continues to work so that, in the near future, he will be able to buy another lawn mower and provide jobs to others. He also wants to open a small shop to display his sandals. This would make sales easier and Luis would be able to improve his family's quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1518328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married and has 3 children whom she strives tirelessly for. She currently makes a living from sewing, supplying third parties. She learnt the trade from a training course which she received and she then gained experience and increased her knowledge whilst working as a machine operator in a sewing company, where she worked for 4 years. After this she took the initiative to branch out on her own as she needed to spend more time with her children and improve the family's income. This led her to set up her own workshop where she works from Monday to Saturday from 8am to 6pm. By doing this she generates enough income to help her husband with the financial responsibility for the household. \r\n\r\nThe loan requested will be used to buy a motorbike, which will make it easier for her to transport her finished products. Her customers don't travel to the area where she lives because of the frequent conflicts which occur between the various criminal gangs there. This means she has to transport the items herself, so she doesn't lose the customer contracts.\r\n\r\nYudy says that in spite of the various challenges she faces, she will continue to strive towards fulfilling her goals. In particular she wants to have a bigger workshop in a quieter area, where she can offer employment opportunities to mothers who are head of the household. Thus she will improve her family's quality of life and make a contribution towards better wellbeing for other people

Sustaining a family with a meager source of income is undeniably difficult for everyone, but it is harder for Lhingneichong, whose work site is about 5 kms away from the village. She walks at the break of the dawn to collect charcoal and comes back the same 5 kms route to the village and boards a mini truck with the charcoal at the top of the mini truck to the town market to sell it. She is the featured borrower member for Lily Lom and she is pictured with her hand raised.\r\n\r\nThe group comprises five hardworking women who all reside in a village that is about 15 kms far from the town. The town is 62 kms from the capital town of Imphal. The group members usually contribute equal shares and take land from the village chief on rent for a period of one year so that they can cut down firewood and burn it for charcoal. When the charcoal is ready to be sold, she walks everyday at the break of the dawn to collect the charcoal from the burial sites and carries the charcoal sack on her back and walks back to the village. Only once or twice do vehicles ply that route. If one gets lucky, then one gets a ride or else walking is the only option. From the village, she travels to the town market with the charcoal and sells it.\r\n\t\r\nWith the KIva loan, she will contribute a share for taking the land on rent and start burning charcoal. She is sure to earn a good amount of money since charcoal is in great demand during winter season and the price also is high unlike in off seasons. She says she will also be able to pay new admissions for the children without worrying where to get the money as she could sell her charcoal like hot cakes in this season. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to purchase a used mini truck so that it can be used as a carrier for charcoal and also as a passenger carrier. She thanked Kiva and hopes it will continue cooperation with WSDS and make their lives happy ones.  She is also glad for the support and believes that this may bring a success in life. She says, \u201cThank you, Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in charcoal business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1502256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a portion of land on rent, cut woods and burn charcoal for selling to support the family and kids education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-12-28T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-26T16:20:05Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damneihkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tainu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Tinkhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T18:46:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":662168,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a 30-year-old married man from a small village near Jenin city.

Karima's husband provides a service of constructing and refurbishing houses in the villages and districts. Karima is engaged in trade. She buys in bulk dry dairy products ( kurut ) and sells at a price premium. In Tajikistan, there is such a product called \"kurut.\" They are small and white balls that you see in the pictures. Kurut is produced by the withdrawal of moisture condensed milk mass \"katyk.\" In order to do this, a bag with \"katyk\" is suspended in the shade and moisture flows through the tissue within a few days. That is how the nutritious dense mass is developed. Then salt is added, and then from this the mass is hands rolled into balls with a diameter of 1-5 cm. These balls are dried in the sun for several days, sometimes brought to the steadfast state. They are used as crackers or soaked and used as a soup.\n\n<br \/><br \/>Karima works with retail. She purchases dairy products and resells them at a higher price. She has worked with this activity for a period of four years. Karima needs a loan to continue her retail business. For the loan amount, she would like to purchase dairy products for resale.

She is a mother of four, and lives in the same compound with her mother-in-law and her co-wife with her two children. Gladys is employed in a tea factory on a six-month contract while her husband is a farmer in their 2-acre farm. Her family has been using the traditional kerosene for lighting and cooking for many years. Every month the three houses use approximately 12 liters of kerosene.  \r\n\r\nAfter visiting their factory with a display of different solar lamps, Gladys was very impressed and decided to approach VEP for a credit to buy three solar packages that could serve her, her mother-in-law and her co-wife who would then assist her repay the loan. The solar package has the advantage of lighting four rooms, charging a mobile phone and powering a small radio. Her mother-in-law who has a two-roomed house would have her extra two bulbs lighting the compound, especially when they are needed to use the pit latrine at night.  The solar lamps will help Gladys save a lot of money used on kerosene for lighting, enhance their security by minimizing fire accidents, and improve their health by reducing eye and lung irritation from smoke.\r\n\r\nIn future Gladys also hopes to  buy an efficient charcoal cookstove that would help her switch from their kerosene stove to a cleaner charcoal stove.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":459.38,"image":{"id":1518887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

The city is known for its beautiful beaches which people go to year-round, and also for its unparalleled beauty and many tourist attractions. These people decided to get together some time ago and formed this credit group which has been very helpful in growing their businesses. They do various kinds of work but almost all engage in informal commerce. \r\n\r\nManuel is a member of this group.  He is 61 years old, divorced but has six grown children from that relationship. One of his children lives with him together with his family.  As he is engaged, his fiancee her small children live with them. Manuel has worked all his life so that his family would not lack for anything.  He sells fish and has a rented stand in a local market where he has worked every day for more than 30 years. He opens his stall at the crack of dawn to take delivery from his vendors of the best fish.  He then sells to his customers. He mostly sells fish by the pound such as bicuda, albacore tuna,  bonito, and others.

There are several places from where to enjoy nature and it is bathed by four rivers.\r\n\r\nRuth is one of the members.  She has been an active member of the La Florida group for two years and has developed a good friendship over the years.  She likes the loans because they help grow their businesses.\r\n\r\nRuth is 50 years old, in a common law marriage and has two married adult children.  Her son lives in his own home and her married daughter lives with her and helps with the expenses.  Her husband is a private employee.  She owns her house.\r\n\r\nRuth takes care of the domestic chores and cares for her grandchildren.  She also sells food and works from Monday through Friday, without a fixed schedule, so she can be financially independent.  She will use the money from this loan to buy ingredients with which to prepare her products.  Her goal is to grow her business more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1518602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-01-27T21:30:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-26T21:30:32Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Lastenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Angelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Angelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janneth Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1771.29,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":177.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":177.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":355,"local_amount":354.26,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":355,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459103041},{"amount":355,"local_amount":354.26,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":355,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467917919},{"amount":532.51,"local_amount":531.39,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":532.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138737},{"amount":355,"local_amount":354.26,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":355,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832649},{"amount":177.49,"local_amount":177.12,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":177.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258731}],"funded_date":"2014-01-28T02:25:02Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Her eldest daughter is married and the three younger children are still school-aged.  Aiymsuluu has a high school education and she grows crops as the main source of income for her family.  She started in this line of work 18 years ago with the sum of 5,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, she now has .17 hectares of land on which she grows potatoes and vegetables for her own family's consumption and for retail sale.<br \/><br \/>Aiymsuluu's husband is a migrant worker in Russia who makes his living in construction.

She comes from Leon, which is in the west of the country. She is responsible, hard-working and has a desire to improve herself. In her free time she likes to enjoy the company of her children. Unfortunately, she was not able to study for a degree because of lack of funds, and so she had to work from a young age to help out with the household's costs. Thanks to her effort and her desire to get on in life, she works at making slabs and cement tombstones for cemetery graves.

She is married and has two children, who she has moved forward with her hard work.<br \/><br \/>From a young age, she learned farming skills since this is a family tradition passed down from generation to generation. Because of this, she now has an independent business as a milk producer. She owns 10 cows who she milks daily. The milk they produce is sold to a neighbor who has refrigerated tanks and to stores and cafes in town. This earns income to support her husband and pay family expenses.<br \/><br \/>Sandra is known for her drive, her perseverance, and her constant hard work. She has overcome obstacles from farming supplies and the unstable prices of the product she sells. However, she's been able to handle these difficult situations and move forward, motivated by her family's love.<br \/><br \/>She is currently requesting a loan to buy a cow for milking, which will replace one that is pregnant and doesn't produce as much milk. This will allow her to fulfill her contracts and improve her sales and income. This will allow her to keep working to strengthen her business. Sandra plans to grow her production capacity with more animals in the near future. Then she will be able to continue helping her family and bring them a better quality of

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

Chichicastenango, ten motivated women organized themselves into the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cEsperanza de Chipaca 1\u201d. Their average age is 34 years and almost none of them have attended school. The women are weavers and mostly work in textile production. They create beautiful handmade textiles like the ornate Guatemalan blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d (pronounced \u201cwee-pee-les\u201d), shawls, tablecloths and centerpieces. Generally, the women have large families and so it is essential that they look for ways to generate income to support their basic needs. The group recently welcomed three new members who are most excited about the possibility of a loan. They share this feeling with the other ladies in the Trust Bank who are all seeking ways to progress with this vital working capital provided by Friendship Bridge. The women will use the funds to invest in their businesses in order to maintain or expand them.\r\n\r\nElvira is one of the newest members of \u201cEsperanza de Chipaca 1\u201d and joined the group seeking a funding source to invest in her businesses and earn extra income. She is 26 years of age, married and has two young children. She needs to purchase additional materials for the production of textiles which is one of her businesses. Elvira also has a small orchard where she grows apples and peaches, which is typical of the area where she lives. She needs to purchase fertilizer at this time of year for maximum fruit production. Along with her husband, Elvira understands the importance of a good education for the children so that they can enjoy a more prosperous future for themselves and their future families.\r\n\r\nElvira is one of the few members of the Trust Bank who attended school. She had four years of formal education and longs to learn new things. Friendship Bridge offers monthly trainings at the meetings of each Trust Bank. The Friendship Bridge concept of microloans combined with educational trainings is called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. The trainings cover various subjects like business administration and indebtedness, health and hygiene as well as women\u2019s rights and self-esteem. The women form a strong bond with each other and learn about their identity as women and experience opportunities for leadership in the group.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the \u201cEsperanza de Chipaca1\u201d Trust Bank look forward to this new loan cycle and the new opportunities and possibilities that are ahead in their lives. They are most appreciative to Kiva investors for believing in them. Armed with loans and education, they face a brighter tomorrow as empowered women eliminating poverty!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3525,"image":{"id":1519139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married and has 4 children aged 24, 21, 17 and 15. In 1997, Kabbah established his Muslim caps and beads business. He began his business just to enable him to settle his domestic problems. His business is located in the city center and his main customers are Muslim men and women. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 650,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000.

She and her late husband have raised 14 children (nine sons and five daughters).  She was awarded the honorary title of \"Mother Heroine\" and also recognized as an \"Honored Worker\" of her village.  She has a secondary education.  After finishing school, she worked on a kolkhoz (collective farm) and then got married to a man named Juman who gave her 14 children.  Juman became ill and died in 1999.  Before his illness he worked as a shepherd in the village.  Out of the couple's 14 children, 12 are now married and living independently, while the two youngest sons  still live with their mother.\r\n\r\nKarayakhan is now enjoying retirement, but she is still involved in agriculture and helping her children.  All her adult life, Karayakhan has been raising cattle and growing crops.  She started in this field 40 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 1,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she now owns one dairy cow, one calf and one horse and, together with her children, she cultivates 4.48 hectares of land and grows beans annually.  She makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, Karayakhan has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" to buy some cows and increase her cattle headcount.  She plans to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her number of farm animals.  She is also planning to save enough money to pay for her son's wedding ceremony.\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1517280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chon-Karabuura village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-28T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-27T03:50:06Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":57.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karayakhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":115000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":480.46,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":25158.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.54,"payment_id":579488819},{"amount":462.04,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":25158.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":37.96,"payment_id":595436028}],"funded_date":"2014-02-01T13:03:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":662648,"name":"Anelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anelia is 38 years old and married with three children She runs a small sari-sari store business located in Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte, Philippines.
