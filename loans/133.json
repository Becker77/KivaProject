At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAvelina operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. \r\n\r\nAside from this, she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 16, 000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAvelina hopes to have her house renovated and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":873282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

T.. Magret was born in Bafodia, about eighteen miles from Kabala. She is twenty-eight years old. She is married to a teacher. They have four children together. Magret sells cotton and ground-nuts. She has been in this business for six years. Magret is requesting a loan of Le 2,000,000. This will be her very first loan from SMT. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Magret will expand her business by buying more goods to add to her current stock. She will use the loan to buy cotton and ground-nuts. She will also use some of the loan for transportation and other expenses relating to her business. \r\n\r\nShe buys the ground-nuts from a make-shift business center, or \u201cluma,\u201d called Bamoi, about 160 miles round-trip from Makeni. She buys the cotton from Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s capital city, a 390 mile round trip from Makeni. A bag of ground-nuts costs her Le 180,000 at Bamoi, and a piece of cotton costs her Le 25,000 in Freetown. She estimates that she\u2019ll be able to get a least five bags of ground-nuts and thirty-six pieces of cotton with the loan. \r\n\r\nAlthough her business is doing well for Magret on the whole, she does, face one great challenge: bad debtors.

She hopes to improve her quality of life in order to provide her children with a good education. She leaves the house early to sell her delicious breads, walking with her inseparable tricycle cart on the streets of the city of Juliaca, hoping to find customers. The breads Octavia sells are made by her husband, who patiently bakes them at 3:00 in the morning to give to his wife to sell. What Octavia loves most about her work is that she can savor the bread her husband bakes and avoid hunger. She has spent 8 years doing this and longs for her own store where she can sell her bread comfortably since the most difficult part of her job is braving the intense cold in the morning, which has often made her sick. This is Octavia's second loan with MFP and she is very grateful; she used the first loan to finish building an oven. She will pay her loan back on time to avoid hurting her local bank.

Se dedica a la venta de comida en un local ubicado en la avenida principal de su localidad, aunque al principio tuvo temores por su falta de experiencia en la preparaci\u00f3n de los platillos, su gran habilidad y deliciosa saz\u00f3n le facilitaron desenvolverse en su negocio. Lidia tiene un socio, con quien trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las 11 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta la media noche, ya que las personas suelen salir con sus familias a degustar de una deliciosa cena en las avenidas principales.

This is their fourth successful year of operation! The hours of their restaurant require that they start early in the morning and work until late in the night every day of the week, oftentimes until the food runs out or the last customer is fed. They employ four people as helpers.\r\n\r\nFelex and his group members have been in business since 2006 and they are ready to expand, but their operating profit is still too low for them to make some key purchases to enable the expansion. For this reason, they are requesting their first loan from Vision Finance Company and Kiva lenders. With the loan, the group will be able to afford to buy modern cooking equipment and quality foods and supplies to satisfy their loyal customers. This effort will also help them to attract more customers as well as increase their monthly sales and profit.\r\n\r\nWith this profit, they all pledge to continue to reinvest in the business, pay school fees for their children, and build more secure futures for themselves and their families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":430348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase modern cooking equipment and quality supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Byumba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chartine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":660000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110000},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782269},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169371},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008362},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037592},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760261},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":110792.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022695}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T14:45:39Z","paid_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":160423,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucy es comerciante de todo tipo de peluches, que comercializa en la feria 16 de  julio de la ciudad de El Alto; el esposo trabaja como transportista, estas actividades son sus principales fuentes de ingreso con que cubren la manutenci\u00f3n de dos peque\u00f1os hijos que de pende de la pareja.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gravito is 46 years old and lives in the Recreo neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  His business is the production of snacks and pastries. \r\n\r\nHe started his career as a soccer coach, but he lost his job and needed to earn some income, so he started a bakery (just selling bread) with his savings and took a course at the Sena School to learn this trade.  This business was not going well \u2013 he has some problems with liquidity \u2013 so he sought advice from the Sena School and signed up for a class on pastries.  He has been selling pastries for 5 years, and this business now allows him to earn a living; he continues to expand his diverse product line.  At first he was very nervous, because his family doubted the success of the business, but he received a lot of support anyway.  With this business, he has been able to improve his family's quality of life.  He currently has a large, independent shop and he also caters at reception halls.\r\n\r\nWhile running this business, he also offers consulting services and technical courses on pastry-making to small businesses or entrepreneurs who would like to learn these skills.  His greatest challenge is that he does not have enough working capital to expand his operations and commercialize his products within the corporate sector.  With this goal, he is seeking a loan of  $1,000,000 (Columbian) in order to buy a larger inventory of ingredients and raw materials.   His dream is to have a gourmet-style restaurant, but still faces this great challenge of insufficient working capital to expand.  He is very happy to have been chosen to participate in the Desarrollo Productivo (DIP) program because of the quality of its loan products.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":489166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy raw materials and ingredients for his pastry-making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T22:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime Alonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74211},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75757},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77335},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78946},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80591},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82270},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83984},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85733},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":87520},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89343},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91204},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":93106}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":74211,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":75338.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949053},{"amount":39.77,"local_amount":75757,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":76908.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712217},{"amount":90.3,"local_amount":172005,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":174618.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636045},{"amount":45.04,"local_amount":85783,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":87086.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850145},{"amount":32.21,"local_amount":61354,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":62286.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550435},{"amount":181.96,"local_amount":346580,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":351846.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688045},{"amount":47.88,"local_amount":91204,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":92589.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427287},{"amount":48.88,"local_amount":93106,"processed_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":94520.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000704}],"funded_date":"2010-02-18T23:52:41Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Kastner","image":343837}},{"id":181424,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdes C. is from the village of Catarman, Camiguin Province.

She has three years of experience in this business.    Sapani needs a loan of 2,000 WST to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or about $250 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nSapani joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Sapani's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She lives in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Nora is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase fish, feed for her pigs and stock for the store.  This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nora aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.

While attending to her husband and daughter, Carolina also keeps busy with her business as her way of helping her husband with the family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nCarolina owns a variety store. She buys groceries such as canned goods, condiments, milk, sugar and primary commodities needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day. Her husband\u2019s income in his tricycle business is also a big help. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Carolina is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan, which she will use to buy more grocery items to increase her stock. The more items displayed at the store the better, as it helps to attract more customers to buy from her. More sales will result in better profit and will help her to save more money for her future. \r\n\r\nCarolina hopes that her business will maintain good income and become a grocery someday. It would also be a great help to have an additional tricycle.  Carolina dreams of maintaining enough income to send her daughter to a good school and for her to be able to finish college, have work and a stable life. Carolina is active in attending the weekly fellowship* as it helps to learn a lot from the Bible. Before becoming a member of CCT, Carolina never opened her Bible, but she does now as it strengthens her spiritual life.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been able to accomplish one of her objectives by stocking up her convenience store and investing in the purchase of new clothing for resale.  Her sales have improved, as she was able to invest in a variety of products which were much needed by her influx of customers.  Her sales have become more steady and her income has improved, even in spite of the increase in prices which she is constantly facing.  However, even as the business has been going well, she can see other good changes.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a second loan to invest in clothing, as the December holidays are approaching when her sales increase significantly.  She also wants to offer a variety of products for sale in her convenience store: foods to prepare for Christmas dinner, pi\u00f1atas for the children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 39 years old. Joyce is married and has three school-age children. To make a living, Joyce owns and operates a sari-sari, or general store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Joyce has been in business for over four years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Joyce joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joyce has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Joyce is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Joyce from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own home with her 4 loving children and what she wishes for most is to give them a better quality of life. In the green fields of the Zona Patria town (District province of Chanchamayo), Lucia has her coffee crops.  Every morning despite weather conditions she takes care of her plants since it is the only source of income for her family.  What she enjoys most is working her land and she does it very carefully.  Lucia has 25 years of experience and considers that the most difficult part is protecting the crops from plagues since they hurt production.  In the future, she hopes to buy more land to increase production.  This is her sixth loan with MFP (Kiva\u2019s field partner) and is saving to pay her quotas on time since she does not want to cause problems to the other members of her communal bank, where she is very happy.  With the 1,500 nuevos soles, she will buy more fertilizers to protect her crops. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":559376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertlizers to protect her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1554.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588324}],"funded_date":"2010-07-03T04:19:28Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":214325,"name":"Parveen Akhtar's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parveen akhtar lives in the small city of Chichawatni Pakistan. \r\nShe is the mother of five children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Ana has worked with CEPRODEL for 2 years. She feels very satisfied with the loans she has received, since they have been provided to her at the ideal moment, helping her to restock her business and satisfy her clients every day. She has a record of 10 loans.<p><p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAna Patricia C. A., es una joven casada y con 3 hijos en edad escolar.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It\u2019s been difficult to produce greater quantities of bread because she has used the earnings so now there is no working capital to cover the production.  She started the business as an income source when she and her husband were unemployed.  They knew how to bake bread so they had the basis to open a bakery.  She needs the loan for a building that will be separate from the house so that it will be more practical.

She is separated from her husband and lives with her mother and 2-year old son.  She operates a snacks business in a space just outside her mother's front door.  She started the business a year ago with money she borrowed from her sister.  She and her mother also sell prepared meals.  They have a purpose-built stand in front of the house from which they sell the meals and they set up a grill on Sundays to make and sell grilled chicken.  That business has been up and running for 5 years.  Morayma likes the business because it gives her something to do and brings in the income she needs to support her son.  The hardest thing about the business, she says, is getting up at dawn to organize the day's work.  She's not complaining, though, because she sees that her income has grown along with her efforts and she wants to continue the business and grow it.  She wants to sell soft drinks with the snacks she sells and she needs a refrigerator to start.  This will be her second MFP loan and she tells us that she is grateful for the help she's received to grow her business.  She likes her community bank, too, and says that its members are responsible and supportive.  Morayma will use this 1000 new soles loan to buy wholesale supplies of soft drinks for her food business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":956320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock her food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-25T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Morayma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":108.79},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":115.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":112.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":124.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":128.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":129.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":138.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":142.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.8},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.8,"local_amount":108.79,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":109.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836379},{"amount":43.33,"local_amount":115.56,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":116.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246167},{"amount":42.19,"local_amount":112.49,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":113.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386183},{"amount":46.52,"local_amount":124.06,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":125.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099274},{"amount":48.25,"local_amount":128.68,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713424},{"amount":48.6,"local_amount":129.58,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":130.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202312},{"amount":51.86,"local_amount":138.31,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":139.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097993},{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":142.53,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":143.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400874}],"funded_date":"2011-12-25T19:22:02Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":382384,"name":"Dominador","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominador, who is 51 years old, lives with his partner.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns & operates a plantation and a vegetable garden.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Faafiapoto needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faafiapoto joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Faafiapoto's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nSPBD Social Metrics for this Borrower:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score*:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

M. is 53 years old and lives with her children and her husband in her own home in the new settlement Botijeria Angulo Sur, located in the Cercado de Ica area.  She runs her business out of this same home.  For over 10 years, she has worked selling traditional South American soups such as chainfaina and patasca.  When the earthquake hit, she had to have an operation, and was obliged to put her business aside for a moment, but today she once again maintains it. Her husband helps her with the business, since her 2 sons are professionals who are too busy to help with her business.  Se\u00f1ora Franisca has always helped her children, paying for all their education, always hoping to see them achieve more every day.\r\nSe\u00f1ora Francisca and her husband are good workers.  They hope for a loan so that they will be able to invest a little more in their business, purchasing sodas to sell in the summer, since they are very popular items during that time of year.  By doing this, Se\u00f1ora Francisca would earn more income from her business, permitting her to continue helping her children to strive for success. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marife has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 28,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, with which she intends to buy fresh fish to sell at a market so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Marife is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is married and has two children below 15 years of age. She lives in a seven bedroom apartment in Ntamulung, in Bamenda, Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. The major challenges she has faced in her life have been the lack of capital to start up her business, sicknesses in her family, the death of some close relatives like her elder sister and her aunts and uncles, and also when thieves broke into her house and made away with some of her valuables.\r\n\r\nShe joined Kiva's partner, GHAPE, in 2005 and has received and successfully repaid empowerment credits (ECs) four times. She invested her past ECs into frying and selling gateaux and also into poultry farming. She used the profits from these past loans to cater to her family, sponsor her children in school and to support her husband in the construction of their family house.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, she will stock up on red oil and vegetable oil, as well as buy fowls and pigs for her poultry and piggery. She strongly believes this business will be a success because she has so many customers already. This business activity will also be of great help to the community because it will increase the availability of ready-made food to the people in her area and their distance to the market will be reduced.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from this loan, she will be able to provide for her family, pay her children\u2019s school fees, and support her husband financially. She prefers a GHAPE loan because the interest rate is relatively lower and also because the monthly installment method of repayment is convenient to her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":893046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy oil, fowls and pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

She will be assisted by her son who has received some formal business training but is currently unemployed. She previously had a shop in Muhutini but closed it due to insecurity.

She sells the bottles to bottle-buying centers of appropriate factories or sometimes directly sells them to the factories. She typically will resell 5,000 to 6,000 bottles twice a month.\r\n\r\nShe makes a profit of between 20 to 50 per bottle (14,000 togrog=$1 USD).

He lives with his wife, Badamtsetseg, and 3-year-old daughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. They all live together in his father-in-law's house. Boldbayar currently operates a transportation business in the city using a van he owns. Every day, he makes ten trips between two transportation terminals in the city. His wife works along with him, collecting fares and announcing stops as he drives. They enjoy the work, however, his wife's voice is starting to tire after years of loudly announcing route stops.  Boldbayar started his business in 2006, after obtaining a loan to purchase his van. He has found much success as a driver, however, he recently had to purchase a bus as the city government plans to enact a law forbidding the use of vans for transportation in the city. He hopes to use future profits from the business to provide his family with their own house. He is requesting a  2,000,000 tugrug (~1,380 USD) loan to purchase a new van motor and four wheels to keep his van operating efficiently.

Dadajon is a 35-year-old married man who lives with his three children and owns a small farm. He lives and works in a small village in the Northern part of Tajikistan in Djabbar Rasulov region. Dadajon, together with his wife (pictured), have been running a business raising and selling cattle. He has 11 years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Dadajon has become a very successful businessman in a very short period. The income is enough to cover family needs but as his children grow, covering family needs has become harder. So Dadajon applied for a loan to expand his activities and to purchase more cattle. With your help, Dadajon can get ahead. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This group resides in the locality of Ribera Vista in the beautiful municipality of Copa\u00ednala, in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.  \r\n\r\nThe reason for the name of their group is that their group contains 3 women, and each one of them is a great star. \r\n\r\nAlba Ar\u00e9valo A. is married to Carlos P\u00e9rez Ju\u00e1rez; they have 5 children: 2 of whom are married, and 3 of whom are still dependent children.  These 3 are: Cintia Ver\u00f3nica, who is in a distance education program for secondary school, Carla Rafaela, who is in elementary school, and  Alexia Roxana, the youngest, who is 3 years old.\r\n\r\nAlba is a housewife who also has a small clothing business.  It has only been a few months since she started this business, and she requests a loan to stock the business with merchandise.  She comments that the business is going well, as it allows her to have some income for the household.  \r\n\r\nShe was inspired to start this activity by a cousin who lives nearby who motivated her to sell clothing, since it is a business where one can obtain good earnings.  With this business she will be able to earn her own money and pay for some of the daily household expenses and in this way support her husband, who works daily in agriculture.  \r\n\r\nShe will save some of the profits from her business to restock it with more merchandise and merchandise that is of better quality for her customers.  This way her customers will buy with greater enthusiasm and her income will be higher.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a clothing store where she can sell her merchandise.  In addition, she wants to save so that she can provide the best for her daughters who are still in school and, with the support of her husband, build a house where they can live better.\r\n\r\nShe formed this group with her daughter-in-law, who is in the purple blouse and recently had a baby, and a neighbor.  They found out about FRAC, and it seemed to them to be a source of support where they could work on their activities and obtain earnings while paying back the loans.  The members of this group are the following: Mar\u00eda Candelaria P\u00e9rez A., who will invest the loan in the purchase of ingredients such as corn flour, ancho chiles, meat and other items to make snacks; Mar\u00eda Candelaria P\u00e9rez A., who will invest the loan in the purchase of broilers to slaughter, season and sell; and Alba Ar\u00e9valo A., who will invest the loan in the purchase of clothing to sell such as: pants, shirts, T-shirts, skirts, blouses, and other items to sell in the same region."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":624488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing such as: pants, blouses, dresses, skirts and other items ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-11-04T18:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":3375,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3472.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554989},{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":3375,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3472.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691479},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2315.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430663}],"funded_date":"2010-11-05T08:01:34Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":247159,"name":"Maria Candelaria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, tiene 50 a\u00f1os D. edad, resiD. en Santa Elena departamento D.

She will use the amount requested to buy more snacks to have more variety available for her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":900676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more snacks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-21T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucerito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":92.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":91.1},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":99.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":106.76},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.68,"local_amount":92.48,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":94.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666682},{"amount":34.16,"local_amount":91.1,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":92.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621838},{"amount":18.73,"local_amount":49.95,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714214},{"amount":135.68,"local_amount":361.81,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":369.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203194},{"amount":1.75,"local_amount":4.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099079}],"funded_date":"2011-10-23T08:51:24Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":353735,"name":"Mkulima Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Mkulima SHG Group in Western Kenya! Erick is the facilitator of the Mkulima SHG group. Members of this group joined One Acre Fund in 2009 and 2010 and will re-enroll again in the 2012 program.\r\n\r\nErick is a father of three children. He joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough to feed the family, to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for his family. In the recent 2011 season, Erick had a very good maize yield harvesting 25 bags on 1 1\/2 acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Erick was only able to harvest 15 bags of maize on 1 1\/2 acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Erick and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from the maize sales, Erick will save for future use and ensure food security.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mkulima SHG group will each plant between \u00bd and 2 acres of maize.\r\n\r\nHe is pictured with the group members in the photograph above.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":925256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johnstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mediatrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronillah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":100800,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100860,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680580}],"funded_date":"2011-12-08T23:09:31Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}}]}
