was the word from Hatnem. She is the sole breadwinner in the family and a staunch believer in the divine. She is one of the members of the Sahei Lom Group and the featured borrower. She is pictured with her hand raised. Her husband manages the house and takes care of the family affairs.\r\n \r\nVegetable selling is her main business to generate income. She gets the vegetables from cultivators at cheaper rates and sells them in the nearby town market shed and once in a while, she also sells them in the capital market in Imphal. Her business requires frequent traveling since the suppliers stay in the village and she has to go there to get the vegetables. She sells vegetables according to the season, which helps to continue her rolling income. At the beginning, she used to share the profits because the capital money was equally distributed among the business partners. After she joined this group, she managed to start her own business, which enables her to earn more income.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase a variety of seeds to supply to as many cultivators as possible. She says cultivators favor those who can provide them seeds and saplings in bounty when they really need them because it is difficult for them to buy seeds and saplings due to a shortage of money. When the vegetables are ready to be sold, the cultivators give them priority in respect to distribution of the vegetables. They get more supplies than those random vegetable vendors who do not supply seeds at the beginning.\r\n\r\nShe is glad that she can fulfil her next business cycle without asking for money from the money lenders at a high interest. She will try her best to repay the loan as she always did with her previous loans. She says, \u201cThank you so much Kiva\u201d. She wishes to continue the relationship with Kiva and WSDS,  she says with full enthusiasm.\r\n \r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in garment selling, operating a tea hotel,  supplying water, operating a paan shop, selling vegetables, and operating a piggery.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1502589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a variety of seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-12-29T07:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-27T07:40:02Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pinky","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneivah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemtinlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hekim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":135000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T17:27:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":662268,"name":"Tiessiri Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe    TIESSIRI   est constitu\u00e9 de  5 femmes toutes mari\u00e9es ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 29ans et 3 enfants.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines fight off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfiinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1519509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay for the spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-01-28T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-27T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romeo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2718.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459307489},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2718.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467887999},{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2038.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479111240},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2718.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490806402}],"funded_date":"2014-01-28T08:45:13Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Courtney Henson","image":null}},{"id":646236,"name":"El Taller Del Maestro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo lo forman tres socias trabajadoras una de ellas es Blanca tiene la edad de 21 a\u00f1os, casada, con un hijo, su negocio es un taller de zapater\u00eda que tiene desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, comercializa sus sandalias en Rivas.

gesti\u00f3n de bienestar de su hogar, hasta ese momento solo en manos de su c\u00f3nyuge, quien hab\u00eda perdido su trabajo, Luz Estela, mujer de 36 a\u00f1os y madre de 2 hijos en las edades de 10 y 15 a\u00f1os, decidi\u00f3 aprovechar todo el conocimiento de panader\u00eda, que por herencia tenia su c\u00f3nyuge y emprendi\u00f3 su propia aventura emprendedora, elaborando y vendiendo productos de panader\u00eda.  Hoy tiene una gran oferta de productos deliciosos, entre croissant, galletas, tornillos rellenos, panochas y diversidad de panes que ofrece al p\u00fablico, en su propio domicilio, vendiendo tienda a tienda, de contado y a cr\u00e9dito. Su horario laboral es desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 8 de la noche, todos los d\u00edas de la semana sin cesar. Su meta mas adelante es tener un local, para desagregar su espacio familiar, de su tarea productiva diaria y ofrecer un mayor confort a sus hijos en su vivienda y sacarlos adelant\u00e9 en sus estudios. Pero su mayor desaf\u00edo es obtener un capital de trabajo suficiente, para afrontar la demanda y esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n, por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 harina de trigo, huevos, queso, vitina, frutas cristalizadas, entre otros insumos, para hacer su mayor oferta  en la temporada de fin de a\u00f1o, \u00e9poca en la cual se incrementan sus ventas y por consiguiente sus utilidades, haciendo as\u00ed, de su credikiva una inversi\u00f3n exitosa.","en":"Luz Estela, 36, is married and has two children, ages 10 and 15.  In 2003, she had to start working in order to help cover household expenses because her husband, who had been the sole income earner, lost his job.  She decided to take advantage of her baking knowledge, which came form her husband, and started her own baking business.\r\n\r\nNowadays, she sells a wide range of delicious products including croissants, cookies, cream-puffs, and other pastries.  She sells from home and also to stores, on both a cash and credit basis.  Her work schedule is 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day of the week.  Her goal is to have her own shop, away from the home so her children are more comfortable and able to study.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is having enough capital to meet the demand for her products.  So, she is requesting a CrediKiva loan, her first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She will use it to buy flour, eggs, cheese, shortening, candied fruits, etc. to have more stock for the New Year season.  It is a time when both sales and profits increase, making the CrediKiva loan a successful investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1501748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

The investment was a success, she says.  She bought organic fertilizers to prepare 4 parcels of land for growing coffee and made a small profit.  She repaid that first loan and feels she can hold her head high now because she met her obligations to her lenders.  She is applying for a second loan that she will use to buy more fertilizer for maintaining another recently-planted field.  The first loan improved her life because she had no other way to secure funds for buying the supplies she needed.

She is married and has five children. \r\n\r\nHer son is very hardworking and loves his family very much. He is involved in his own business to have a regular income in the family. He is involved in manufacturing and selling wooden furniture, such as single beds, tables, etc. He started this business over eight years ago. Her son had previously obtained loans for his business; he added up two previous loans to his selection of making furniture. Today, he has many regular customers and also takes orders from other cities. This business yields a good income for him, but his family's needs are increasing day by day and he needs to earn more money. Now he wants to buy more raw materials for making furniture in order to cope with the increasing demand.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Zohra came to BRAC Pakistan and wishes to obtain a loan for her son so he can buy raw materials such as wooden planks, timber, chipboard and glue for his furniture-making business. Zohra hopes that this loan will prove beneficial and productive for the business as well as for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1519642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

She works in the Spitamen flour mill and is a responsible worker. Umida sews clothing in her spare time. She has been interested in embroidery since childhood and lovingly sews traditional dresses for her neighbors, who are very pleased and excited to have a seamstress in the neighborhood. Her eldest son works seasonally in Russia and came back to visit his parents for vacation this winter. His vacation will be over soon and he will have to go back to Russia, but Umida does not have quite enough money to buy a plane ticket. She applied for a loan with MDO Arvand so that she can buy him the ticket. She has high hopes for support and is grateful for the help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1514237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy an airline ticket for her son","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-01-28T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-27T22:20:06Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":111.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":116.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":121.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":126.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":138.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":144.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":151.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.13,"local_amount":97.5,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":100.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144428},{"amount":22.07,"local_amount":101.89,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":105.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960245},{"amount":23.07,"local_amount":106.47,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":110.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479181007},{"amount":24.11,"local_amount":111.26,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":115.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875602},{"amount":25.19,"local_amount":116.27,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":120.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302829},{"amount":26.32,"local_amount":121.5,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":125.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585634},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":126.97,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":131.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081212},{"amount":28.75,"local_amount":132.68,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":137.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562091},{"amount":126.85,"local_amount":585.46,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":605.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694780}],"funded_date":"2014-01-30T04:41:13Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":659918,"name":"Bonface Masita's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bonface is a young father from a slum called Kawangware.

Her children work in construction. Erkingul has a secondary education. The family's primary source of income is animal husbandry, a business Erkingul started 23 years when she bought 18,000 KGS worth of cattle. Erkingul has extensive experience in agriculture, and her farm has all the facilities necessary for livestock. Her children actively help on the farm. Because of Erkingul's hard work, her farm currently boasts three milk cows, one horse, and a 3.60 hectare land share that she works with her children. They primarily sow wheat, barley, and potatoes. Her monthly income is 15,500 KG. In order to further develop her farm, Erkingul approached the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy cattle for breeding. Erkingul plans to invest profits from the loan into expanding her livestock, and she plans to save enough money to buy a house for her son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1517321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ichke-Suu village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-28T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-27T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":70.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erkingul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":729.86,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":40254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":70.14,"payment_id":610751086}],"funded_date":"2014-02-20T06:42:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":662871,"name":"Parsapiyio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parsapiyio is 64 years old, married to Sidio and supports a family of six.

","en":"Zukhra is 33 years old, married, and has two children. Zukhra has a secondary education. After high school she got married. Zokhra neighbors think highly of her. They say she is a kind and hardworking woman. The family's primary source on income is Zukhra's grocery business, which she started in 2007 with an initial investment of 20,000 KGS. She rents her grocery shop. Because of her hard work, Zukhra has been able to develop and expand her business.  Her work brings in about 20,000 KGS per month, which covers food and the household needs of the family. Income from the business has allowed Zukhra to expand her business. In order to further expand her business, Zukhra approached the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy food wholesale to resell. The loan will help  Zukhra increase sales at the grocery store, and the profit will help her raise and educate her children in good living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1517297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy food wholesale to resell.

He is very expert in his profession; he is especially famous for bridal dresses. People like his art, and appreciate him for his efforts. \r\n\r\nHe wants to cope with the demand for bridal dresses; that is why he wants to buy stock of thread, fancy cloths, sequins, and pearls in various colors.\r\n\r\nSalma requires some capital to buy desired inventory for her husband, but she does not have a sufficient amount. \r\n\r\nSo that's why she made a humble request to BRAC Pakistan for a loan.

She has 5 children. She has been involved in tailoring for a period of about 12 years and is proud to be contributing to her household income. When Asia was not earning, her family was going through a severe financial crisis that compelled her to use her stitching skills in a productive manner as her husband was the sole bread winner of the family.

She works three days a week, for about two to three hours a day in the morning.  She can work at this time because her eldest child is at school and she only has to look after the youngest.  She sells her products on credit and collects payment every eight days.  She has been doing this for four years and she has been successful.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy clothes, perfume, cream, cosmetics and costume jewelry.  This is her third cycle in the credit group and she likes it because it is easy to pay off the money.

It is known for its beautiful landscapes and its hardworking people, dedicated to agriculture and raising animals. Monserrate lives here. She is 38 years old, married, and from this relationship has four children, ages 22,19,16, and 12. The two youngest are students in school. Her husband is a baker. \r\n\r\nMonserrate, together with her family, has a bakery in the city. There, on top of baking and selling different types of bread, they also sell food supplies. They work every day from 5:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m., and sometimes until later since they prepare the dough at night to be baked the next day. This way the bread is ready when the customers come to their shop. Their children work with them since this is a family business.

Due to his disability, it is hard for Nikhila to get around, so his wife helps him to transport grocery items from the market. He is a responsible and hardworking man and dreams of constructing a small house for his family and providing his sons with a good education.

In order to provide for his family, he works as a dentist at a local dental practice and he also has his own business.  Although he makes a good income as a dentist, the money he makes is barely enough to feed his family.  As the father of three children, Barot wants to make sure that they are not lacking anything.  In order to bring more money home, he is involved in animal husbandry, which provides an additional income.  His wife helps him to raise and take care of livestock.  Animal husbandry is a very profitable business, and this is why Barot would like to expand his activity in this field by increasing his livestock headcount.  He has turned to Arvand to receive a loan to buy some livestock.  He is really hoping for a positive outcome.

","en":"Kambarali, age 38, is married and he has a few children.  His wife is a homemaker: she takes care of the children but, during her spare time, she also naturally helps her husband run his business.  Kambarali has been involved in animal husbandry for a few years now, and he really enjoys it and makes a good income from this activity.  In addition to raising cattle, he is also involved in rice farming.  However, it is animal husbandry that provides the family with its main source of income.\r\n\r\nEvery two weeks, Kambarali takes his livestock to the market for resale.  Now that winter is here, he would like to buy more livestock as well as some animal feed.  He is planning to fatten his livestock until the spring and then resell it, since the price of livestock will then go up.\r\n\r\nKambarali has decided to turn to Arvand to receive financial support, because he doesn't have enough money right now.  He plans to use his loan to buy livestock and animal feed, and really hopes to receive some help from Arvand, which will help him to achieve his projects.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1507497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
