She was able to buy more products for her variety store. Her loan is helpful not just for her business, but also for the education of her children. Her income from the business helps pay for their everyday household expenditures. She works hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for another 16,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and the children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nHania hopes to expand her business and have more customers. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1458213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her general store business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-01-30T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4266.68,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4513.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459307507},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4266.68,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4513.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467888017},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3200.01,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479111258},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4266.63,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4513.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490806420}],"funded_date":"2014-01-30T06:18:07Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Nicaise","image":1379391}},{"id":663396,"name":"Panai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Panai is 31 years old and married.

He needs the loan so he'll have the rest of the money.\r\n\r\nIn addition to having a place of his own to build a house, he also wants to go to college and be able to have a professional career.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1503185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a plot of land to build his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-12-31T03:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T03:30:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denis Leonardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":44.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":47.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":51.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":53.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":59.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":60.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.28,"local_amount":42.28,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":42.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449622287},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":43.74,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":43.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088510},{"amount":48.27,"local_amount":48.27,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":48.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902764},{"amount":50.74,"local_amount":50.74,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480215966},{"amount":814.97,"local_amount":814.97,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":814.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817324}],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T06:24:04Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:35:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":652642,"name":"Hilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Hilda de 53 a\u00f1os de edad curso hasta sexto grado es madre de 8 hijos quienes cuatro viven con ella una de las mayores tiene 24 a\u00f1os y est\u00e1 en la universidad, el segundo tiene 21 a\u00f1os llego hasta sexto grado y se dedica a la agricultora junto a su padre, la tercera tiene 18 a\u00f1os y curso la secundaria completa, y la \u00faltima tiene 16 a\u00f1os y est\u00e1 cursando el segundo curso de la secundaria ya que con ella tambi\u00e9n viven dos nietos uno de 18 a\u00f1os y uno de 15 y est\u00e1 cursando el segundo a\u00f1os de secundaria.

She is married and the mother of a 17-year-old daughter who is still in school.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide for her family, Mamlakat is involved in two different activities: she owns a retail outlet at the market where she sells vegetable oil, and she also raises cows and bulls for resale.  She enjoys working in animal husbandry, and learned this activity from her husband.  She has now been raising cows for the past six years.  \r\n\r\nRaising cattle is a lucrative business which brings a stable income.  Mamlakat plans to increase her cattle headcount, and for this reason, she is taking a loan of 2,100 USD.  She intends to buy a few more cows and young bulls right now, because cattle is cheaper in winter compared to other times of the year.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1517430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a few cows and young bulls to increase her cattle headcount.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khuroson","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-01-30T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T04:20:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamlakat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":181.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":193.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":199.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":201.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":204.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":213.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":222.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":229.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":236.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":181.76,"local_amount":181.76,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:47:46Z","rounded_local_amount":181.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459153198},{"amount":193.45,"local_amount":193.45,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":193.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467969367},{"amount":199.72,"local_amount":199.72,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":199.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479189660},{"amount":201.89,"local_amount":201.89,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":201.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490883063},{"amount":204.81,"local_amount":204.81,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":204.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504310104},{"amount":213.27,"local_amount":213.27,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":213.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517591911},{"amount":217.02,"local_amount":217.02,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":217.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530087554},{"amount":222.77,"local_amount":222.77,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":222.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542568723},{"amount":229.06,"local_amount":229.06,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":229.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561700726},{"amount":236.25,"local_amount":236.25,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":236.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579637363}],"funded_date":"2014-02-04T00:51:52Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:40:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":663432,"name":"Benilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benilda is thankful for the financial assistance extended to her.

However, he needs an additional 2,000 USD to complete all repairs and to purchase all the necessary utensils and goods.\r\n\r\nNajibullo is taking a loan and hopes to receive some support from Kiva lenders.  He will be serving delicious traditional dishes to his customers, and has decided to set his prices lower than those offered by his competitors.

She is a very poor and needy woman. The major problem of her poorness is that her husband has not adopted a profitable business til yet. She is passing her life with her family by hand to mouth. Her husband provides sheltering services to earn money to feed the whole family. Due to continuously working, the planks have broken and lost their smoothness, which is why they need to be replaced with new ones. Now her husband is unable to continue his business without smooth planks, wooden boards and bamboo. Therefore, Nasreen has requested a loan for her husband so that he will be able to buy new wooden smooth boards and bamboo to continue his business again. She hopes that this loan will bring positive changes in her life and her husband will earn maximum profit with the help of this loan. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1503745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy sheltering materials for sheltering services provided by her husband.

To help her continue the operations of her business, she has requested a loan to buy a sewing machine because her previous sewing machine is out of order due to continuous work. In addition to repaying the loan, she will use part of the revenues to deal with personal expenses.

Her dream is that of very mother--to support her son in his studies and send him to college so he can graduate and not go through the same situation they did in their childhood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1503243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs for her coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-31T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia Yamileth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762852}],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T15:25:48Z","paid_date":"2015-02-26T10:25:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":652686,"name":"Ana Yanira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana  tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad y habita en condiciones muy humildes junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus cuatro hijos de 19 a\u00f1os, 16 a\u00f1os, 14 a\u00f1os y 12 a\u00f1os de edad.

He expects to graduate in December 2014 but without a loan, he is unsure how he will be able to continue affording his education. He shares that his alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until he could return. Renel shares that it is important for him to graduate on time so he can enter into the job market as soon as possible. With this loan, Renel plans to use the loan to cover the cost of his graduation fees. Often there are fees for earning your title in commercial engineering before graduating. In addition to his responsibilities at school, Renel currently works 40 hours a week in a warehouse and earns $9 a day.

Because he comes from a poor family he wasn't able to attend school. He only knows how to read and sign his name. At an early age he had to help his father in the fields growing basic grains. Today Felix has his own home where he lives with his wife and four children. When he got married, his father gave him some land and then he worked hard and bought more.

It takes a second semester to begin practicing, but sometimes she feels that her dreams are thwarted by lack of money. She also has two brothers that are studying and an older sister that is also studying at the same institute in her second semester. Due to her parents' situation with economic problems, she made the decision to defer a semester. She was very sad to have to put her dreams aside which is why she is seeing support from Kiva to be able to continue with her studies. Her goals are to be able to complete her studies, to have good work stability and therefore help her parents to improve their quality of life and show her parents that she achieved her dreams so that they feel proud. She would be very satisfied to know that with her the profession she will be able to provide help to many people in her care.

For the most part, he fattens young steers over a month and then sells them at the local market, the revenue from which is the primary source of income for his family. Mahmayunus is married and has children and grandchildren. He and his family live in the A. Jomi region. At the moment, Mahmayunus has very few livestock in his cattle yard. With the goal of developing his business, he is requesting a loan of 2,000 USD, with which he wants to acquire a few head of young steers in order to increase the number of cattle he can sell.

He is thirty two years old and is a father of three children aged 6, 4 and 3, and he would like to see all of them through school so that they can compete for jobs on the job market. He also does retail trade in the same area and this boosts his income since it gives him additional income from the shop.\r\n\r\nHe started trading in 2011 and continues the business to date with high hopes that it will expand and earn him enough profit. He works four days on the tea business and concentrates on the shop when he is off the tea business, and he says this has rewarded him since he gets more money to cater for his needs. He would like to use the loan money of three million shillings to buy more stock so that he can enjoy economies of scale.\r\n\r\nIn his tea business he is challenged by the unfavourable weather and untrustworthy farmers, who never supply in the required quantities, making it hard for him to supply the factories with the quantities they would like him to supply in a given period.\r\n\r\nEzra thinks that his honesty has helped him achieve what he has achieved in life to date, and hopes to continue to be the honest man he has always been so that he can achieve his dream in

Three years ago she initiated a small general store, to help her bear her household expenditures. She offers a variety of grocery items at reasonable prices. She has retained many customers, who regularly shop at her store. She makes enough to contribute to the family income. She is a mother of two children; one is school-going.

One is in fourth grade and the other one in seventh grade. Only her two children live with her, and they are dependent on her, which means she is the sole breadwinner in her household. Her main job for the last three years has been manufacturing pi\u00f1atas. She learned how in a government-sponsored course given by the city. She also grows 7,000 square meters of sweetcorn, and her children help her by taking care of a small tilapia farm. Thus, she manages to support her children. Ana travels by bus from Monday to Saturday to her workshop. The loan will be used to buy supplies like paper, flour for the paste and wire for the pi\u00f1ata framework to make pi\u00f1atas. Another part of it will be used to buy fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide, as well as feed for the fish farm. Ana says the loan will be very useful, because she will be able to make more pi\u00f1atas, sell more of them, and also have a better harvest. Her dreams are to see her children complete their studies, to make her workshop grow, and to stay healthy in order to make her dreams, with the help of loans, become reality."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1519231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy supplies for her workshop, fertiliser for her crops, and feed for her fish farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-30T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Mirian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":348.34,"local_amount":348.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":348.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146337},{"amount":651.66,"local_amount":651.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":651.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768336}],"funded_date":"2014-01-30T20:41:12Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":663481,"name":"Kousar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kousar is a 40-year-old, married woman.

Due to her parent's economic situation, she was not able to go to school, and on top of this she is a single mother and only lives with one of her daughters and a granddaughter. Her daughter helps her to work while the little one is studying. These are the people who depend on her.\r\n\r\nEsmeralda works in agriculture, and has a lot of experience in these activities since she has spent her whole life working in this profession. In addition to agriculture, she also raises some chickens. She gets up at 5am every day to feed her chickens and then she walks about 10 minutes to the place where she grows her crops. She works until 10 in the morning and her daughter helps out.\r\n\r\nEsmeralda is requesting this loan in order to buy fertilizers for her crops (seeds, manure and pesticides) and chicken feed.

He's currently cohabitating with his partner who is a stay-at-home mom. They have a 3 year old child and live at Daniel's parents' house. Currently he's working as a supermarket vendor, and he's been working at this location for a year. He learned this job at a training session he attended that he enjoyed very much. Afterwards he began to look for work and this is the location where he was given an opportunity. On his days off he does agricultural work with his dad and his brothers to guarantee food security for himself and his family. The work schedule at the supermarket is 6:00 am to 10:00 am and 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm, and it takes him 30 minutes by bus to get to work. He will use the money to purchase a motorcycle, which would allow him to get to work faster as well as return home faster at the end of the work day. This would meet his need for transportation, which is scarce in his area. The dream he and his partner share is to build a house of their own to completely obtain independence from his family. He knows that to make this dream come true he has to keep doing his best at work every day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1519318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

This group is located in the community named Novara, which is very known for being situated by the side of the federal highway and whose primary source of employment is commerce.<br \/><br \/>Margarita is one of the members of this group.  She is a very hardworking, 50-year old woman.  She is single and has one daughter.  She says that she only had the opportunity to study through the fourth grade of primary school.  Her mother taught her to knit and do embroidery so that she could learn a business and earn a little money to help cover her own expenses.

The reason she needs assistance from Kiva is because she previously paid with financial aid that was given to her because she did not work and her mother was working at construction sites during the day.  Yaquelin would like to pay for her degree because she enjoys nursing and getting satisfaction from saving lives, working with other people, and helping those in need of the most care.  <br \/><br \/>Yaquelin has a 10-year-old son and is pregnant at the moment.  She lives with her in-laws, but the person who is helping her is her mother who is always willing to give a hand.  It is true that Sra.

Yaquelin expects to finish her studies so that she can graduate with joy.  <br \/><br \/>Yaquelin asks for the assistance of the Kiva lenders since she is need of their help.

He lives with his partner, who looks after the household chores. He has two children who live with them and are going to school; no one else lives with them. \r\n\r\nHe has been farming for 10 years, and learned the work from his parents. They always said to him that it was better to learn to work than to go to school. \r\n\r\nIn addition to farming, he is also a tractor operator, and learned this from his father. His day begins at 4:00 a.m. so that he can get ready and go to his tractor operator job, where he works 12 hours and returns home at 6 in the afternoon to rest. When there is no work with the tractor, he works growing corn and plantain. He will use part of the loan to grow irrigated corn, buying seed, manure and fertilizers; he will use the other part to cover some expenses for his children's education.\r\n\r\nHis dream is for his two children to be professionals, and hopes they graduate as lawyers. With the loan, he will manage to cover the expenses for agricultural supplies and the expenses for his children's education.  His dream is to leave a parcel of land to each one of his children, in addition to helping them with their university studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1503531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To use one portion for growing irrigated corn, buying seed, manure and fertilizers, and the other portion to cover some expenses for his children's education.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-12-31T22:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-01T22:10:07Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Rufino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":339.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":361.61},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":386.85},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":412.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":386.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":345.11,"local_amount":345.11,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":345.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216637},{"amount":356.35,"local_amount":356.35,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":356.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517527045},{"amount":386.59,"local_amount":386.59,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":386.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420855},{"amount":180.42,"local_amount":180.42,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":180.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595144608},{"amount":231.53,"local_amount":231.53,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":231.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769979}],"funded_date":"2014-03-01T06:21:51Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:25:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":656593,"name":"Rosmaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosmaida is a housewife living with five persons in the family home in Bandung.
