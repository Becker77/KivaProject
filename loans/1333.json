She is a widow and a mother to their children. She, together with her children, manages their household, while operating a business. She is working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\n\nAna Cleta maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. \n\nA customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s costs are lower than those in the catalogue, and the difference represents the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. \n\nAna Cleta's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Ana Cleta is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products, like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other products needed in her business. \n\nAna Cleta hopes to expand her business and dreams to have a better living.

Maha is a 30-year-old lady living in a sector in Jordan called Southern Ghour with her 5 children and her retired husband. She has been trying her best to support her husband in improving their living conditions and covering their children's needs by running her business of selling electrical machines at her own store for 2 months.

Actualmente viven en la casa de sus suegros.\n\t\nEllos se dedican al comercio informal desde hace 3 a\u00f1os, tomaron la iniciativa de modificar una bicicleta y adaptarle una hielera en la parte de atr\u00e1s para transportar mariscos en la temporada y tambi\u00e9n comercializar con refrescos en la zonas aleda\u00f1as, viaja todos los d\u00edas una distancia de 5 kil\u00f3metros ofreciendo sus deliciosos refrescos y es un negocio que le ha generado buenos dividendos debido a que vive en una zona costera y las condiciones del clima son de bastante calor por lo que sus refrescos se vende en tiempo record.

He completed his education through primary school, sixth grade. For the past four years he has lived in the community with his wife and their small son, who is still too young to start going to school. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 and his wife sell natural beverages and seafood. They have been in business for three years. Depending on the season they sell either from a small shelter on the side of the highway near their home; or from a bicycle, to which they attached an adapted cooler in which they transport seafood and beverages in their neighborhood. A typical day includes traveling 5 km to offer delicious refreshments. This business has generated good revenue for them because they live in a coastal zone where the climate is very hot and cool drinks sell in record time.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 typically works in the morning and part of the afternoon, and spends the last part of the day with his family and helping his church.\r\n\r\nThey currently live with his in-laws, and this loan will be used to construct an additional room in which Jos\u00e9 and his wife and son will live. They want to have more privacy than they currently have, in a very small room which doesn't offer good living conditions or security. His in-laws have been good enough to give hem a piece of land on which they can build, and with the help of CrediCampo, Jos\u00e9 hopes to fulfill this goal.\r\n\r\nLike many CrediCampo clients, his greatest dream or aspiration is to have a nice home, without frills, built by his own hands, which he can count on to protect his family against the elements and in which he can watch his son grow bigger every day.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 also hopes to obtain a separate loan for his business, which he will use to build a small aluminum stall from which to sell his products. That way he will not get wet in the winter as he does now because their roadside stall, built out of low-quality wood and palm fronds, allows water to leak through.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to continue being able to count on financing from CrediCampo and will work hard to earn that support by making payments without falling behind."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1516343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She has three children, one grown, and two who are 13 and 15 years old. She has a two-year-old grandson. She lives in Puyo-Putuimi, an area that is hot and humid. It's an area with a variety of vegetation. She works growing and selling sugar cane. She does this by herself and works six hours every day. Her dream was to be a teacher, but she didn't have her parents' support and got married at a young age, so she was not able to achieve her dreams. Her goal is to improve her field by buying organic fertilizer and good sugar cane seeds so she can offer her customers a higher-quality product and increase her income for her children's studies.\n\nGladys seeks credit to buy seeds and raw materials with the goal of bettering her plantation and producing quality products.

Tienen tres hijos, los dos menores estudian y el mayor trabaja, es jornalero. \n\n\nJos\u00e9 trabaja como agente de seguridad  desde hace 9 a\u00f1os, recibiendo como salario $233.00 por mes, estos ingresos no son  suficientes para cubrir las necesidades b\u00e1sicas del hogar, por ello trabaja tambi\u00e9n en la agricultura, cultiva ma\u00edz, frijol y hortalizas (repollo, tomate y chile). Estas actividades agr\u00edcolas, las aprendi\u00f3 desde muy peque\u00f1o gracias a que su padre le ense\u00f1o.\n\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo lo utilizara, para comprar materiales: laminas, madera, clavos y herramientas; ya que el techo de su viviendo se encuentra en mal estado y en la \u00e9poca lluviosa,  las consecuencias de vientos y goteras, le roban la tranquilidad a su familia. Es por ello, que aprovechando que se encuentran en la \u00e9poca seca, quiere reparar el techo y que su familia tenga las condiciones para habitar sin tener que estar preocupados cada vez que comienza a llover.\n \n\nAdem\u00e1s, de tener su vivienda en buenas condiciones quiere dedicarse de lleno al cultivo de hortalizas, ya que disfruta mucho haciendo estas labores y tambi\u00e9n por la oportunidad de negocio que ve en ello, hay gran demanda  y pocos productores se atreven a cultivar esto.\n\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a 43 year old man who is honest and hard-working. Because of many limitations in his childhood and adolescence, he was only able to complete third grade. Now, he is married, and his wife takes care of the domestic tasks and also helps with the agricultural work. They have three children. The younger two study, and the oldest works as a hired hand. \r\n\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has worked as an insurance agent for 9 years, making $233.00 per month. This income is not sufficient to cover his basic home needs, so he also works in agriculture. He grows corn, beans, and vegetables (cabbage, tomatoes, and chilies). He learned these activities at a very young age, thanks to his father teaching him.\r\n\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 will use the loan to buy materials: tiles, wood, nails, and tools, since the ceiling of his home is in poor condition. In the rainy season, the consequences of the wind and rain rob his family of their tranquility. For this reason, he wants to take advantage of the dry season they are in to repair the ceiling so that his family will be able to live without being worried every time it starts to rain. \r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition to having his house in good condition, Jos\u00e9 wants to dedicate himself to growing vegetables. He enjoys the work very much, as well as the business opportunity he sees in it.

Do\u00f1a Gloria, o \"La Chinita\" (como la llaman) tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, es divorciada, tuvo tres hijos con su ex esposo aunque ahora ya solo una de sus hijas, que se encuentra estudiando la preparatoria, depende de la se\u00f1ora Gloria. La Chinita tiene una cocina de comida r\u00e1pida desde hace ya 9 a\u00f1os. \"Con mi separaci\u00f3n, mi autoestima estaba muy mal, pero mi hermano fue quien me motiv\u00f3 para emprender un nuevo negocio. No me pod\u00eda decidir ya que ten\u00eda la idea de iniciar una est\u00e9tica porque estudi\u00e9 cultura de belleza, pero tenia que invertir demasiado\". El hermano de la Chinita siempre le dec\u00eda que cocinaba muy rico y entonces el negocio fue una cocina econ\u00f3mica. Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n para iniciar el comedor tuvo que pedir prestado para comprar art\u00edculos indispensables, empezando por el establecimiento. El local era parte de la casa de los padres de La Chinita, que despu\u00e9s paso a ser propiedad de su hermano y finalmente de Do\u00f1a Gloria. La \u00fanica dificultad que tiene que enfrentar es cuando los precios se disparan, no puede comprar todos los insumos necesarios para preparar sus alimentos y con esto Do\u00f1a Gloria tiene p\u00e9rdidas en su negocio, muchas veces no puede subir el precio de sus comidas a sus clientes. Do\u00f1a Gloria esta solicitando un nuevo cr\u00e9dito para comprar insumos para sus alimentos, tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1 desechables, cazuelas, platos, vasos etc. Ella esta muy agradecida con KIVA y con VisionFund porque gracias a los cr\u00e9ditos ha podido solventar los gastos de hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de su hija para Do\u00f1a Gloria es muy importante que su hija termine de estudiar una carrera profesional para que pueda mejorar su calidad de vida. En cuanto a la cocina econ\u00f3mica, todo parece marchar bien \"Creo que ayuda mucho el buen saz\u00f3n que tengo para complacer el paladar de mis comensales\". Uno de los sue\u00f1os de Do\u00f1a Gloria seria engrandecer su negocio \u201cMe encantar\u00eda hacer mas grande mi cocina ya que es muy peque\u00f1a y muchas veces los comensales no caben en las mesas y se tiene que esperar para que yo los pueda atender, tambi\u00e9n me gustar\u00eda que mi hija terminara de estudia su carrera y llegara a ser una gran maestra; la voy a apoyar hasta donde yo pueda\u201d","en":"Gloria is a lady who is smiling, kind, and above all, very hardworking.  Do\u00f1a Gloria, or \u201cLa Chinita\u201d, as she is called, is 49 years old, and she is divorced.  She and her ex-husband have three children, but only one of them--a daughter who attends preparatory school--still depends on her. \r\n\r\nLa Chinita has had a fast-food eatery for about 9 years now. She says: \u201cBecause of my separation, my self-esteem was very low, but my brother motivated me to start a new business.

It is very important to Do\u00f1a Gloria that her daughter finish studying for a professional career, so that she will be able to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer home-style restaurant seems to be going well, and she says, \"I believe my flavorful seasoning is a great help to me in pleasing my customers' palates\"\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to expand her business:\"I would love to make my restaurant bigger, as it is very small--often there is not enough room for my diners at the tables, and people have to wait for me to serve them.

El Oro is also well-known for an antique train car that now functions as a restaurant. Reme says, \"That was a tiny train that just sat there but now it functions as a restaurant that the people know well. The best part of this place are the delicious coffees.\"  \r\n\r\nReme is a hardworking woman who is always very cheerful. She is 46 years old and has been married to Le\u00f3n for 25 years. Together they have formed a family with three children. One of their children is still in high school. Reme has made a living making school uniforms for 22 years. \u201cI used to work with a man who made uniforms, so I learned from him. Later, I taught my husband and now he knows more than I do. We began with just one simple machine and we only made uniforms for girls.\" said Reme. Little by little, the sewing shop grew, thanks to loans from another lender. When Reme found out about VisionFund and Kiva, she decided to switch institutions and things have gone better for her. This time, she is requesting a smaller loan so that she can buy more fabric and thread, as well as repair some machines that she uses to make uniforms. She also needs fabric in order to keep making pajamas. Her clients have been very satisfied with her work. That is why her customer base has grown, along with her workload. Nevertheless, Reme is requesting a small loan to buy the supplies she needs. She needs to work very hard to generate income because halfway through the year she will need to invest again in fabric when she is busiest. \r\n\r\nReme doesn't seem to be facing any difficulties in moving her business forward, although she would like to get a machine to sew borders so that she does not have to hire others to do this job. Reme will work very hard to purchase said machine and improve her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1403793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, stockings, threads, buttons etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro, El Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-01-31T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-02T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Remedios","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2181.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2358.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2416.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2554.52},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2815.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":167.36,"local_amount":2231.41,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-02T09:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247834},{"amount":177.08,"local_amount":2361.13,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072885},{"amount":181.42,"local_amount":2418.98,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2441.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479290199},{"amount":191.84,"local_amount":2557.88,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2581.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490986603},{"amount":200.73,"local_amount":2676.42,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2701.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504427535},{"amount":206.57,"local_amount":2754.18,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2780.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517705223}],"funded_date":"2014-01-31T09:29:52Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":663918,"name":"Gabil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gabil is a car mechanic.

Near the village where they live, Artak also grows apricot trees. To tackle his financial hardships, Artak also goes abroad for seasonal work. He works day and night to be able to sustain his family's living. Now, to sustain his farm, Artak has applied for this loan. The loan will help him to purchase two cows and forage for feeding the livestock. As this is Artak's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before because they have no credit

He has also worked for 40 years as a tailor, making pants after his day working at the mill.  His day starts at 4:30 in order to go to work at the mill, which takes about 20 minutes, and where customers start to arrive about 5 am.  His day ends at 4 pm, when he returns to his home.  The loan will be used to buy 4 steers, which he hopes  to sell in order to buy his own mill.  His dream is to have his own mill, because he is tired of walking to work, and dreams of working at home.  He would also like to build a brick house, because the one that he owns is made of mud, and to buy 2 more steers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1503959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 4 steers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-01T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-02T05:30:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216638}],"funded_date":"2014-03-01T17:12:05Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":652994,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Pastor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, solamente estudi\u00f3 hasta noveno grado, debido a la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en que viv\u00edan sus padres y tambi\u00e9n por el conflicto armado que se puso dif\u00edcil en el cant\u00f3n donde \u00e9l viv\u00eda.

His family is composed of five brothers and they are very close, supporting each other in every situation.  The main reason William needs the loan is not just to make his financial situation easier and the support that would give him, but actually because for several years he has been interested in the field of cooking.

She chose to go into nursing because when she was a kid she wanted to be a nurse.  She wanted to help people.  One day her grandfather came to the house and was very sick.  She worried a lot about his health and started to take care of him, but his illness was very serious and he died.  This was when she developed a desire to help people, regardless of their social class, race, or the type of illness they might have.  She has an understanding and tolerant personality which has helped her in working toward her dream of being a nurse.  She studied nursing at Sena for a semester but had to leave the program for reasons beyond her control.  Now she is studying at CampoAlto, where she has been given the opportunity to achieve her dreams as well as financial assistance since her family has limited means.  \r\n\r\nPaola's mother, Veronica, is 57, and her father, Jaime, is 59.  They used to be well off, they had everything, but violence forced them to abandon everything and move to the city of Villavicencio.  They started a new life there with their two kids, and the city took them in, providing them with stable work.  The whole family worked very hard there and they bought a house which they later sold to support one of the siblings who wanted to enter the police force.

He is still counting on financial support from Soro Yiriwaso to open a new restaurant somewhere else, where there is a need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1496180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase various supplies for his restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-01-01T08:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-02T08:10:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vincent Paul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T13:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63037.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449741065},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":63037.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220594},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":63037.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045488},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":63037.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263336},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":63037.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960227},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63037.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504676715},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":63037.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676460},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":63037.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530208979}],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T15:37:04Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:29:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":649055,"name":"Yaya","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9 en 16 AOUT 1994 \u00e0 FALAN, YAYA vit dans une  famille nucl\u00e9aire dans la commune rurale de Ouelessebougou. \nN\u2019ayant pas eu la chance d\u2019avancer dans les \u00e9tudes,  tr\u00e8s vite YAYA s\u2019est  int\u00e9ress\u00e9 aux activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus.

decided to build a secure future for their families and formed a group named Maa Kalijai Mahila Self Help Group. The members of Maa Kalijai Mahila Self Help Group are all women from the district of Khurda in Odisha, India. One of them is Posi, who was selected as their president. The lady in the picture seated second from the right is Posi. Posi is 30 years old and lives with her husband and her two children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in the activity of cultivation for a long time. She got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighborhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took over the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. Initially, she started growing only a few vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, and onions but later on she grew bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumbers, ladyfingers and brinjal (eggplant).

He learned this skill while he was in high school.  Francisco currently is in a relationship and lives with his life companion and their newborn daughter.  <br \/><br \/>Francisco\u2019s work involves making French bread and then selling it in the cantons that are closest to where he lives.  He has been in this business for approximately three years and it has allowed him to earn income for his family.  Francisco learned to make bread thanks to the help of a friend who has a bakery.  In his free time, Francisco would sell bread after school by traveling on his bicycle.  Eventually he learned to make bread, which led to his decision to start his own business.  It was difficult at first because he had no customers.  When he made bread by himself for the first time, he was afraid of burning the bread or some other problem.  Francisco was able to overcome his fear and now this is the only activity to which he devotes his time.  He makes the bread with the help of a brother and then distributes it by traveling in his car and going house to house.  Each day he travels approximately 15 kilometers in order to sell French bread.   <br \/><br \/>The money from the loan will be used to buy supplies for making bread, including eight bags of flour, a case of shortening, and a bag of yeast.  These items are essential for making delicious French bread.  <br \/><br \/>Francisco is a hardworking and responsible person who hopes to improve in the future the premises where his bakery is located.

","en":"Jahonteh, age 34, is a responsible and positive man.  He is married and the father of three children.  He lives with his family in a small village.  Their house, however, is quite small and poorly constructed.  Jahonteh's wife is a homemaker: she is a very hardworking and caring mother.  Jahonteh himself works as a master builder and also repairs houses and apartments.  He has been working in this field for more than 15 years.  He makes quite a good income from his job, but the money is just enough to provide for his family, on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nJahonteh's dream is to build a bigger home for his family, but to do this he needs money.  What he currently makes is not enough to allow him to build a new home.  For this reason, he has turned to Arvand and requested a loan to buy building materials for the construction of a new house.  He is hoping for a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their support.

Therefore Shakeela requested a Kiva group loan with three members, from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, she'll provide financial assistance to her husband by purchasing clothes for sewing garments for his business.

Ever since she was a child, Erika has always dreamed of becoming a health professional, however this has been impossible because since she was very young Erika has had to work and study, as there was no one else to pay for her tuition. Everything she has now is a result of what she has been able to achieve by herself. \r\n\r\nSpecialising in the Dental Health Assistant course will be very useful for Erika and complement her knowledge in the health field, which will provide her with better training as well as work opportunities.\r\n\r\nErika is grateful to Kiva for their interest in subsidising specialist courses offered by the Campo Alto Institute. This provides opportunities to many people like Erika who don\u2019t have a way of paying for a professional course. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1519421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay her semester's fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-31T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-02T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen Dayan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":149475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069714},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":149475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882659},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":149475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202023},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":149475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286164},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":149475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224871}],"funded_date":"2014-01-31T12:46:47Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:02:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":662626,"name":"Yeimy Rocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ella es Yeimy, es una mujer emprendedora llena de sue\u00f1os y metas que cumplir, una mujer que busca sacar adelante la familia, ella es trabajadora, luchadora y dedicada.

I'm the second daughter of three siblings: my older sister is 22 and my younger brother is 12.

If I don't get this loan or some help, I will have to drop some classes and maybe even the whole degree, affecting my development as a young person who isn't working yet because of lack of opportunity due to my small amount of work experience. \r\n\r\nMy academic goals are to finish my degree with a good GPA, my family goals are to help my family members to develop themselves too, my personal goal is to be a better person and professional each day. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing my university career, my dreams will be to continue with a Masters or a PhD in Business and then to work in an institution related to international businesses to use what I've learned and to be useful to my family and to society.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1519900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She has been running a business manufacturing \"waan,\" which is a thread-like material used in making wooden frame bedsteads on four legs. She offers various types of \"waan\" in different colors and is famous in providing good quality material in her community.

She is married and has three children. Zamira lives in a small village. She loves her children very much and strives to give them everything necessary for them to grow, develop and realize their potential in society. <br \/><br \/>For this, Zamira is involved in her own business to have a steady income. She buys and sells women's clothing. She buys her goods at a large wholesale market and sells them in the local market of her village. To do this, she has a small shop. <br \/><br \/>Now, Zamira wishes to expand the variety of her inventory and she needs to buy a larger assortment of women's clothing, since this increases demand for her goods among the villagers. Therefore, she applied to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to purchase a parcel of women's clothing. Zamira hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the

He has a secondary technical education. Bahriddin is the father of two daughters and two sons. His wife does not work anywhere; she is a homemaker. <br \/><br \/>Bahriddin is the only one in the family who works. He is engaged in the construction of buildings and homes.

Her husband died many years ago, and Urulkan had to bring up four daughters and two sons on her own. At present all children are married and live separately. The youngest son lives [nearby?] and helps Urulkan on the farm. Urulkan has finished secondary school. As a main source of income, she raises livestock and grows produce. She launched this business 40 years ago by buying livestock for 3000 KGS. Thanks to Urulkan\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes three dairy cows, and 1.5 ha [3.7 acres], where she grows corn, in order to provide fodder and hay for her animals. In additional, Urulkan also sells food items and soft drinks. She has a small stand by her house, which also brings in some income. Her total monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, Urulkan  applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan to buy cattle for fattening and later resale with a high mark-up. Urulkan plans to use the revenues from her loan for an additional expansion of livestock, and she also plans to save up to buy a car for her son.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":1518593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He studies and earns a living at the same time. Samandar is studying in college and wants to become a good specialist in his profession after graduation.\r\n\r\nOne year ago Samandar has started his business feeding calves for sale.

She learned this work at that time and she learned it from her parents.  In order to get to the farms where she does her work she has to get up at 3:00 in the morning and she walks an hour. \r\n\r\nShe wants better conditions for her children, which is why she wants to replaster her house.  She needs to buy cement, sand, and iron, and her house and her family will be safer and able to have more space.  \r\n\r\nIn the future she plans to build a wall so her house will be safer, as she is close to a rock face.  She is also thinking about buying a farm so she can work on her own land so the two children who live with her can go to school, as her first four children were not able to."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1519296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy cement, sand, and iron to replaster her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-31T20:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-02T20:10:05Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":111.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":109.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":118.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":129.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":133.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":137.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":141.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":148.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.77,"local_amount":106.77,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":106.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088650},{"amount":120.73,"local_amount":120.73,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":120.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902939},{"amount":108.38,"local_amount":108.38,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":108.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216131},{"amount":107.76,"local_amount":107.76,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":107.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817485},{"amount":256.74,"local_amount":256.74,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":256.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526016},{"amount":134.84,"local_amount":134.84,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":134.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008497},{"amount":664.78,"local_amount":664.78,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":664.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500573}],"funded_date":"2014-02-03T21:01:07Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:29:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":664123,"name":"Mirasol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mirasol, a mother of two, lives in the town of San Miguel, Bohol, Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe earns a living through the retail sale of kitchenware.

Every day, she has customers beginning very early and she has the pleasure of offering them a great variety of juices, like papaya, strawberry, banana, etc. She also serves frozen beverages that her customers really enjoy due to the tropical climate.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages that has facilitated the development of her business is that the fruits that she uses for her juices are grown in the area, so this is reflected in the low prices that she offers. She enjoys providing attention to her business since she is a very attentive person, and this has given her more customers.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that she has sought from Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support that she has received to continue to move forward.

Irina has been involved in growing vegetables independently for over 10 years already.  This is the most profitable business in the village.  She has 4 greenhouses on the land and plans to build two more.  Irina hoped to use the autumn harvest to purchase everything necessary for the new season, but weather conditions prevented her from doing this.  Just when the wide sales of cucumber began, everything froze, and this is why they did not earn a lot.  Irina knows where to come for help since she requested a loan last year.  The time has come to sow and this is why she really needs additional means.  Irina is grateful for the provided help and hopes for a future partnership.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1518650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to cover her greenhouses in a double-layer film and buy high-quality seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-01-31T21:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-02T21:20:01Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":701.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1134.62,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12069.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":290.38,"payment_id":504278150},{"amount":1013.76,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":12069.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":411.24,"payment_id":517560740}],"funded_date":"2014-02-02T12:01:53Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T12:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":664271,"name":"Samit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samit is 58 years old.

Many of the residents of the region earn money this way. \r\n\r\nAskar currently requests a loan in order to purchase some young bull-calves to develop the family business. With the help of the loan he will be able to increase the number of cattle. Further he will receive a good income from selling the cattle, which he plans to spend on improving the living conditions of the family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1518769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

she grew up, then got married and had two children.  Her father died 14 years ago and left her a house.  She and her husband decided to move and live in the village and started to develop an agricultural business.  Valentina and her husband worked hard and this brought good results.  They bought another plot of land, built greenhouses, installed heating.

He has five children and all of them live in the V. Znamenka village in their own house.  In order to provide for his family, Yuryi has to work a lot, which he is happy to do because he loves his wife and children very much.  His heart especially aches for his daughter, who has been disabled since childhood, and the parents try to provide all of the necessary conditions for a normal life.  The family works together on their land, where they have large greenhouses.  Yuryi grows tomatoes and can do it well.  The business grows every year.  Just like last year, Yuryi is building an additional arched greenhouse.  He did not have enough money to finish building this greenhouse, and this is why Yuryi requested a loan again.  He will use the loan to purchase metal rods.  Now he can plant tomatoes in the spring.  His oldest daughter attends a university, and son got married.  Yuryi wants to help his children to begin their adult lives and provide them with a good start.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":1518660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
