She finished as a working technician in business administration. She is very motivated to continue the program in aesthetics, since she wants to become independent and have an excellent business, in which she could offer all the training in the various areas that she proposes to work in. The area of facial and body aesthetics has called her attention for a long time, and she believes that it is the time to make a reality of her dream to be a great aesthetician. She hopes to receive all the cooperation from Kiva and give all of herself to be able to completely finish the program. The option that they have given her to pay for the semester in monthly payments appears very good to her, since this is much easier for many people who want to continue studying.\r\n\r\nHer long-term goal is to be able to have an excellent beauty salon with a spa and be able to offer customers the best attention and work with the best quality, to thus be able to grow, since she wouldn't want to have a salon if it didn't become a great business. She trusts in the help of God and the will that she has to advance. She knows that she is going to be able to succeed, since she is a very positive person, and thanks to God up to now she has been able to achieve what she set out to do . For her, there is nothing impossible.

Two of her older sons are married and live separately with their families, and the youngest lives with Ainagul.  Her husband works as a security guard at a kindergarten and has a set salary.  Ainagul has a secondary education; she is very energetic and happy. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 35 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ainagul's hard work, today her business contains 4 dairy cows. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Ainagul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a cow in order to increase livestock headcount. Ainagul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to help her son build a house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1519528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Murdash village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-01T06:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-03T06:50:14Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":49.54,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20240,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463057},{"amount":550.46,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30359.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":49.54,"payment_id":610751090}],"funded_date":"2014-02-01T10:56:01Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":664436,"name":"Ibrohimjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrohimjon was born in 1983.

At that time, her monthly net income was around 3,000 INR. It was very difficult on her part to maintain the family. So she, along with eight other women from her village, formed a self-help group named \"Ann Budhimaa SHG\" to access loans from People's Forum. Before that, she had taken out an individual loan from a micro finance institution and successfully repaid the total loan.  \r\n\r\nNow she is earning a monthly income of 5,000 INR. As per the statement of Manju, this small income is not at all sufficient to manage the family along with educational expenses of her son, so she wants to increase her income by the expansion of her existing business. \r\n\r\nShe has planned to use the loan amount to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc.in bulk  for her general store.

This is her story:  My name is Fayri.  I\u2019m 20 years old and I\u2019m the 4th of 5 siblings, born and raised in Mao, Valverde.  I currently live in the Madre Elisea Residence (Hnas. Carmelitas) in Santo Domingo, because my mother is disabled, and the religious people in this shelter took care of me.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m in my 8th semester of medical school at UASD.  I decided to go into the world of health sciences at an early age in the hopes of becoming not only a great professional and providing a better quality of life for my family, but also to someday restore movement to both of my mother\u2019s legs.  She has given me so much strength and love\u2026 and I want to achieve her dream and mine.\r\n\r\nIn January 2010, I entered UASD as a medical student.

I found FUNDAPEC and Kiva.\r\n\r\nGod willing, I am one year from finishing my curriculum and becoming an intern.  If I don\u2019t get the loan I will have no choice but to postpone my education indefinitely, return home, and start over.  My dream is to be able to help my mother, to see her walk again, and help my younger brother meet his career goals with fewer difficulties.\r\n\r\nI want to be one of the best, be comfortable, work in my specialty, and work in my country helping my people.  I know that I can do this with God\u2019s

Her eldest son works abroad, her two middle children are students, and the youngest daughter is a schoolgirl.  Her husband is a taxi driver.  Jamila has a secondary education.  As the main source of income for her family, Jamila works in animal production.  She started 26 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 1,000 soms.  Thanks to her hard work, Jamila's farm now includes: one cow, one horse and twelve sheep.  Her monthly income is 15,000 soms.  In order to further grow her business, Jamila applied for a loan at the Bank Bai Tushum to purchase heifers for cattle breeding. With income from the loan, Jamila plans to invest in further increasing the number of domestic animals on her farm, and plans to save enough money to build a new home for her eldest son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1519613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy heifers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jerge-tal village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-01T16:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-03T16:40:11Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":64.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":591.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":591.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":591.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":591.67,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":30056.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178463},{"amount":573.99,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":30056.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.67,"payment_id":561578236},{"amount":544.97,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30056.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":46.7,"payment_id":610751091}],"funded_date":"2014-02-20T18:36:48Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Max Prilutsky","image":1270958}},{"id":663973,"name":"Sandhya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sandhya is a very strong-minded 26-year-old housewife of Maynaguri town.

Her three children are school-going and read in grade 8, grade 5, and grade 4. Both the husband and wife are uneducated and can only sign their names.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Sudhir, 42 years old, is a cycle-van puller by profession. He earns money by carrying goods and people in his van. He is the only source of income for the family. He can't give sufficient financial sustenance to this family of five members, especially when the prices of everything are going up.\r\n\r\nThus, Sarathi has taken out a loan from Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS) to purchase a dairy cow to start a business selling milk and dairy products. After the cow is purchased, the family will start producing dairy products, like cheese, butter, curd, etc., for sale. They will also use the milk products for family consumption.\r\n\r\nSarathi hopes that the new business initiative will give her a chance to have financial stability and an increased monthly income.  Her goals are to give her children higher education and upgrade their house to a concrete-made one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1521452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Her husband is a taxi driver, taking passengers from village to village. \r\n\r\nElmira has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 14 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work she now has two milk cows, one horse, two bulls and three sheep, with a monthly income of 13,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Elmira has turned to bank Bai Tushum for a loan to purchase cows to increase her head count of livestock.

She has a plan to make the shop bigger and keep multiple things in the shop to satisfy the customers, so she has taken a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BJS to purchase toothpaste, toothbrushes, soft drinks, wheat flour and other household consumables.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn additional profit to fulfill her dream, such as to give a better education to her children. Her profit from business will definitely help sustain her family's daily needs. She dreams to upgrade their house to a pacca one (concrete-made).\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1521461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase grocery items for her existing grocery shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-02-01T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-03T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-02-02T10:08:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":663608,"name":"Rosa Ester","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa, es un madre de familia vive junto a su familia, tiene tres hijos, para sacar adelante a sus hijos hizo la apertura de una tienda en su casa, en la que ofrece productos de uso hogare\u00f1o, por el momento no ha presentado ninguna dificultad en administrar este negocio.\nLa inversi\u00f3n la ser\u00e1 utilizada para comprar detergentes, pastas, granos b\u00e1sicos, bebidas, golosinas, etc., para tener m\u00e1s y mejores productos con los que dar\u00e1 a sus clientes un mejor servicio, espera aumentar sus ventas y mejorar su econom\u00eda.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Rosa es tener un negocio m\u00e1s rentable para mejorar el estilo de vida de su familia y poder hacer modificaciones en el local.\n","en":"Rosa is a mother of three children who lives with her family.

Unfortunately, Qurbonali doesn't have enough savings to buy a wholesale shipment of spare parts, so he has turned to Kiva for a loan.

He wants to feel a part of society and to make his own a living in order to provide for his family.  Maruf's son has a job: he buys and sells coal, but Ma'ruf no longer wants to be a dependent.

Gulchehra has a wonderful and caring family and both her and her husband work tirelessly for the well being of their children. Currently Gulchehra's husband is working in Russia as a taxi driver, while she herself sells groceries at the local market. Gulchehra has a small market stall where she sells candies and sweets, which she brings from the main city. Her business is doing well and she would like to expand it by purchasing more varieties of candies for sale. But this purchase requires more savings then Gulchehra has at the moment. That is why she has turned to micro-finance bank \"Arvand\" for a loan. Gulchehra hopes for Arvand's support as this organization has been able to improve lives of local residents and local

Her youngest son and his wife live with her and help with managing the household. Shaiymkan has a medical degree and works as a nurse in the local hospital. She is an entrepreneurial and hard working woman who also earns additional income by raising cattle. Shaiymkan started 13 years ago by purchasing livestock with 20,000 KGS. Due to her hard work she currently owns a milk cow, 5 sheep as well as 4.5 acres of land where she grows wheat for family consumption and resale. Monthly profits from the farm and livestock add up to 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her farm Shaiymkan plans to purchase more cattle and so increase profits from milk and animal sales. She has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy a few young calves, fatten them and resell at the market with significant profits. She will use the profits from this venture to continue expanding her herd of livestock as well as save enough money to upgrade her household appliances.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":1520347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy steers for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-01T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-03T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":187.46,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shaiymkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2187.54,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":120649.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":187.46,"payment_id":610751094}],"funded_date":"2014-02-25T04:23:45Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":663646,"name":"Hector Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El es hector jose, uno  de los prop\u00f3sitos por el cual eligi\u00f3  esta carrera es porque quiere enfocarse en todo lo que tenga que ver con medicamentos y  todo lo que desarrolla la farmacia,  no solo esto,  si no darle un apoyo o ayuda a la sociedad en cualquier caso o emergencia que se presente, y crear mas recurso de vida para la gente que rodea el entorno.

She started the farm 15 years ago by purchasing livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Due to her hard work and perseverance the family now owns two milk cows, a horse and 10 sheep. The monthly income from the farm is 11,000 som (KGS). In order to continue expanding the business Nurgyz has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy a thoroughbred foal.

","en":"Bogota is the birthplace of Jennifer, who is 26 years old. Throughout her life she has been a person who was formed with principles and family and social values that have allowed her to accomplish her personal and career goals. In the same way, she has been characterized as an entrepreneurial woman with dreams, goals, and ideals, the majority of which she has accomplished. She graduated as a professional in commercial business administration. Now, to continue on a competitive route, she wants to continue studying, but more focused on creating her own business, and the career she has selected is cosmetology and integrated aesthetics. This is why the opportunity that she finds in an agreement with Kiva is relative, since she can accomplish one more goal, which will not only improve her quality of life but also that of her family. She can be a channel to generate employment, having the opportunity to construct a business in the future. Her goal after finishing cosmetology and integrated aesthetics is to create a spa in which various aesthetic services would be centralized, such as a sauna, jacuzzi, Turkish bath, reducing massages, nutrition, gymnasium, depilation, facial cleansing, and so forth, with the goal of offering excellent service to the potential customers according to the market segment. This spa is the vision of an honest and specialized person.\r\n\r\nJennifer sees a business opportunity in the aesthetics market, since it is in continual growth in Colombia thanks to the new markets that have been created over time. The creation of a business with aesthetic services in Colombia is a life project that Jennifer sees very clearly and for which she needs to be in continual training in the area of aesthetics, which means that her studies won't stop with being a technician in cosmetology and integrated aesthetics, but she will also need to complete workshops, specialized training, and courses that allow her to grow in aesthetic and commercial levels to become a specialist in the spa, differentiating her business with quality and dedication."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1520953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":" to pay for a semester of educational fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-02T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-04T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150186.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069740},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150186.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882685},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":300372.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202049},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":150186.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286190},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":150186.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224897}],"funded_date":"2014-02-02T09:49:07Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":663675,"name":"Adolfo Candido","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Adolfo, tiene un hijo de 12 a\u00f1os bajo su cargo,  labora junto a su esposa en la actividad de la agricultura, siembra papaya y guayabas taiwanesa, lo que comercializa para mantener a su familia.

Now there are two milk cows, two calves and 17 sheep in the family herd, and the family grows beans on 10 acres of land. Monthly income from the farm and livestock is 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further grow their business Batma has turned to \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan which she will use to purchase more livestock. She plans to invest the profits by further expanding the herd, as well as saving money for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":787.5,"image":{"id":1520372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

named Taratarini to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their businesses. Alibha, a headstrong and confident lady, is one of them. The lady sitting in front in the photo raising her hand is Alibha. She is 40 years old and lives with her husband, two sons (20 & 15 years old) and her daughter (12 years old). All her children are continuing their studies. Her elder son is studying for an engineering degree. Alibha resides in a rented house in the town, due to the lack of a proper house of her own. \r\n\r\nAlibha has been running a mixture and fried peanut supply business for the last eight years with the handholding support of her husband. She purchases raw peanuts in bulk, fries them, and puts them in small packets in polythene. Her husband supplies them to the retailers at a wholesale price. In addition to this, she supplies mixture at wholesale. Alibha usually supplies 300 kg of fried peanuts to the retailers in a week. She purchases her stock of peanuts from three nearby wholesale market who are 200 km away. She gets a monthly income of Rs 6000 from the existing business. Out of this income,  she is hardly able to manage her household expenses and the educational expenses of her children. As her elder son is studying for his engineering degree at a distant place, the money for managing all these expenses from her scanty income poses a problem. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Alibha wants to purchase more stock of raw peanuts with the present loan. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, since she has to replenish her stock frequently. Alibha hopes to save enough to build a good house of her own. She dreams of giving a better education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group are Ranjulata, Basanti, Bhanumati, Pushpajali and Surendri who are running a meals hotel, a tea stall, a screen printing business, a betel nut shop and a business selling leaf plates, respectively\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1522437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Aisuluu married Marat, her husband, right after finishing high school. Now her oldest child is 16 and her youngest - 5. While her husband is working abroad in Kazakhstan as a salesman, he sends money every month to support his family. Aisuluu has a high school degree and she supports her family by raising livestock and farming. She started the family farm 14 years ago by purchasing livestock with 20,000 som (KGS). Now the herd has grown and the family has one milk cow and 15 sheep, as well as 5 acres of land for cultivation of beans and feed grasses. The monthly income from the farm is 10,000 som (KGS). In order to expand the business Aisuluu would like to purchase mores cattle, so she turned to bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan. She hopes to use the profits from the loan to purchase even more livestock and save money for her children's

He is a farmer and his name is Salimjon. Many young Tajik men refuse to take up farming like their parents and ancestors and, unable to find other work, leave the country to feed their families. But Salimjon has stayed in Tajikistan for his family and is managing the family's farm. He plants crops at all times of the year, as Tajikistan has a mild and short winter and the sun always shines here. During spring, summer and fall Salimjon grows crops at his farming plot, while in winter he raises crops in his greenhouse (which you see behind him in the photo). Currently Salimjon want to take out a loan to purchase seeds for the upcoming planting season. His own savings aren't enough to purchase as many seeds as he'd like. Salimjon hopes that he will get help from Kiva and be able to plant in time and collect a bountiful harvest, which will help his family's

\r\n\r\nMuna was born in 1978. She is married mother of four children, living in a sector in Jordan called Wihdat with her retired husband. Muna has been helping her husband in oil painting on wood for ten years.

Stefany. She needs a loan from Kiva as, according to the information given to her. she is allowed a discount on her semester of studies. Michell is 16 years and decided to study to be an auxiliary nurse at Campo Alto. Michell has always shown herself to be particularly interested in health. She is also a very responsible student. It would be very difficult for Michell and her family to cover the costs of further education as only the father of the family has a job to support everybody.\r\n\r\nThere are seven people living in Michell's home - Michell, her three siblings, her parents, and one grandmother. Michell is getting ready in order to be a small part of society through this important programme, especially as there is a big need for health care workers.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother currently lives with the family as she suffers from vertigo and cannot cope on her own. In spite of how young she is, Michell very much wants to look after and help her grandmother, no matter how much work it takes. Michell always has a good attitude and sees having a spirit of servitude as being very important, particularly for somebody studying for a career in which she will have to cope with so many people.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1520109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay matriculation fees for one semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-02T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-04T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michell Stefany ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069723},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882668},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202032},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286173},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224880}],"funded_date":"2014-02-02T14:21:33Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:02:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":663143,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":593.66,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products -

married with three children.  His wife tends to their home and takes care of their kids.  To have a steady source of income, Ganijon sells mobile phones and accessories from his own store at a local market.  He buys them wholesale at a large bazaar and sells them in his own small town.  There is a huge demand for these kinds of products there, but Ganijon is just barely able to make ends meet in spite of that.  He's even seen his son off to Russia, who went there as a migrant worker in hopes of being able to send money back home to his parents.  At the moment, Ganijon is hoping to expand his business, and thus increase his income.  He would like to be able to sell a greater variety of goods.  As such, he's turned to Arvand for a loan to stock up on cell phones and some accessories for them.  He would like to thank Arvand in advance for their help, and is hoping for a positive outcome.

As such, he's requesting a loan to buy cattle, and has hope that he'll be able to see his plans to fruition with your help.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1520576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-02-02T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-04T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mulloahad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":664704,"name":"Ranju","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ranju is a woman of 30 years.

Her family consists of her husband, two sons and one daughter. Her husband Hirendranath, aged 60 years, is engaged in agriculture.

With the help of his wife Nilima he works hard in their agricultural business.  They grow green vegetables in their own piece of land. He sells the agricultural produce in the local market, and that is an important source of the family's income.  However, his income alone is not enough to cover the everyday needs of the family. To continue running his agricultural business in a sustainable way, Nilima has decided to cultivate potatoes.\r\n\r\nNilima heard about BJS who give loans to rural women for business.

He has a high school education and works as a seasonal construction worker, but primarily earns a living by farming. The family farm was started 12 years ago with initial investment of 5,000 som (KGS). Hard work paid off and he now farms 1.4 acres of land where he grows potatoes, cotton, corn and vegetables for personal consumption and resale.

The family farm was started 30 years ago with initial investment of 2,000 som (KGS). It was hard work but now the family owns  11 sheep and 1.2 acres of land where they grow corn and potatoes. The monthly profit from the farm is 10,000 som (KGS) (~200 US dollars). In order to expand Malikakhon has turned to bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan. She plans to use the money to purchase more sheep. Malikakhon will use the profits from this loan to further expand the herd and hopes to save money for a new barn.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1520602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aravan village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-02T19:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-04T19:50:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":55.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malikakhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":16500},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":340,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":17269.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463066},{"amount":303.91,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":16761.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.09,"payment_id":610751101},{"amount":300.27,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":16761.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.73,"payment_id":696499985}],"funded_date":"2014-02-05T05:56:20Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:49:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":663619,"name":"Evert Lito","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Evert Lito tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa e hijos en el caser\u00edo de Cabra Chica del distrito de Pucar\u00e1, una comunidad que se caracteriza por su clima caluroso, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio de frutales, caf\u00e9 entre otros, ubicado a dos horas de la ciudad de Ja\u00e9n, que pertenece a la Regi\u00f3n Cajamarca, sierra norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nEl se dedica a la agricultura, espec\u00edficamente al cultivo de pi\u00f1a, tiene una experiencia de 10 a\u00f1os en este rubro, es conocido en la zona por dedicarse a este rubro, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 2 500 nuevos soles para la compra de abonos para darle mantenimiento a sus cultivos y pago de mano de obra y de esta manera le ayudara a la mejora tanto fisiol\u00f3gica, morfol\u00f3gica y productiva de su cultivo, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n tener una cosecha oportuna, y por ende tendr\u00e1 mayor producci\u00f3n, una mejor calidad de producto, por lo cual no tendr\u00e1 problemas en vender su producto.\n\n","en":"Evert Lito is 35 years old and lives with his wife and children in the small village of Cabra Chica in the Pucar\u00e1 district, a community characterized by its sweltering cimate.

Her two eldest children are already college students, but the youngest is still in school. Zuurakan has a high school education and earns a living by raising livestock. The family farm was started 24 years ago with initial livestock purchase worth of 1,000 som (KGS) and now they own a milk cow, 10 sheep and 2 goats. The animals are well provided for, have a comfortable barn and a lot of feed: 500 bails of corn stalks and 400 kilograms of corn. Monthly profit from the farm is 11,000 som (KGS).

Nazgul will use the profits from this loan to further expand the herd and hopes to save money for her kids' education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1521137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karazhygach village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-02T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-04T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.93,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5079.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463068},{"amount":92.09,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5079.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.91,"payment_id":610751103},{"amount":181.98,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10158.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.02,"payment_id":696499987}],"funded_date":"2014-02-02T23:20:02Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:49:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":663779,"name":"Ainura","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0439\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0435 40 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0410\u0439\u043d\u0443\u0440\u044b -

Jose and his family are the only residents in his home.\r\n\r\nJose grows basic foods. Since his youth, he has enjoyed this activity. His grandparents taught him these skills and, in addition, technicians from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock have provided technical assistance. This is how he has learned to farm and advanced his family. The place where he farms is located a kilometer from his house and he goes there on foot. Jose has never pursued another activity He has always depended on sowing basic foods. He is often assisted in the work by his wife and eldest daughter, and generally, he labors in the fields from 7:00 am until 1:00 pm.\r\n\r\nThe loan Jose is requesting through CREDICAMPO is for purchasing 2 quintals of fertilizer and 1 liter of herbicide, plus manure and fungicide, in order to improve production. The loan will increase their quality of life, since they will obtain better earnings from the harvests and the family will benefit in terms of food, health, education, and clothing. The loan will fulfill the need to buy agricultural inputs all at once, without having to incur so many extra costs.\r\n\r\nJose's dream is to become a prominent producer. To do that, he wishes to purchase an adequate irrigation system to water his land more effectively, aid his daughters to forge ahead in their studies, and, one day, to be able to generate other and

Muborak runs her business independently as her husband and sons are working abroad in Russia, while her daughter works as a cook at the cotton mill. Muborak's cell phone store is located next to the central market, which is busy location and attracts many clients. Currently Muborak would like to take out another loan to further expand her store.

Saidamo lives with her husband and two daughters. Her husband is a chef. He works, providing his services, at a cafeteria in the central market. Saidamo has set herself the goal of opening her own store. She has a place for the store in a good location in the city, and she used the rest of her saved money to buy two glass front refrigerators. Saidamo is going to sell grocery items. She has a good business plan. The only thing left that she needs to do to open the store is to buy the inventory of groceries. She doesn't have enough money left through, so she is asking for your financial help. She truly needs this loan and is asking to be given the opportunity to open her own grocery store.

Jazgul has a college education. She earns the primary source of income for her family by farming and raising livestock. She started the business 14 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work, Jazgul now owns eight milk cows, a horse, 25 sheep, and 2.34 hectares of land, where she grows fruits and vegetables for family use and sale. Her monthly income is 9,000 som (KGS).

They currently live at home with their three children who are in school.  During their free time, his children help with the farm work and they are the only ones who are dependent on him.  <br \/><br \/>Jos\u00e9's method of farming involves planting vegetables in greenhouses.  He says that he receives support from an institution that provides materials and technical assistance for growing his crops.  Jos\u00e9 has been in this line of work for several years, from a young age.  His parents taught him this trade since it was the only means of working and generating an income at the time.  This is why he works in agriculture.  In order to arrive at the place where he works, Jos\u00e9 must walk 30 minutes.  His wife and children help him with growing the vegetables.  <br \/><br \/>This loan will be used to buy an irrigation system for his vegetable crops that he planted over the summer since it is necessary to keep them watered.  With the help of the loan, the task of watering the plants will be more efficient, which will free up time that he can devote to other activities.  <br \/><br \/>Jos\u00e9 wants to become a large producer of vegetables, so he plans to expand his greenhouse with existing technology and hire more staff to help him with the work related to his crops.

He began this business three years, since there weren't many similar businesses in his community. This is why he made the decision to begin this business, which has helped him to contribute to the economy of his family through the income and earnings that he obtains from it.\r\n\r\nHe is applying for a loan of 10,000 quetzales to buy products of daily consumption (coffee, corn, sugar, etc.) to be able to increase his earnings and offer better service to his customers.\r\n\r\nEverardo's dream is to enlarge his store and have a greater variety of products. In addition, he would like to buy other plots of land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1521641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

","en":"Andr\u00e9s Felipe is a 17-year old student at La Instituci\u00f3n Campo Alto. He is originally from Bogot\u00e1 and just started his first semester. He loves playing football and feels very attracted by the field of mechanics, the automobile industry and everything that has to do with cars and modern technology. He is currently unemployed because of his age. He recently finished high-school and is still a minor, so he has not been able to find a job to cover his tuition expenses. This is why his father will cover tuition at La Instituci\u00f3n Campo Alto. His mother is a housewife and cannot contribute any income, and his father's income is just slightly above the minimum wage and barely covers their household expenses. \r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s is requesting financial support from Kiva. This help would allow them to save for the house and would represent a financial support for him and his parents. Andr\u00e9s expects to become a professional in 5 years once he graduates from his studies in Motor Mechanics. His goal is to graduate this year as an Industrial Technician in Motor Mechanics from La Instituci\u00f3n Campo Alto. He would then be able to use this title to finish the professional degree at a university. He would like to start his own garage while he studies and to become a sales promoter of all types of cars, known by several car brands. Once his garage was working well, he would look at having his own authorized car dealer in the city of Cali.

She is strong, dedicated, committed, organized, respectful and with great aspirations.  Despite the circumstances and adversities that she finds herself in, she always succeeds and manages to get ahead with her head held high and without giving up her fundamental principles.  She lives with her 33 year old mother who guides her and is her only source of moral and financial support for her and her one and a half month old son who is the engine for her motivation to become a person who sets the example.  She also has a 15 year old sister who visits them on the weekends because of school, and an 11 year old brother who lives with his father in Caqueta.  He stays in touch by phone and visits during vacations.  He is in 11th grade and attends Robert Hooke, a seminary school which is in his best interest given life\u2019s adversities.\r\n\r\nShe is also about to begin her fourth semester as a nursing assistant student.  Jeimy Alexandra chose this career path because she is passionate about it and has shown herself as an example to her mother who currently works in said profession.  She aspires toward this career and in the future wants to support her financially. \r\n\r\nShe also wants to get her son ahead and continue her studies in pediatric medicine.  This adolescent young woman needs a Kiva loan because she doesn\u2019t have the financial resources to complete this stage of her life.  She also has educational aspirations and depends on her mother financially, who not only pays for her education but also her two siblings\u2019 and grandson.\r\n\r\nJeimy Alexandra is dedicated and loves what she does, but needs a hand and continues to believe that she will not halt her life because of an obstacle.  She wants to be a dedicated assistant and human being so she can not only treat physical afflictions, but also personal ones for her future patients.  What she gives of her heart will be rewarded.  She wants to be an example for her mother, become an excellent professional, and help those in need.  She is jumping into this profession to succeed personally and in her life\u2019s plan.  She only needs a helping hand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1520113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-03T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-05T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeimy Alexandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069724},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882669},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202033},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286174},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":150711.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224881}],"funded_date":"2014-02-03T07:25:54Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:02:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

technology most of the people are more interested in making money and managing their time. Less people are able to pay their attention to their family, to their children, to their relatives and friends. Such things as quarrels, fatigue, irritability, stress and misunderstandings are common nowadays. We are not surprised by the huge amount of divorce, crime, alcoholism, drug addiction etc. I believe, the human being deserves better life and I want to help people to prevent them facing such situations.\r\n\r\nI want to become a psychologist. Being a psychologist I can help people morally if not materially, advising what to do in difficult times, where to get support and explaining the reasons for those problems. As we know, especially orphans, disabled and old people are in need of psychologist.

Europe is a global political and economic center that exerts enormous international influence. I want to have a career in a supranational organization or in a national organization that are active internationally.\r\n\r\nStudying at European Studies is really interesting and it has a lot of perspectives for me. As there are many old people, who need a shelter, and the amount of orphans is increasing year by year, my aim is to work for the EU or NGOs of Europe in Kyrgyzstan by organizing such projects as: Rehabilitation centres in every corner of my country, nursing homes and orphanages. \r\n\r\nAUCA is the most active and most successful University in Central Asia in researching and participation in

","en":"Silvia is 43 years old and currently separated because her husband left her.  Silvia works a plot of corn and learned this from her parents because that is what they did.  Since she was the oldest child she had to help support the home.  She also bought two cows and started selling them after one year to earn year end money.\r\n\r\nShe rises at 5:00 am to do the household chores, she then goes to where she has her corn crop and returns at 1:00 pm to continue working and goes to where her daughter lives at 4:00 pm.  Her daughter sells tortillas and she helps her, since she is not able to help her financially.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy two cows and some products for the land she is working at the moment.  This is the month when she begins to work and projects out to the end of the year.\r\n\r\nSilvia wants to have a better house and provide her son with the education that she was not able to have.  In this way she can have better work opportunities.  She is certain that she will be able to make her dreams a reality and is grateful for the opportunities, such as a boost in work, that the loans provide her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1520985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy two cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-03T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-05T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":825.98,"local_amount":825.98,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":825.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545741},{"amount":174.02,"local_amount":174.02,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":174.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146343}],"funded_date":"2014-02-03T22:21:50Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.
