In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nPacita dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes to have a better living.

He is married, and his wife sells bread. The household expenses are covered by them both; they are the parents of 5 children of which two live with them, the young woman working and the young man studying for his Bachelor's.\r\n\r\nHe is an agriculturalist and also takes care of cattle, which he learned from his childhood, as his father taught him the work and so he decided to work the land, and what he gets from it is to sustain the household. Before, he raised poultry, which they had in a room in the house, an activity he did together with his wife and two children, but for the lack of their time when the children began studying and working he and his wife did not have enough time to raise the chickens, so they had to abandon the poultry business and pursue another activity.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking is to pay for labor to begin agricultural work for the growing season, now that he tills various cubic meters of land and needs to have the soil prepared in anticipation of the lack of labor when the season begins; his primary concern will be that when the sowing season starts he already has everything ready to cultivate.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to improve his finances and the quality of life of his family. He hopes that his children obtain and academic career and thus have better opportunities in society. The loan will be of great use since with it he would begin the work of cultivation. Everything obtained from the business will help him to continue splitting it between his son's studies and the household economy of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1518150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for labor to begin agricultural work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-03T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-05T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768314}],"funded_date":"2014-02-13T23:50:11Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Barrington Lloyd","image":null}},{"id":665002,"name":"Riffat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riffat is 36 years old.

She completed her primary education in that community with her parents' support and a short time thereafter she met the man who today is her husband and the father of her children and she went to live with him in another community.  Two of her children are in school and the others are already on their own.  She has a business selling clothing, which she sells in neighboring communities, and she also works in the coffee fields during harvest season.  This provides her with additional income and also allows her to sell clothing to her colleagues.  Her husband is also a businessman and together the two of them get their family ahead.

She is married and the mother of three children. She is a determined woman. Because of the difficult economic situation that affected her parents in her childhood, she was not able to educate herself academically. This was not a limiting factor for her family to get ahead due to the help of her husband, a man who makes a living working hard in agriculture. With a lot of effort they succeeded in raising money to buy two calves that after a long time fattened. They were sold to help one of their children that decided to go to the United States looking for better living conditions. With the help of their son they were able to buy a heifer, which helped them to have three at the time. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has nine years of experience raising livestock. After fattening the heifers, she sells them and buys another two or three to fatten and afterward sell. Mar\u00eda is very smart, seeing as with this occupation she has been able to bring in income that helps her family greatly to cover some necessities for the home.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan in order to consolidate a small debt that for the time being she cannot cover. A year ago, Mar\u00eda acquired some money that helped her be able to buy medicines for the heifers that were sick. She could not cover the costs, so she found herself obligated to find a loan, which she hopes to be able to pay with this credit. Right now she is waiting to sell her cows so that she may buy three heifers.\r\n\r\nIn the future Mar\u00eda hopes to be able to buy more heifers in order to give her children a small inheritance that they can have available and to make it possible to continue increasing the number of animals so that they can have a strong and secure source of income. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1521768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to consolidate a debt.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-03T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-05T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Jorge ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":225,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":36.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.33,"local_amount":38.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":38.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088673},{"amount":39.99,"local_amount":39.99,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":39.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902988},{"amount":40.26,"local_amount":40.26,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":40.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216180},{"amount":41.89,"local_amount":41.89,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":41.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817529},{"amount":43.27,"local_amount":43.27,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":43.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242961},{"amount":21.26,"local_amount":21.26,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":21.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526055}],"funded_date":"2014-02-03T18:54:17Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:16:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyssa Hopun","image":1287558}},{"id":664218,"name":"Ana Iris","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana tiene 26 a\u00f1os, es ama de casa, no tiene estudios acad\u00e9micos;  tiene dos hermanos, ella es la tercera de los tres hijos de su madre, Ana; tiene un hijo de once a\u00f1os, estudia cuarto grado de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, es  madre soltera, su pareja emigr\u00f3 a los Estados Unidos, Ana y su hijo viven en casa de su madre, pero es ella quien sosteniene economicamente la casa. \n\nDesde hace un a\u00f1o, tiene un molino, tambi\u00e9n vende tamales, algunos mariscos como cangrejo y pescado desde hace cuatro a\u00f1os, esto es algo que aprendi\u00f3 de su madre y decidi\u00f3 dedicarse a lo mismo, pues tenia mucha dificultad econ\u00f3mica.

This canton is known as the \"Sultana del caf\u00e9\" (Coffee's Sultan's wife), because of its extensive cultivation of coffee with a distinctive taste, its gastronomy and the warmth of its people. Teresa, 67 years old, lives here. She is married and has four adult children, two of them still live with her. Her husband is a general contractor. Teresa has a restaurant in her house. Every day delicious lunches are prepared here, which are craved by her customers who come daily to her restaurant. She prepares very healthy dishes, a possible reason of her customers' preference. She started this business 8 years ago, thanks to a loan she got from the credit group, for which she is very grateful. This is how they have managed financially since her husband's job is not steady. She works with the help of her daughter-in-law, whom Teresa employs and also helps with her expenses. She will use this loan to buy rice, meat, fish and other food supplies to prepare food. She has belonged to the Credit Group for 10 years, and she likes it because, thanks to one of those credits she started her business. Her goals are to continue with her business.

Dilijan considers it to have the purest salubrious nature  and the most bracing air in the whole region, since here forests are virginal and anyone who comes here just admires it and falls in love with this place. That is why this city has a lot of comfortable and high quality rest houses. \r\n\r\nAt one of these sanatoriums Nver works now. He works here as a sanitary engineer, but as he says work in rest houses is seasonal and in autumn and winter, tourists are very few, so his family income becomes low as well. Nver owns a nice cute farm, where he breeds two cows and a calf, and he manages to sell a lot of milk right from his house. \r\n\r\nNow Nver has a good, profitable idea and he needs some help to realize it; he has a big garage near his house and on the bottom of it he wants to build a small guestroom which he plans to rent to tourists during summer.

The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

Other than farming, she is also involved in her community's activities such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Jane described her harvest last year as excellent, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nJane first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season.  Jane joined the One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nJane plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Jane\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from the harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Jane and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":1490138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-03T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-05T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":3900,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":336987,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3900,"local_amount":336987,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":337349.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722904}],"funded_date":"2014-02-15T03:59:34Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":665124,"name":"Nalulwe's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nalulwe is a member of this group in Webuye District.

Namisi has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 91 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nNamisi is 46 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years.  Namisi works as a farmer to provide for his 4 children.  The community and other farmers know Namisi as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Namisi described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of the One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\r\n\r\nNamisi first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2008 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Namisi joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Namisi plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Namisi\u2019s own life was improved because he has greater profits from the harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money, and to feed the family.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Namisi and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5650,"image":{"id":1490188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-03T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-05T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":5650,"lender_count":156,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Namisi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annarine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wanyonyi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":486759,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":486759}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5650,"local_amount":486759,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":488724.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579722908}],"funded_date":"2014-02-17T17:39:38Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:34:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":663689,"name":"Francisco Jacob","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Francisco Jacob es originario del municipio de El Sauce un poblado ubicado al occidente del municipio de Le\u00f3n.\nEste joven tiene 22 a\u00f1os y a pesar de ser muy joven es bien responsable sobre todo en su trabajo y obligado con su mam\u00e1.\nSe desempe\u00f1a como operario de limpieza en una Instituci\u00f3n de la localidad donde su trabajo principal es recolectar la basura de las calles para mantener limpia la ciudad.\nFrancisco Jacob en este momento necesita un cr\u00e9dito para pagar consultas m\u00e9dicas y realizaci\u00f3n de ex\u00e1menes de su mam\u00e1, ya que con su bajo salario solamente alcanza para la comida, porque es el quien tiene a su cargo a su madre.\nEst\u00e1 muy agradecido con Kiva y Ceprodel por apoyarle con los cr\u00e9ditos ya que son de gran ayuda que benefician a las personas de escasos recursos que muchas veces necesitan para resolver problemas de salud y econ\u00f3micos.\nEspera que le sigan apoyando para tener sana a su madre.\n","en":"Francisco Jacob is a young man who is originally from El Sauce, a village located in the western part of the municipality of Le\u00f3n.

They have a small piece of land, very adjacent to their house. They have decided to start cultivation of potatoes there. They have chosen this business because potato is a very essential vegetable, used in almost every dish in her locality, and so Rejia thinks this will be a lucrative business. \r\n\r\nRejia has taken a loan from BJS to purchase potato seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation as early as possible. Her husband will assist her greatly in her daily activities related to farming, and she is very hopeful to earn a profit from this new business.

Her husband also helps her in her business. \r\n\r\nIn order to grow her business, Anjali has decided to purchase one more cow. She heard about BJS and that they give loans to rural women to start new businesses. She has taken a loan from them to purchase another cow. She hopes that this will help her to sell more milk so she can generate more profit, with which she will be able to fulfill her dreams, such as educate her son properly, give financial assistance to her family, and to purchase a Maruti car for their own use.\r\n\r\nShe thanks her lenders (BJS and Kiva) for the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1523059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase one more dairy cow for her milk supply business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-02-03T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-05T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anjali I","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-02-03T23:47:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":665040,"name":"Olga Diane","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Diane est une jeune dame c\u00e9libataire \u00e2g\u00e9e de 31 ans m\u00e8re de famille.

They live in their own house in the small town, Dhupguri, in the district of Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nSaraswati's husband works hard on their farmland. Their two sons also assist him. Saraswati, though a housewife, helps them after managing her household work. They grow different vegetables in different seasons and sell them in the local market to earn their livelihood. Unfortunately, they are unable to meet the family expenses of four members with this small income.  \r\n\r\nThey need to expand the business, but they don't have the capital. So, Saraswati applied for a loan from BJS to purchase seeds for beans, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. They will cultivate beans on their farmland, as beans are in great demand in the present market. She hopes this business will give her extra profit to reach her goal of providing a better lifestyle to her family.\r\n\r\nShe desires to upgrade their house to a pacca (concrete) one, and she plans to use the rest of the profit to reinvest in her business.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to her lenders (BJS and Kiva) for the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1523063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase bean seeds and fertilizers to cultivate beans on their own farmland.

His parents made an effort to allow him to attend school through ninth grade.  He started high school, but due to the financial situation of his family, he was not able to continue studying.  His life partner works in fishing and takes care of their home.  She is the only one who lives with him and depends on him.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 works with his father-in-law at a metal structure workshop.  He has been doing this all day for three years.  He started as an assistant without pay in order to learn, and today he does this job very well since he has learned a lot and his boss has a lot of confidence in him.  At night, he also works as a fisherman since there is a lake close to his house.  That is the main income for the majority of the people nearby.  When he returns home, his life partner sells the fish that he was able to catch during the night.  She has done this since she was very young, since her father was also a fisherman and taught her.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting this loan to repair their small house, since it needs roof repair, and also to purchase some fishing tools so that he can catch a larger quantity of fish and have better profits for him and his family.  His dream is to have his own home so that he and his wife and their future children can have a dignified place to live.  This loan will help them repair where they are living currently and to purchase fishing tools to improve the family

is a rural married woman who was educated up to grade 8. Her husband Tapan is 35 years old and is a farmer by profession.  They have a daughter who reads in grade 10. They live in Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri in their own house.\r\n\r\nChonchola's husband is engaged in an agricultural business and has been doing farming for more than five years. He grows vegetables on his land and sells them in the local market.  His farming is the main source of income for the family.  Chonchola helps her husband in farming and is a hardworking and ambitious lady. She also runs an animal husbandry business to help her husband run the family well.  Yet, they are unable to give sufficient financial sustenance to her family.\r\n\r\nNow they have decided to start a new business selling milk and milk products.

She is a young woman, just 16-years old.  She was looking for an educational institution to attend, as she was going to a high school that doesn't have any agreements with any higher education institutions that would allow her to finish high school with a technical degree.  A technical degree would prepare her to face financial difficulties and find employment that would allow her to pay for studying a profession.  She went to one institution, but that one didn't have an academic schedule that would allow her attend high school and the institution.  She was looking for an institution that would offer the \"AUX CONTABLE\" (accounting assistant) academic program.  In high school, Leidy's mother had taught her some accounting work, which she herself did for a company.  Leidy liked it because she was good at numbers and accounting, and she decided on that program. \r\nEvery day heading home from school, Leidy would go by the \"Campo Alto\" Institution.  She went with a cousin to ask about the program that she wanted to study.  Leidy told Campo Alto that she was in 10th grade.  They offered her a discount and support for all her semesters of technical study.  That really caught Leidy's attention because her mother was the one supporting her with her goal, and Leidy is not an only child.  Leidy has two siblings, and the family didn't have enough in their budget for her to able to continue her studies.  Her mother was the one paying the rent and all of their schooling. \r\nLeidy wanted to meet her goal that after finishing high school, she would work by day and study at night, so as to help her mother financially.  Leidy told her mother about the offer, and they decided that she should register with the institution.  She had good academic performance at Campo Alto and never missed a class.  She wants to continue her studies and to graduate, but the discount that she had with Campo Alto expired, the subsidy she had for finishing high school ended and her school fees went up.  Leidy's mother told her that she didn't have the money to pay such high fees.  Leidy went to Campo Alto and they offered her a discount through Kiva.

They had a beautiful home formed with Diego, a man who arrived in their lives some years before. Everything was wonderful until this man started to change and behave in a completely different way. The relationship with Amanda started to deteriorate; with this woman who all she did was work and keep a perfect home. After 8 years he had a car accident that left him in a wheelchair. For them it was a hard blow; nevertheless they stayed with a man who kept treating them very badly. One day Amanda got a call where she found out her mother was very sick in the hospital. She went to help her, but her husband did not support her in the way she was expecting. On the contrary, she found a completely different man: rude, arrogant, violent, humiliating, who treated her as an unworthy person. She decided to study a profession that would allow her to have a job and decided to be an accounting assistant. She found out about Kiva and decided to have the opportunity to belong to this agreement so that she would be paying less in her monthly tuition and could have more stability in her work. She decided to live with her mother and leave the man, who was hurting both her and her son, who thanks to be so loved has been able to overcome the trauma that this man left in these two lively and enterprising people. Today they are living with Amanda's parents, peacefully and full of love to share with the people they meet. She wants to be a good accountant and her beautiful son, for now, an excellent high school student. \r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1522204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay a semester's tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-04T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-06T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":624000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":109009.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069756},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":109009.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882701},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":208000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":218018.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202065},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":109009.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286206},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":109009.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224913}],"funded_date":"2014-02-04T01:23:51Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Mueller","image":null}},{"id":662597,"name":"Ana Lilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana Lilia lives in Totolapan, Morales with her husband Edgar and their young son Axel.

She used to pay all the annual fees at the end of the year before the annual exam started and she was able to do that because the head of the school took their case under consideration and was very concerned about her son. Her son is bright and ambitious in achieving his goal. She raises cattle to generate an income and supports her husband who is also a farmer.  When sales went down and the family was short of money, she gave the school their cattle or their farm products in exchange for school fees or annual examination fees.\r\n\r\nWith the KIva education loan, she pays her son's admission fees, and buys sets of school uniforms, textbooks & stationary and tuition fees for a complete 12 months. She says, \u201cThank you so much Kiva and WSDS\u201d.

Abduvohid's wife is a homemaker, and his sons work with him. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago Abduvohid started his own business manufacturing iron doors and gratings. He makes the products himself, and his sons paint them. Abduvohid mostly runs his business out of his home. However, because there are electricity shortages in winter where he lives, he sometimes rents space at a manufacturing shop and works there.\r\n\r\nAbduvohid is in need of a loan to expand his production. He wants to acquire a modern electric welder and is hoping for your

vivian en una pobreza que les impedia darle esa ayuda sus hijos, sumando a esto que la escuela mas cercanas estaba a una distancia de aproximadamente cinco kilometros, lo que dificultaba mas la situacion. Ahora esta casado, no tiene hijos, su esposa se dedica a los quehaceres del hogar.\n\nMoises a los 10 a\u00f1os de edad, ya trabajaba junto con su padre en la siembra de maiz y frijol. Asi fue como aprendio este oficio. Ya a los 14 a\u00f1os de edad, sembraba solo su propia terreno de maiz y frijol. Desde entonces se a dedicado a trabajar en la agricultura, ademas trabaja como jornalero en una finca cafetalera de 6:00 A.M a 11:00 A.M. El lugar donde cultiva esta a una distancia de 2.5 kilometros y el recorrido lo hace montando en su yegua todos los dias.

","en":"Moises, who is 30 years old, did not have the opportunity to study in school.  His parents were living in poverty that prevented them from being able to help their children in this aspect.  To make matters worse, the closest school was approximately 5 kilometers away, which made the situation more difficult.  Now Moises is married.  He does not have children.  His wife dedicates her time to taking care of the house and domestic responsibilities.  At 10 years old, Moises was already working at his father's side in the cultivation of corn and beans.  That was how he came to learn this trade.  At 14 years old, he was already developing his own plot of corn and bean crops.  Since then, he was dedicated to working in agriculture.  Also, he works as a laborer on a coffee plantation from 6:00am to 11:00am.  The place where he grows his crops is 2.5 kilometers away and he makes the trip by horse each day.  His wife also helps him with his agricultural work involved in the process of production.  The loan will be used to buy livestock for pasture, which is developed throughout the course of the year in order to finally sell it and generate income for his family.  As such, this will help so that their income is not solely dependent on agriculture.  Moises dreams of being able to live in the present, of having his own house, for when the time comes where he has his own children and builds his family, and being in the right circumstances so that they are never lacking anything.  Also, he would like to have a dairy cow and more animals.  It is important that Moises continue putting in all his effort in order to achieve these dreams.  With the help of these loans, accomplishing his goals and dreams is a little more within reach.

Because of his economic situation he didn't study past Grade 1. He was the oldest of 3 siblings and had to help his parents work as his family was very poor.  He is separated because in his youth he had problems with alcohol and due to this his family fell apart. He lives alone paying for this error.\r\n\r\nJose today grows corn and beans. He has done this work since he was a child. His father taught him as at that time there was no other way to survive outside of agriculture. He rents 14,000 square meters of land which he has bought with his efforts. But at his age he can't work much. He gets up at 4 am and has to walk to his land where he grows his corn, 2 kilometers by foot. He has no set closing time as he stays until he has done what he had planned. He then goes home and does the housework as he lives alone. \r\n\r\nJose will use the money from the loan to plant 7000 square meters of corn as this is the time to get things started for the year. Right now he has five sacks of beans that he has not sold as the prices are too low and he is waiting for the prices to climb. \r\n\r\nJose in the future has the idea of having a better house than what he now has. He would like to build a wall around his house as crime is high in the area where he lives. He would like to have the money to hire a couple of employees so he can continue to work in agriculture. He knows that the loan is an obligation but he also knows that this is the only way to achieve his dreams and improve his financial situation and have a better living standard."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1520975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to plant 7000 square meters of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-04T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-06T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146342}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T21:04:22Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":665211,"name":"Lilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilia previously accessed an 30,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase recyclable materials needed in her business.

","en":"Mavjuda is a 40 year-old woman from the Bohtar district.  She is a mother of three sons.  Her husband is presently away from the family for work.  Mavjuda, just like all country women, is involved in agriculture and animal husbandry.  She has been involved in animal husbandry for 5 years.

Burul has a higher education and works a supervisor at the village government, but the salary is not enough to provide the whole family with all of the necessities. To provide a secondary income for her family, Burul is involved in animal husbandry, having started 22 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 4 dairy cows, 1 horse and 14 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 17,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Burul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a horse in order to increase livestock headcount. Burul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's future

story:\r\n\r\nLast year I studied the preparatory \u201cNew Generation Academy\u201d program at AUCA. I had heard a lot of nice feedback about this University and last year I had a chance to check it out myself. I loved the way of teaching, being involved in the abundance of different competitions and concerts, the international atmosphere among the students and staff, the modern lab and cafeterias. My goal is to extent last year for four more years and get a BA degree at AUCA.\r\n\r\nOne of the people who influenced me while choosing my future University is my cousin. She successfully graduated from AUCA and now she works in an elite company. She mastered two foreign languages, met a lot of international friends and went to many countries on different continents. Her achievements and my assurance give me hope to realize my dream.\r\n\r\nI already have part-time work but it is not enough to cover the whole sum of my tuition. I hope to get a Kiva loan and study at one of the best and the most respectable universities in Central Asia.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1523515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

field of study that I chose is Software Engineering. This profession really suits my personality, abilities and goals. I am really interested in the Information Technologies area. I know programs such as Delphi (Turbo Pascal), FL Studio, 3Ds Max, am familiar with the computer language \u0421++ and so forth. I often create cartoons in Flash animation program. Lately, I have been busy making a short film in Adobe After Effects. I have good cognition skills and a test on the internet showed that my IQ is 145.\r\n\r\nOne of my goals is to secure my knowledge and to fill in the knowledge gaps missed in computer technologies. Besides becoming a good specialist in this field, I could raise the level of animators and cinematographs in Kyrgyzstan. This would enrich the country and move it towards development and improvement. As many talented people will be in Kyrgyzstan, how much better and attractive it would be for other countries, which might lead to development.\r\n\r\nI really want to enter American University of Central Asia because this is the only University in our country I have been dreaming of almost my whole life. The reason for that is that this University includes the best and most proficient teachers who provide the necessary information and knowledge, which leads any graduate towards his\/her goals and helps them to achieve it and improve the surroundings. Not the least important fact is that the whole university is like a huge family, where everyone cares about each other. I suppose that it is absolutely not easy to study at AUCA, but I am ready to step on the first rung of a ladder of education and move higher, improve my skills, get new ones and participate in American University's life. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1523516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He has spent all of his savings to buy cast iron to manufacture spare parts and does not have money to fix the lathe machine.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sumaira requested a loan for her husband so that he can repair the lathe machine. She is relaxed now because she hopes that her husband can easily operate his lathe machine again. She is very thankful to Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1523150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machine Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to repair a lathe machine and to buy new tools.

understands why I want to be a sociologist and why I am interested in it. Sociology addresses the most challenging issues of our time. It is a rapidly expanding field whose potential is increasingly tapped by those who craft policies and create programs. Sociologists understand social inequality, patterns of behavior, forces for social change and resistance, and the workings of social systems. It is an exciting discipline with expanding opportunities for a wide range of career paths. Some examples are magazine editor, contract and grants administrator, attorney, personnel manager, probation officer, career counselor, marketing director, and political consultant.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have chosen to study sociology at AUCA. As I am also interested in business, I want to learn how business works through the study of organizations, economic processes, human relations and institutions. AUCA sociology courses cover a wide range of material, and teach analytical skills and flexibility of mind to allow you to see your world in new ways. By itself, it is a broad major for the intellectually curious, and works well as a double major with other narrower degree programs.\r\n\r\nThanks to a Kiva loan, I will be able to get such an education in AUCA and I really hope for the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1523517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She completes her tasks along with her daughters over wooden frames. \r\n\r\nMamtaz wants to sell knitted embroidery directly in the market so that she can generate more profit for her family. She has become an expert in her art and wants to buy raw materials on her own so that she can sell her handmade embroidery for greater profits.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mamtaz has requested a loan to buy raw materials so she can knit more embroidery dresses to sell and generate more income.

By this she will be able to make use of the fact that at this time of the year there is plenty of grain because the farmers are currently collecting their harvest and therefore the prices are low.

She resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land.

aged 44 years and widowed.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also has a bakery for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 pesos in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 30,000 pesos loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMa. Liza dreams that her business will expand even more and hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1523616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-02-04T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-06T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

Homa Bay county is located at the south-western tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people.  There is  a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay county which attracks traders from Ugandan, Tanzania and Kenya.  The traders arrive in boats to sell their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay county means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education. Therefore, school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average.\r\n\r\nEliakim is married and has one child. He is a preacher and a businessman. His wife has a small business cooking and selling donuts. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for ten years  and  grow sunflowers, maize, cowpeas and beans. Eliakim is looking forward to beekeeping because it is a profitable business and it will provide him with honey for food.\r\n\r\nThis is Eliakim\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and he intends to use the proceeds from his beekeeping to expand his business.

She stays at home and besides raising the chickens she manages the household affairs as her sons are not at home and her husband works on the farm. She takes keen interest in her chickens and also generates good income. She usually gets the chicken feeds from the main market and usually buys them in stocks.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of the KIva loan, she will purchase more chicks and raise them. Selling chicken is not a very difficult task. Buyers from the main market come down to the village where Chungyang lives and purchase them in large numbers. Demand is high and supply is insufficient because she could not raise large numbers. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to build a larger coop for expansion of her chicken business. She says, \"Thank you so much, Kiva, for giving me this opportunity to purchase chicks.\u201d She says that she never dreamt that distant friends from the other side of the world would help her someday.

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mango. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.\r\n\r\nPenina is a widow with seven children. She runs a food kiosk and also undertakes farming. She has been farming for 18 years now, and she is currently growing maize, sunflower, butternut, millet and vegetables. Penina is excited about beekeeping as it will earn her some income and provide her with honey for food.\r\n\r\nThis is Penina\u2019s first loan with Honey Care, and she intends to use the proceeds from her beehives to pay for her children\u2019s school fees. Penina\u2019s hope for the future is to expand her beekeeping project and increase her honey production.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":52.99,"image":{"id":1517365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ogongo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2014-02-04T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-06T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Penina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.28,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479451637},{"amount":40.71,"local_amount":3315,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3523.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595182834}],"funded_date":"2014-02-04T21:33:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Irwin","image":672153}},{"id":664135,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ana Maria, comerciante desde hace varios a\u00f1os, ella vende refresco naturales, gaseosas, tortillas, y los fines de semana realiza fritangas, sus hijos la apoyan en el negocio, el creito lo solita para la compra de frutas para los refrescos e ingredientes varios como, azucar, bolsas, ademas comprara maiz para las tortillas y verduras y carnes para las fritangas que realiza, agradce el apoyo que se le ha brindado.","en":"Ms. Ana Maria, a merchant for several years, sells natural beverages, sodas, tortillas, and on the weekends she makes fried food.

Homa Bay county is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, the water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflowers, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.\r\n\r\nMartha is married and has five children. She runs a small food kiosk. Both she and her husband have been farming for ten years now and they are currently growing maize, beans, butternut squash and millet on their farm. Martha is looking forward to beekeeping as it will earn her some income.\r\n\r\nThis is Martha\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. She intends to use the proceeds from her beehives to pay her children\u2019s school fees and renovate her house.

She is studying nursing in order to eventually become a boss and have a stable financial situation.  She chose this profession because she was drawn to it.  She needs the loan from Kiva because her father pay for her schooling, and is not financially solvent.  She enjoys this career, and it will help her get ahead and allow her to help many people in need.  She hopes that upon finishing her training as a nursing assistant, she will find a shop and be able to pay for her education as a head nurse.  \r\n\r\nHer family situation is not very good at the moment.  Her mother has a degenerative disease and her father is the only one who contributes financially in the household.  Her younger brother is also studying and the father must pay a very expensive boarding fee for him.  She has a two year old daughter, and as she is not working, her father must support her as well.  She chose this career due to her mother's illness, so that she may have an idea of how she can help her in the future, and to be able to have some financial stability for her family and her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe wants to enroll in the university and become a head nurse, increasing her income a little and learning more.  This will help her parents and get her daughter ahead because at her young age, she needs many things.

Homa Bay county is located in southwestern Kenya and borders onto Lake Victoria, the second-largest lake in the world. Populations are dense close to the lake, where many individuals make their living from fishing, and a few work in the small but slowly growing tourism industry. A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nDebora is a widow with six children. She operates a small chemist shop and she is a farmer as well. She has been farming for twenty years now and she is currently growing maize, sunflower, beans, millet and groundnuts. She is excited about beekeeping as it will provide her with honey for medicinal use, especially in treating coughs, and because it will earn her some income.\r\n\r\nThis is Debora\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. She plans to use the income from her beehives to expand her chemist business. Debora dearly appreciates the Kiva lenders because by their good will, they will enable her to realize her hope for the future, which is to have a healthy family and to improve her lifestyle. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":12.28,"image":{"id":1517335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ogongo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2014-02-04T16:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-06T16:00:06Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.28,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479451644}],"funded_date":"2014-02-04T18:13:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":665383,"name":"Parveen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parveen is a 41-year-old woman, residing in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

He is single and lives with his mother and a son who goes to the local school.  He works as a mason, a trade that he learned because his family was very humble and of few resources.  He left school in order to help his family financially, and support his younger siblings in their studies.  In addition to this, he also works in agriculture, which he learned from his father who was not only his teacher in this field but also in masonry.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Credicampo will be used to expand a chicken farm that he uses to gain additional income for his family.  While he works in agriculture and as a mason, his mother takes care of the chickens, allowing him to save in labor while still properly caring for his animals.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, he wishes to have a bigger farm that will be more profitable, so that his earnings are greater.  He also wishes that his family, and especially his mother, will be able to relax in their last days as she is of an advanced age and he thinks it is unfair that she worked so hard when she was young to afford him an education, and now that he can, he wants to see her at home relaxing and pay her back for all of her effort."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1521623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"expand a chicken farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-04T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-06T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Evenor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":48.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":57.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":58.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":63.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":65.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":72.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":49.88,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":49.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088666},{"amount":48.64,"local_amount":48.64,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":48.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902972},{"amount":45.39,"local_amount":45.39,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":45.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216165},{"amount":856.09,"local_amount":856.09,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":856.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817515}],"funded_date":"2014-02-26T23:27:17Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:36:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Roberto Henry"}},{"id":665384,"name":"Tehran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tehran is a 55-year-old refugee.

Homa Bay County is located at the south-western tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three East African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people, and a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay county often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay county means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region place a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average.\r\n\r\nMannaseh is married and has eight children. He is a lay leader in church while his wife is a retired community worker in adult education. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for forty years now and they are currently growing vegetables, groundnuts, maize and green grams in their farm. Mannaseh is looking forward to beekeeping because it does not require much effort like other farming enterprises and at the same time it will earn him some income.\r\n\r\nThis is Mannaseh's first loan with Honey Care and he intends to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay his children\u2019s school fees and provide for his family\u2019s basic needs. Mannaseh's hope for the future is to expand his beekeeping project and produce more

This is the family's main source of income, and he gets about 130AZN monthly. He gets a little additional earnings from raising hens and working as a laborer in his free time.\r\n\r\nPeople living in IDP settlements have a high demand for fresh foods. They prepare different kinds of fruit juice and jams. They like eating jam with bread and tea in the morning, or for eating with tea when they have guests. \r\n\r\nThe area of this settlement is very rainy and cold and it\u2019s hard for Mushviq to keep his trees warm. That\u2019s why he applied for a 1,000 AZN loan in order to buy new fertilizers and to build a small greenhouse for his trees.

of Andres, a young student and nursing assistant who is finalizing his basic studies at only 16 years old. He lives with his younger sister and mother, a woman who strives to educate and lift up her children - a woman who, despite all obstacles, has made it possible for her children to achieve their goals. She lives in a humble house where they pay rent and experience a low economic situation. This prevents his family from being able to purchase desirable things; but regardless, Andres' mother does whatever she can to give her children what they need. Andres, once he realized what his mother has done to improve their lives, made the decision to begin studying, which his mother thinks is wonderful. Given their economic situation, according to her, this would be best. He has only a few months until graduating from high school, and this degree will help him be able to pay for higher education, perhaps to become a doctor. This is Andres' biggest dream, to be an excellent medical surgeon. He decided to start as a nursing assistant, which is what he chose to study. He is very happy with this, and once he completes this degree, he will be able to help his mother and pay for his own studies. But unfortunately, Andres and his family have been in a situation where he must make a definitive decision, which would be just as sad for him as it would be for his mother. Andres might have to stop pursuing his nursing degree due to the degrading economy, so he thought of the option to search for an institution through Kiva that might help him continue his studies, achieve his dreams, and become who he has always wanted to be.

They know one another as neighbors, through ties of kinship, and through the income-generating activities they conduct in the village. As a group, they sell millet and provide restaurant services. \r\n\r\nTo bolster their working capital, the members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance organization. This is their 2nd group loan. Mrs. Mamou, 1st from the left, plans to use her loan to buy 3 sacks of millet to meet customer demand. She sells for cash only, to a mixed clientele, from her home and at the village market.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. Mamou expects to earn an average monthly profit of 15,000 FCFA. She will use this profit to handle part of the household expenses and to assist her husband.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1523681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy millet for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Banankoroniwere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-02-04T17:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-06T17:30:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hindja                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata  Fadou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":34395.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220767},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-23T09:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":34395.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045670},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":34395.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263513},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34395.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960391},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":34395.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504676809},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":34395.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676497}],"funded_date":"2014-02-04T21:42:29Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T16:56:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":664154,"name":"Carlos Agustin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos, es soltera, tiene 1 hijo vive con sus padres en el Cant\u00f3n Chimbo Provincia Bol\u00edvar.\nCarlos es empleado privado en la Corporaci\u00f3n La Favorita.

She has not crossed her arms and decided to quit, though; instead, she is studying middle education (Bachelor's degree). Though she did not possess sufficient resources to continue her studies, she wishes to return to continue educating herself and have better opportunities for work. She is married, and her husband is a hairdresser. She has two children who are currently in school. \r\n\r\nShe works as a saleswoman for beauty products through a catalog. She goes from house to house and receives orders from repeat clients. She has worked in this business for 5 years and says there isn't much to be earned through this work. In the end, though, there are not many opportunities for employment, and this job pays more than what her husband makes in the hair salon. These wages help them manage their situation. \r\n\r\nShe sells beauty products every day after 12 PM, because in the morning she has to send her children to school and take care of the household chores. \r\n\r\nRoxana needs this loan to take advantage of the opportunity that has been presented to her. She sells merchandise for the business at a low cost, but doesn't count on this money, because if it takes too long, it could be that another person purchases it and the opportunity she just had is now lost. This is why she decided to take out this loan, which previously was impeding her opportunity to generate sales. \r\n\r\nHer main dream is to continue her studies, but it is clear that to be able to cover costs, she has to work hard and save. But it is decided what she wants to accomplish in the near future.

He is 34 years old.  Kuzrat is a responsible husband, father of two children, shepherd and honest man, working for the good of his family.  Kuzrat's wife works as a teacher at a school.  Kuzrat is involved in animal husbandry.  One of the reasons for choosing this profession is the fact that the nature and climate of the Shahrituz district, where he is from, is favorable for a healthy animal development.  Kuzrat has been working in the animal husbandry not for long, but already knows all of the nuances of this business.  Kuzrat decided to increase his livestock headcount because expanding his business means increasing his income.  But he needs money to buy livestock.  Kuzrat does not have enough money and this is why he requested this loan with the hope that he will be helped.

She belongs to a poor family, and it is very difficult for her to fulfill all the household expenses with poor earnings. In fact, her husband is a hawker by profession, and sells different kinds of hair oils using his bicycle.  He sells avocado oil, castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, safflower oil etc. He calls loudly to the consumers and is famous for offering all these hair oils to protect hair from falling out. He wants to buy a large quantity of hair oil to sell to expand his business, and to overcome the poverty.  Therefore, Reeta requested a loan for her husband, so that he can buy more quantities of hair oils.  Reeta is very impressed with this honorable support.

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, and borders onto Lake Victoria, the second-largest lake in the world. Populations are dense close to the lake, where many individuals make their living from fishing, and a few work in the small, but slowly growing, tourism industry. A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nMary is married and has four children. She runs a small business of selling grains while her husband is a retired construction worker. Both she and her husband are farmers. They have been farming for fourteen years now and they are currently growing maize, beans, soy beans and millet. Mary is excited about beekeeping as it will earn her some income and provide her with honey for food.\r\n\r\nThis is Mary\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and she intends to use the proceeds from her beehives to pay school fees for her children and provide for her family\u2019s basic needs. Mary\u2019s hope for the future is to expand her beekeeping

With this loan, he will buy fertilizers and other products that he will apply at planting time to assure a good germination. He will also buy high quality bean seeds that take well to the soil conditions and fertility. Finally, he will pay the labor costs that he requires to prepare the land, apply the products, and do the planting after the land is ready. This will help him to ensure the job is well done. He hopes to take advantage of the good climate and soil conditions in his area for the planting and also take advantage of his years of experience managing staple grains.\r\n\r\nApart from being able to buy the highest quality products so that his crop will be both well developed and healthy and produce a bountiful harvest, he also hopes for a good production in the short term.  He hopes to apply the income from this harvest for the well being and education of his families, as well as meet other family goals and continue investing in his cultivation.

She also comments that one\u2019s job may be small and difficult but the other members are very inspired because despite her irregular and meager income, she is able to support her seven kids and get them settled down.\r\n \r\nShe weaves all traditional woven clothes including women's wrap-around skirts and men\u2019s shawls. Her finished woven clothes are highly in demand in the village and nearby villages. The demand is greater during the wedding season and for cultural fests. With the Kiva loan, she is planning to purchase better, good quality yarn and silk threads to weave expensive woven clothes to sell. She is hopeful that she will be able to make a profitable investment. \r\n\r\nShe says, \"Thank-you so much Kiva\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in a piggery, a poultry

They average 37 years of age and four children each. They all live in the village of Banankoroniwere, in the region of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). They know one another as neighbors, through ties of kinship, and through the income-generating activities they conduct in the village. As a group, they sell sugar and millet, and they provide restaurant services. \r\n\r\nTo bolster their working capital and diversify their activities, the members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance organization. This is their 7th group loan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Assitan, standing in the center of the photo, is a reseller of sugar in Banankoroniwere and surrounding areas. She plans to use her loan to buy 3 sacks of sugar. She sells for cash to a mixed clientele, from her home and at the village market.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. Assitan expects to earn an average monthly profit of 25,000 FCFA. She will use this profit to handle part of the household expenses and to cover her children\u2019s tuition fees.

He lives in a village about six km from the nearest city. He has rented a home with his wife since they got married three years ago, and they have a two year old son. Their son's a fighter: he just had a lip surgery done due to a birth defect. His wife works as a housekeeper from Monday to Friday, and on Saturday and Sunday, she takes distance-learning classes at an institute in the city. Eli grew up with his parents. He is the oldest of five brothers who have always been farmers and vegetable growers. He studied through the third grade at a local school. He's been working since he was ten years old. He learned to plant corn and beans from his father, and he grew up planting vegetables. When he got married, he decided to take up growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and green beans, as these are profitable crops in his area and help him earn money for his household.\r\n\r\nHe plants 3500 sq. meters of vegetables in his community, working every day from 6:00 in the morning until 4:00 in the afternoon. His wife helps him tend to the smaller parcels of land. He is asking for a loan from Credicampo to invest $250 in buying farming supplies so he can plant a parcel in cucumbers. He also needs another $200 for planting green beans. The rest he will use to buy wood and tile as there are some repairs he needs to make to his home. Eli dreams of building his own home in the village, though it would be of adobe. He is also planning to expand the area he plants a little at a time. He wishes to keep supporting his wife in her studies and be able to provide a better life for his

Like-minded women folk from the same village joined hands and formed the group. They stood as one and support one another in times of need. The village is located about 35 kms from the main capital town of Manipur, and it is one of the northeastern states in India.\r\n\r\nMedha usually purchases yarn, thread and silk thread from the main market, and weaves. She uses a loom for weaving, as it is more productive and profitable. She supplies in bulk to the women\u2019s market in the main market and gets paid. The demand is high during the wedding season, which generally falls in the month of March until July, and that is the peak season for her weaving business.  \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more stock of yarn in different colours, silk thread and weave.

After her husband\u2019s death, she had to raise two children on her own. Her eldest son transports passengers to nearby towns. Her daughter helps out in the household. Aichurok has received vocational education. As a main source of income for her family, Aichurok is raising livestock, having launched this business 18 years ago by buying farm animals for 8,000 KGS. Thanks to Aichurok\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes six dairy cows. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Aichurok has turned to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution in order to increase her  cattle headcount by buying heifers. Aichurok plans to use the income from her loan for an additional expansion of livestock, and also plans to save for building a new

Borrowing from moneylenders was the only option available to let their kids pursue their studies. \n\nNeichong sells used garments, and her husband works in a private sector where the income is small and insufficient.\n\nWith the Kiva loan, she is providing admission fees, a set of school uniforms, textbooks, stationery supplies, and tuition fees for the whole year. She is so happy that her daughter can attend the school and not worry about the examination fees and others. She says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva.\u201d She will also try to repay the loan on time and will work very hard to keep their kids pursuing their studies, and give them a better future.

Depending on the meager income generated from running a small grocery shop in the neighbourhood is difficult when you have five school-going kids.  The headache of the monthly fees is more when annual exams are to be held. Paying the monthly fees on a regular basis is difficult because at the beginning of the year, she usually gets money from money lenders at a high interest rate so that the kids don\u2019t miss the session. But this usually paralyses her when its time to pay the monthly fees again. She is delighted to avail the loan from Kiva and says that she will repay the loan on time. She says, \u201cThank-you so much Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful gift\u201d and she will always remain obliged for their help and assistance. The rest of the members are doing the same by providing admission fees, annual fees and other necessary educational expenses.
