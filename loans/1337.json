He says that his first term of studies was a great adventure. He and his co-students are satisfied with the work they carried out during the term. Each teacher taught in his own way, but Sebastian learnt that cookery is a matter of love and of interest; that there are a variety of styles and modes, and that this depends on the chef, but that they all share the qualities of creativity and love for the work. He realised during the term that the course is definitely quite extensive, but that with a programme as interesting as this one, he could achieve a lot through effort and dedication. He began to be struck as a young child by everything related to cookery and slowly began to practise at home, preparing basic things. However, when he went to the institute, it opened his mind and opened up his creativity. He devoted determination and love to it despite his daily work and he did everything he could to carry out his studies at night and complete the course as he wanted to do.<br \/><br \/>Now Sebastian feels anxious to return to his studies, because the second term he is about to enter will be packed with new experiences and a great deal of  gastronomical know-how. They learn new things daily and it is the best way of falling in love with the world through the variety of food that exists. To know and learn are two of the pleasures of life, but more than pleasure is the doing, the creating and the realisation of what one enjoys, no matter the place or the hour. He is always learning on the way from home to work, to the university or to the institute where he studies, and Sebastian knows that the way ahead is filled with one problem or another.

She has a high school-level eduction, and her main source of income is farming -- more specifically, the greenhouse business and animal husbandry, which she started 18 years ago with 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Odinakhon now has one dairy cow and 1.45 hectares of land. There are greenhouses on her land, in which she grows early cucumbers, tomatoes, and cabbage for household consumption and for sale. <br \/><br \/>Odinakhon's monthly income is 17,000 KGS. In order to grow her business, Odinakhon is requesting a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners to buy cucumber and tomato seeds, as well as mineral fertilizers to prepare the soil. Odinakhon plans to use the resulting income to build an additional greenhouse in her courtyard, and wants to save enough money to pay for her son's wedding celebration."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1521982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He works six hours per day, all week. Denis is the father of two children and he hopes to give his children all the best in life. The reason he started his business in 1994 was to earn income which he would use to cater for the family's needs. The business is located in Kichwamba in Bunyaruguru, and his clients are mainly people from Katunguru and Kichwamba counties. \n\nDenis would like to use the money (One million Five Hundred Thousand shillings only) to buy more jerry cans of local brew, which he hopes to sell at a profit, which will him help him to expand his business. \nTo get more income, Denis also does some coffee farming. Denis' main challenge are the people who never pay their debts and this lessens his business profits. Despite the challenges faced in the business, Denis is hopeful that he will expand his business, especially after getting support in the form of a loan and financial education from

Yet, he can hardly meet the family's expenses.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn more profit from this agribusiness, they want to start potato cultivation on their farmland.  Rabeya heard about BJS and has taken a loan to help her husband to buy potato seeds and good quality fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThey hope this new business will provide them earn an additional profit, which

They live in large traditional families in the Massablacoura neighborhood in the city of Bougouni. They know one another through neighborhood, friendship and business ties. To reinforce their financial capacity in order to better run their business, they joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, with whom they are on their fifth loan.

She was born on 10 September in Bogot\u00e1.  From birth until the age of 7 she lived with her mother in her parents' house.  She started going to school when she was 2, and attended Las Alejandritas Preschool until she was ready for elementary school.  When Adriana was 6 her mother started a home with another man in Ibagu\u00e9 Tolima and had two more children.\r\n\r\nWhen Adriana was 7, her grandparents realized it wasn't the best environment for her and assumed the responsibility of taking her to Tibana Boyac\u00e1 to live and go to school in the town.  In second and third grades she participated in the math olympics and took first place in the department.  Adriana studied up to fourth grade there, until she was 10, when they returned to Bogot\u00e1 from the farm for health reasons.  She started the fifth year of elementary school in San Vicente Ferrer, a private school, and finished her intermediate studies in the district school, Juan Lozano.\r\n\r\nCurrently Adriana's in 11th grade and has started studying English in the afternoon so she can improve her academic status.  She also wants to get a technical degree in addition to her diploma, so she wants to study automotive mechanics at Campo Alto because cars are her passion.  She wants to learn about them inside and out, how they have progressed through time and how they might be in the future.\r\n\r\nAdriana hopes this program will help her realize her dream of getting into the national university to study mechanical engineering.  She wants to work with cars, not as a mechanic but as something more important.\r\n\r\nAdriana's going to move up little by little until she reaches her goal.  This is why she needs Kiva's help to pay for her advanced studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1523375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay her tuition for a semester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-06T01:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-08T01:50:04Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":131130.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069774},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":131130.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882719},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":131130.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202083},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":131130.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286224},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":131130.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224931}],"funded_date":"2014-02-06T05:22:04Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":665458,"name":"Jhon Jairo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl es jhon jairo, se considera una persona con muchas capacidades y con ganas de salir adelante para hacerlo, debe proponerse metas y estudiar en campo alto es una de ellas en el programa que se matriculo  ENSAMBLE Y REPARACI\u00d3N DE HARDWARE , se decidi\u00f3 a estudiar este programa, primero porque le gusta y segundo porque es una excelente fuente de empleo y porque no,  colocar un negocio propio, le gusta porque le llama la atenci\u00f3n sistemas y  todo sobre la tecnolog\u00eda y que mejor que empezar con este programa ya que le va ampliar los conocimientos  y adem\u00e1s le va abrir muchas puertas para as\u00ed  mas adelante realizar la carrera profesional que es ingenier\u00eda de sistemas,  sabe que es un buen comienzo con el apoyo que ustedes CAMPO ALTO Y KIVA les brinda a muchas personas que tiene dificultades econ\u00f3micas para pagar el semestre, con ayuda de estas dos entidades \u00e9l sabe que puede lograr lo que se propone. \nSi ustedes le otorgan este subsidio \u00e9l lo  recibir\u00e1 con mucha gratitud y dar\u00e1 lo mejor de s\u00ed mismo.  \n","en":"This is Jhon Jairo and he is a considered a person with many skills and with big dreams to get ahead.

The members of this communal bank have various businesses such as harvesting and selling garlic, dent removal and painting for vehicles, wool handcrafts, selling plumbing and welding supplies by catalog, and others. \r\n\r\nAndrea has a bookstore and sweetshop where she also has binding, laminating and photocopying services. She has had her business for five years, she started it when her husband lost his job and she found a half-day job that didn't pay much. She saved a little from this money and with that saved money she could start buying little things to start setting up the business. Recently her husband has again found himself out of work, so she must again focus on helping her family with the money she makes. But she faces a challenge of trying to get a machine for printing passport-sized photos, since on the island where she lives there is no such machine.\r\n\r\nThe money she is requesting is to buy spiral binding, laminate, and products for her bookstore and sweetshop. She knows that it will work out well for her since she has been able to give peace to the people who live with her, becasue her business is the only one nearby to get photocopies. She is very happy and grateful for the help that Fondo Esperanza has given her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1522244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

Lara would like to tell a little about his life.

He is facing life\u2019s financial needs and he needs to go to work to forge a rewarding future.\r\n\r\nJaime needs to find a new path where he can realize his goals, so he spoke to a sister who also recently began working toward a short career effort.  She spoke to him about the school where she was in her second semester of pharmacy studies and Jaime saw this as an opportunity to begin what he was looking for, so he started the first semester.

The journey began while Alicia was a student at the New York University School of Law living in the West Village where she fell in love with fashion.  During her study breaks, she would purchase her favorite sweet, a vanilla cupcake, and walk the streets of SoHo.  During her walk, she was captivated by how people transcended fashion trends by inserting their own personal styles.  Each person's style expressed a different voice.   After graduating from NYU Law, Alicia worked as a Corporate Securities Associate for a Top 100 law firm. When Alici's schedule allowed, she would do what she loved to do so much in law school, take strolls in the city, eating my favorite vanilla cupcake, and shop for my other favorite, shoes. On one of these occasions, she had an \u201cAh-Ha\u201d moment: \"Why can\u2019t a girl buy two of her favorite things-cupcakes and shoes-from one place at the same time?\" A sweet idea was born, Cupcake Stiletto. Inspired by Alicia's lifelong passion for baking taught by her father and her love for fashion, indie designers and shoes, she created the concept of a \u2018Shoecakery,\u2019 a retail establishment that sells cupcakes and shoes.

Because of difficulties in life, she was not able to send her first child to college, so he joined the army. She's tried to make it up for the younger one by working hard to earn money to pay tuition fees for him. Formerly, besides cultivating rice, vegetables and rasing chickens, she collected firewood for sale. Presently, she not only expands her agriculture activities by breeding fish, pigs, but also works in a  restaurant and a store. However, she's facing difficulties because she lacks water for living and irrigation. She also encounters capital deficiencies, but because her family is no longer considered as a poor household, she doesn't get much support from the government. \r\n\r\nShe wants a loan from ACE to buy food for fish and hope that through this loan as well as ACE training lessons, she could improve her income and have the ability to pay tuition fees for her child and rebuild the

He would like to use the loan money of one million five hundred thousand shillings(1,500,000) to buy pigs for slaughtering on Saturdays so that he can make improved sales and hence earn more profits. \r\n\r\nHis clients are people who visit the rural market on Saturdays and he believes that if he gets more money he will get more customers and hence the business will expand. Inadequate capital is the main challenge he has but with the UGAFODE loan, he believes it will be a challenge no more"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1524926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pigs for slaughter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-02-06T21:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-08T21:30:09Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T15:58:01Z","rounded_local_amount":128645.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459234036},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":128645.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468059480},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":128645.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479277316},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":128645.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490973901},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":128645.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504414947},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":128645.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692536},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":128645.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530922773},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":128645.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542676196},{"amount":206.94,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":514583.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":561809822}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T06:21:09Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T15:33:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":666222,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200.28,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase more cooking oil, rice, and cooking seasoning, to expand her business.

She is 24 years old and has an education up to grade 8. Her husband, Ranjit, aged 30 years, attended school up to grade 8. They have three children (one son and two daughters). Two of them are receiving education (in grade 4 and grade 1). The third one is below school-going age. They live in their own kachha house (mud, straw and bamboo-made) in the small village, Patkidaha, in Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nShyamali's husband is a mason by profession. For more than ten years, he has been involved in this profession. But of late, he has had to face competitors, because of which his income is not as much as expected by him, and is not sufficient to cover all the needs of their family.  \r\n\r\nShyamali is also a very energetic, hardworking and optimistic woman. She wants to overcome the financial hurdles. She runs an animal husbandry.  At present, there are one milk cow and two goats. She works hard there, after managing her household work. She sells milk in her locality, yet they are unable to give the family a decent lifestyle.\r\n\r\nShyamali wants to expand her business to more effectively meet the daily costs of her family. She heard about BJS and has taken a loan from them to purchase a dairy cow. She wants to start a dairy products business. One more cow means more milk, thus more profit. \r\n\r\nHer plans are to make dairy products from the milk, such as butter, cheese, paneer, etc., and to sell the products in the local market with the help of her husband. She hopes this business will help her to generate additional income, as the products are in great demand in the market. The profit will help her to improve her living conditions, and she can give her children proper education.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she aspires to purchase more cows to expand her business. She and her husband give their full thanks to BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1524946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow to start a dairy products business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-02-06T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-08T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shyamali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-02-07T02:55:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":666246,"name":"Muattar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muattar is a young woman with great new ideas.

She works four days a week and twelve hours per day. The business is located in a rural area in Ward 11 - Mitooma sub-county. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to use the loan of two million shillings only to buy bales of clothes, which she will sell at a profit. Local people and traders are her main clients. She hopes to serve them with a variety of clothes if she gets the loan, and she has hopes that this will increase her profits, which will help her to educate her children. \r\n\r\nLack of enough capital is what challenges her most, but she hopes that it will cease to be a challenge if the loan is granted.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1525000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

The group is made up of three women, all of whom are married, and who on average are 30 years old and have two children. They live in traditional families in the Dansoman neighborhood in the city of Accra. They know one another through neighborhood, friendship, and business ties. \r\n\r\nTo strengthen their financial capacity in order to better run their businesses, they joined ID-Ghana, a micro finance institution, with whom they are on their eighth loan. The previous two loans were repaid back properly.

He works seven days in a week and six hours per day. Emmanuel also has a  hardware shop in Kashenshero, which is attended to by a different person and the shop gives him additional income. He would like to use the money to buy mulche for the farm using the two million five hundred thousand shillings so that he can have better yields. His clients are mainly coffee traders in the area and he hopes to serve them better if the loan is granted. Emmanuel is mainly challenged by competition from other farmers, but he hopes to give good quality coffee to the trader so that he can out compete the other

an objective of getting a clear source of income which he would use to cater for his family members. He works six days per week and works eight hours per day. Tea farming is his major source of income and he hopes to expand it so that it gives him enough profits which he would use to pay school fees for his three children who are all in school.

The people of this area raise and sell both young animals and cattle for meat and milk. Gloria is 23 years old. She is married, and she and her husband and their two children live in their own little home that they've had for a few years.\r\n\r\nShe's very satisfied to be helping her husband with the household expenses and to be able to support the home activities with her business. She learned her work very young, and since then she has been in the business of producing milk and raising animals. In spite of all their needs, she has gotten ahead and now she wants to have her own cattle. Through the efforts of her parents, she was able to complete primary and secondary school, but due to her family's difficult economic situation, she had to begin working very young and become a supporter of herself and her family.\r\n\r\nThe work she learned is very common in this area, as it's a rural area.

She works six days per week and works an average of nine hours per day, which gives her enough time for her customers. She started the business in 2008 with high hopes that the profits from the business would sustain her and her family members, but the stiff competition in her area of operation has hindered this. However, she has applied for a loan of three million shillings so that she can buy more stock items. This will help her to beat her competitors since she will have a variety of items that will attract more customers to her. Her clients are mainly students of Kampala International University and other middle-aged people in Ishaka town. She hopes to retain her clientele if the loan is given since she will restock the shop and meet her clients' needs. Sidonah is hopeful that if she restocks the shop and keeps being the hardworking person she has always been, she will expand her business, which has always been her dream in

He lives with his wife and one year old son in a town called Kitwe, located in the Copperbelt province of Zambia. He provides financial services to people in his community through mobile money transfers. He had a full-time job but began his mobile money transfer business because his salary was not high enough to support his family's needs. He currently employs one person. Joseph describes himself as hardworking and friendly. He enjoys running his business because it is easy to operate and a reliable way for him to provide for his family. \r\n\r\nThis is the first time Joseph is taking out a loan. He has requested a Kiva loan to boost his working capital.

Another problem is inadequate capital to properly manage a business of his own.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will buy seedlings, pay for labor, buy piglets and bags of feed for his pigs. He will also invest in poultry farming- he will buy one week old and two week old chicks and buy medicine for the fowl. \r\n\r\nHe holds a positive view of his business succeeding because he has been doing it for a long time and as such, has experience in the business. Also he has customers who buy from him regularly, and his business is situated just around town which eases the marketing of the products. The demand for chicken is high in town, due to the ever increasing populations. With this business activity, the community will benefit from good quality fowl and a reduction in prices and an increase in the food supply. The community will not have to travel long distances to buy food.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, he will increase his business, educate his children, pay all his hospital bills, provide three square meals to his family, expand his business, and support all village developments. He prefers GHAPE loans because of their low interest rates with convenient repayment intervals, and also because their members are trained before the loan is disbursed. Finally, the social needs of members is a concern to GHAPE.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1525125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy seedlings and to pay for farm work, piglets, and feed for his poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

Their daughter is married and the two older sons work as loaders at a restaurant in Russia and send part of their salary to the parents in Kyrgyzstan, and the youngest son is a school student.  Her husband Abylkasym is a farmer with a lot of experience. Shakhadat has a secondary education.  To provide the primary income for her family, Shakhadat is involved in animal husbandry, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 bull and 1 sheep. She has all of the conditions for keeping livestock.  Feed and hay have been stocked up.  Shakhadat also has a small 0.70 hectare land plot, where she annually grows potatoes and carrots for use within the business and sale.  From March through November, Shakhadat sells milk products, such as butter, kurut and kefir.  The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Shakhadat requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a cow in order to increase livestock headcount and increase the monthly income from selling milk products.

The son is a school student and daughter is 4 years old. Her husband is a teacher at a local school. Mairamkul has a higher education and works as a teacher, but unfortunately her salary is not enough to support the family. To provide an additional income for her family, Mairamkul is involved in animal husbandry, having started 9 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 7,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows. She has all of the conditions for keeping livestock. Feed and hay have been stocked up. Mairamkul also has a small 0.90 hectare land plot, where she annually grows barley and potatoes for use within the business and sale. Mairamkul sells milk and has an additional income.

One sunny day, which was on a Wednesday to be exact, she enrolled in the Health Administration program at CampoAlto with great determination to make her dream a reality.  Lilian worked all week and studying would have to take place on Saturdays.  She was also experiencing difficulties, receiving words of caution, and overcoming financial obstacles.  Lilian applied for a loan so that she could begin her classes.  Once she was approved, she was able to achieve the financial stability required to attend the institute of her choice.  She was able to make her Saturdays available so that she could embark on this phase of her life and pursue the field that she wanted to study.  Reasons beyond her control had prevented this from happening in the past.  Lilian finished the semester with very good grades.  <br \/><br \/>At the beginning of the following year, Lilian became unemployed.  However, she decided to continue down this new path in her life and start an apprenticeship that would provide new professional opportunities and give her the chance to reinvent herself.  She could pursue a new dream with the support of the people she loves.  Days before, Lilian decided to do whatever it took to get her initial payment reduced.  Not taking into account her other fees, she did not want to pass up the opportunity to become independent and create new opportunities to serve others and improve the quality of life for them as well as herself.<br \/><br \/>Unemployed and without any money, she decided to enroll at CampoAlto with the help of a Kiva loan.  This would make it possible for her to start the semester with a reduced payment, which means she would only have to withdraw a small amount of her own funds.  Going forward, Lilian expects to continue her studies and embark on this phase of her life alongside her partner.  She hopes to gain a great deal of knowledge and, most importantly, become a successful health administrator in the future.  <br \/><br \/>Lilian is extremely grateful for this opportunity.  She needs this loan because she hopes to make this great dream a reality.  Lilian asks for assistance and support as she pursues this great goal of becoming a person who can grow professionally.  Most importantly, she hopes to achieve a better quality of life and the great satisfaction of learning through each of her classes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1523818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-07T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-09T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069785},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882731},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":291495.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202095},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286236},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224943}],"funded_date":"2014-02-07T14:45:54Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":665570,"name":"Rosa Guillermina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Rosa esta realizando su segundo cr\u00e9dito en el grupo de cr\u00e9dito La Paz, vive en la ciudad de Cuenca, esta ciudad se encuentra rodeada de monta\u00f1as gracias a su geograf\u00eda accidentada, desde Diciembre de 1999 es Patrimonio Cultural de la Humanidad, cuenta con bellos lugares para visitar y disfrutar de la naturaleza, es cuna de grandes artistas, escritores y deportistas, su gente es amable, gentil y aun mantienen la cultura y tradiciones de sus pueblos.\nLa Se\u00f1ora Rosa tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y fruto de su uni\u00f3n conyugal ha concebido una hija de 6 a\u00f1os que est\u00e1 estudiando en una escuelita de la ciudad, est\u00e1 muy emocionada ya que se encuentra embarazada de 2 meses, su esposo labora como mec\u00e1nico, no tienen casa propia por lo que viven arrendando.\nDo\u00f1a Rosa labora de domingo a domingo sin un horario fijo en la venta de granos cocinados, este empezando con este negocio ya que lleva reci\u00e9n 3 meses y poco a poco va tenido clientela.

Her grandfather became ill and she said to him \"Don't worry Grandfather, I'm going to make you better because I'm going to be the nurse.\" Her grandfather, touched, thanked her, and every day she was anxious about him. She wanted to get him better quickly but she thought of how they took her grandfather to hospital and she started her studies to be able to help her grandfather in the future.\r\n\r\nThe girl grew up until she finished school and decided to continue her studies. As an assistant nurse, she wanted to reach the goals she had dreamed of since she was small and so she started to study nursing. As a nurse she would be able to help her family, but there are also people who need her, other families.\r\n\r\nTime passed and she is sensibly continuing to study nursing, because it is the career that she likes and wants to study, and which today she practices. She also thought that it was something that could help her in the job market and that it it would make it easy for her to find a good job.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a Kiva loan mainly because the repayments seemed very good for her. Getting money is just a little difficult as her mother doesn't work and she has to turn to her uncles for help. Also, she does not earn enough from her jobs to cover the monthly bills. If she gets this loan it will be even easier for her to study and pay her bills.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1524048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester's tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-07T11:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-09T11:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069796},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882742},{"amount":141.68,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-31T08:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":291495.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202106},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286247},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224954}],"funded_date":"2014-02-07T14:51:23Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":665137,"name":"Yamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ms. Yamileth is 46 years old, married, and the mother of three children, all of whom are already professional due to the support they received from the husband of Dona Yamileth to finish their studies.

She wants to continue and be able to finish her schooling. She doesn't have a stable job and working the hours she does is not enough to be able to help out in the home and pay for her schooling.

Due to the current bad situation in Yemen, he has less profit from his enterprise.  So, he took a loan of 200,000 Yemeni Rial (YER) from AMB to stock his business with grocery products so that his customers will always find what they need and keep coming back.

She is the leader of the group. She is uneducated and living in a poor area in Sana`a. Her house is very old and in miserable condition. The house is vulnerable to fall down at any time. It is known that house renovation requires a lot of money. She has started renovating her house, but now she needs more money in order to complete the renovation.
