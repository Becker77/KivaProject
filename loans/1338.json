He owns and drives a tricycle (a motorcycle with a sidecar) that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. He starts working early in the morning until late in the evening. There are times when he drives late evening until the wee hours in order to have bigger profit. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in his transportation business every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting an amount of 8,000 PHP in his loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy motorcycle parts for the maintenance of his tricycle unit. He has to maintain his unit in good condition in order to have a regular income for the daily needs of his family. \r\n\r\nGilbert hopes to buy another unit of tricycle and dreams to have a better living. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, and this is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Two daughters got married, a son is serving in the army, and the remaining two children live with Upinisa and help around the homestead. Upinisa has a secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Upinisa raises livestock and crops, having begun 24 years ago with a livestock purchase of 1,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Upinisa today has on her homestead: one dairy cow with calf, ten sheep, and also a plot of land measuring 0.30 hectares, on which she grows potatoes, corn and carrots. Monthly income amounts to 17,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the aim of further developing her homestead, Upinisa applied to the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan - to purchase cows for fattening and subsequent sale at the market at a premium. Upinisa plans to invest income from the loan in further propagation of the quantity of domestic animals, and intends to collect money for putting on a wedding celebration for her daughter."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1522899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows for fattening and resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochubaev village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-07T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-09T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":103.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Upinisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40332.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463083},{"amount":1096.92,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":60498.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":103.08,"payment_id":610751116}],"funded_date":"2014-02-25T02:21:24Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":666523,"name":"11-04-02 Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Thi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Gi\u1ea3ng has a retail business selling dry food and general items.

","en":"Nurizat is 32, married and raising two school-age children with her spouse. She has a high school education and earns her family's main income through animal husbandry, which she started ten years ago when she purchased cattle for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work Nurizat now has four dairy cows and 15 sheep, and her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

The children all help out around the house. Gulmira has a degree in education and teaches Russian language and literature at the local school. She earns additional income for her family through animal husbandry, which she started 14 years ago when she bought cattle for 5,000 som (KGS).

She graduated from high school in 2012, and since then, wanted to study cosmetology and holistic aesthetics.  Her parents have supported her with a lot of effort because she has always been a good student.  They enrolled her in Campo Alto despite it being an expensive career given the necessary materials.  They supported her for two semesters, but four months ago, one of her parents lost their job and they told her they could no longer financially support her studies since they already had other responsibilities like rent, utilities, and food among others.  Therefore, she desperately searched for a job, but because of her youth and lack of work experience, she has been unable to find a job that would enable her to finish her studies.  \r\n\r\nSince she only has one semester left before graduating her cosmetology and holistic aesthetics program, she is seeking support because her biggest dream is to graduate.  She does not want to abandon her education because she is a responsible and dedicated woman, and in those two semesters, she excelled with great grades and work.  For this reason, she hopes to graduate in July of 2014.

Her daughters are all married, and her oldest son works in Russia, sending a portion of his income back home to her in Kyrgyzstan.  Her youngest daughter is a student.  Gaukhar has the equivalent of a high school education and is a crop and livestock farmer by trade, first starting 29 years ago with 5,000 som worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistence, she currently has a dairy cow, 2 calves, 2 young horses and 25 sheep, as well as a 1-hectare plot of land for growing beans and clover for use on her own farm as well as to sell for a profit.  Her monthly income is 12,000 som.  She has everything she needs to raise livestock, including hay and other fodder prepared for her animals.  \r\n\r\nTo further develop her farm, Gaukhar is seeking a loan from Bai Tushum & Partners to buy sheep.  She hopes this will help her increase her monthly income from producing milk, and plans on setting aside some of the profits due to the loan to buy even more livestock, as well as some new household appliances.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1523165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

Her husband helps her around the house.  Orozbu has a secondary education and she is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this field 30 years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 1,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Orozbu's very hard work, her farming business now consists of thee dairy cows, five horses and ten sheep.  She makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nEager to further develop her business, Orozbu has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" and asked for a loan.  She will use this loan to buy some cows in order to increase her cattle headcount.  She plans to invest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her number of farm animals.  She is also planning to save enough money to buy a new barn for her

She and her husband are raising three children.  She has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides the main source of income for her family.  She started in this field nine years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Muyasarkhan's very hard work, her farming business now consists of three dairy cows and eight sheep.  She makes a monthly income of 11,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nEager to further increase her farming business, Muyasarkhan has turned to the bank Bai Tushum & Partners and asked for a loan.  She will use her loan to buy some sheep, which she will fatten and then resell at a higher price at the market.  She plans to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her number of farm animals.  She is also planning to save enough money to repair her

She is 42 years old and a mother of six children: three daughter and three sons. Currently, three of them are in school, one is too young for school, and the remaining two children are helping in the business. To deal with the family\u2019s hardships, she grows rice on three hectares of land as the main source of income and she raises pigs as a supplementary source of income. She has been involved in her current business for 11 years and it has returned her about 38,800 KHR per day. This is the third loan for Horn with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

She grew up alongside her parents, sister, and maternal grandmother.\r\n\r\nFrom a young age she was a girl with great talents and abilities that helped to shape her as a person and to get good academic results in school.  Her strengths are based in having faith in what she does, an order of ideas, clarity of objectives in life, and the desire to learn more every day for her own benefit.  Her weaknesses are stress and being downcast when not doing anything to solve a problem.\r\n\r\nA little about her family atmosphere:  Her mother is a very responsible woman who gave her everything to study, who supports her, and says that she has to study a lot so that she does not end up working in a supermarket, knowing that this does not require much study.  She wants her to have a lot of work, and to be a good beautician even if she has to push herself physically.  In general, the family asks Paula to improve and take advantage of every opportunity, quality, and attitude, because she is a young woman and from a young age she thought of achieving great things in order to have a future with a stable job, in which she becomes a professional, marries, has a family, has her own house, and has success as a mother and as a family.\r\n\r\nOne of her successes is having been able to finish her bachelor degree with good academic performance and discipline.  Having begun her studies with Campo Alto, she is encouraged to find success in all of her goals.  One of her failures was not moving on to the district college, which compelled her to make quick decisions and continue trying and opening more doors.\r\n\r\nThe plan of action is to take all of the obstacles she has faced and convert them into opportunities to improve, focus her efforts, correct them, and analyze the impediments that are in the way.  She wants to be a beautician who makes her dreams a reality: she will be a successful, modest, humble, and God-fearing person.  Her dreams are to become a professional, to start up a business, have a house, choose a path of study, have a good understanding of the power of mood, immediately correct mistakes, and face obstacles that she sees as full of opportunities.  And she has a positive mentality that she is going to overcome these.\r\n\r\nWhen she sees the success of these objectives and feels the happiness of seeing the fruit of all her efforts, it will be a goal achieved.  The purpose of life is to analyze the situation and make a plan of action, to have a modest state of life, to serve society, to be loving, to have justice, and to continue to fight for what she desires.\r\n\r\nThe reason for which she needs a Kiva loan is because it will help her financially to pay for tuition and monthly fees so that she may be able to continue successfully in the program without delays in payments, and be able to have the class tools since they are a little costly.  It will benefit her in terms of work, personally, and would contribute economically and professionally."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1523870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-08T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-10T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paula Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069789},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882735},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":291495.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202099},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286240},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":145747.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224947}],"funded_date":"2014-02-08T13:41:45Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":666791,"name":"Mohira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohira is a hardworking woman.

To get to school, he had to walk for 25 minutes on mountain paths to shorten the distance. He lives with his parents, his two brothers, and one nephew. Unfortunately, his parents could not continue to support him to study at the secondary school level, because the school was farther away and would have cost much more money.\r\n\r\nThe obligation to sustain the family falls on Elmer, along with the support of his father, who also works in farming and raising small animals. For two years, Elmer has been going to his community church in the afternoons after finishing his work on the farm.\r\n\r\nElmer and his father grow corn, beans, and sorghum. Elmer learned about this work from a young age thanks to his father. He also raises small animals (fattening pigs), and his brothers support him with this labor. He is now working on a water project in his community, where he expects to work for six months.\r\n\r\nHe needs this loan to buy four pigs. He will also buy metal sheets and wood to improve the pigpen where he will keep the pigs to fatten and later sell them.

is a 41-year-old woman of Dhupguri. She has four children who are studying in different classes. Her husband has a clothing business where he sells clothes to the local market, but his income is inconsistent as he takes payment on an installment basis. Due to inconvenient payment receipts, Shipra decided to start a new business of making quilts and blankets with old clothes, sarees, old bed covers, etc., and sells them door to door and to her relatives. She learned this art from her mother in childhood. Now she is applying this art to give financial assistance to her family as well as to her husband.\r\n\r\nThere is a great demand for blankets and quilts in Dhupguri because of the cold atmosphere, and for this reason she hopes she will gain more profit from this business. She wishes with the profit of her business that she will be able to overcome these economic hurdles. Shipra is now trying to expand her business and thanks BJS as well as Kiva because without their help it would not be possible for her to go forward.

32-year-old Fatmata from Waterloo, the western rural part of Freetown in Sierra Leone. She is married with three children. For the past 10 years, Fatmata has had a retail business. She began her business because she wanted to create income to educate her children. She works at the business from 8:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m., six days per week. She says that the main challenge is that sometimes business is very slow.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase cigarettes, drinks and soap to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and increase her business. In the future, Fatmata plans to expand her business more than ever.

She studied up to grade 9. She is married to Mrinal, who is 34 years old and a car driver by profession. Mrinal studied up to grade 12. Their daughter is below school-going age. They live in the small village of Petkati in Maynaguri in the district of Jalpaiguri in their own \"kachha\" house (mud-, straw- and bamboo-made).\r\n\r\nAnna is a housewife. As the main source of income, her husband works as a car driver. His income is too low to cover all the family needs. So, both the husband and wife decided to start another business to give the family financial sustenance. They have decided to start a milk supply and milk products business.\r\n\r\nAnna heard that Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS) gives loans to rural women to start up new businesses. So, she has taken out a loan from BJS to purchase a cow and start a milk and milk products business (milk, butter, curd, paneer, etc.). Her main customers will be her neighbours and relatives.

Over time, Lorena enrolled in school. She has always been an excellent student and she earned good grades throughout her short life. When she was 16 years old, she started to realize that her vocation was to lend a hand and help others. Since she graduated, she recently decided to to study to become a nursing assistant at CampoAlto.\r\nShe has completed the first two semesters at one of the school's locations. During these semesters, she never failed a single subject. Since Lorena is paying for all of her studies, she was making a little more inexpensive monthly payments last semester. Since starting the internships, she has been informed that the agreement that she had making inexpensive payments has come to an end. She has to pay the normal fees that not just a little more expensive. This is a little discouraging because since she is the one paying for her education. \r\nAt this time, she wants to agree to a Kiva loan so that she can satisfactorily finish her nursing assistant course. She wants the family, including herself,  to have a better quality of life in the future. When she finishes her degree, she immediately wants to find employment. However, in the future, she has goals like starting studies to become a professional nurse. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1524605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay tuition for a semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-08T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-10T16:20:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":152961.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069808},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":152961.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882755},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-08T09:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":152961.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202119},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":152961.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286260},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":152961.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224967}],"funded_date":"2014-02-08T18:23:07Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Jackson","image":null}},{"id":666878,"name":"Noyaa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Noyaa group is composed of three members.

Sunaym has a high school education and earns the family's primary source of income by farming and raising livestock, which she started 29 years ago with the purchase of 1,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work she now owns three milk cows and a 1.56 acre plot of land where she grows vegetables and clover each year. She also has a greenhouse on her property where she plants tomatoes, early cucumbers and cabbage for family use and sale. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business Sunaym came to Bai Tushum for a loan to buy cows to expand her herd.

He lives in a house that he inherited from his parents some time ago.  Nestor finished his primary education with great dedication and sacrifice.  With a determined spirit, Nestor continued his studies a little bit at a time until he was able to finish a few years of his higher education.  Working and studying at the same time was very complicated, so unfortunately, he was not able to finish his degree.  Nestor secured a job in order to get by each day.

Considering that he is an older adult, Nestor has demonstrated that he is an example of continued determination.  <br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, Nestor experienced a serious accident that resulted in the amputation of his leg.  For this reason, he saw an opportunity to improve his future by requesting a loan.  He will buy a prosthetic and also make improvements to his home.

Originally from Venezuela, Nakaryd was soaring high in her business ventures in the cheese and fitness industry when one day, back in 2004, she was forced to leave her house and she lost everything she had. It was during this unrest in her hometown that she decided to come to the United States as a political refugee to start a new life.\r\n\r\nDespite having lost everything, Nakaryd knew that her entrepreneurial spirit was the greatest asset she had. Eager to live the American dream and wanting to set a good example for her family as an independent woman, she decided to reignite her passion in dance and turn it into a business.\r\n\r\nNakaryd is now a certified instructor of Zumba, a form of workout that combines Latin and international music with fun and effective exercises that is gaining popularity across the country. She wants to start a business offering Zumba lessons on a one-to-one basis in her backyard. \u201cI want to motivate people to feel happy about themselves and to help build their self-esteem, and dance is an excellent therapy for that!\u201d she says with a wide smile on her face. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to use this loan as start-up capital to buy sound equipment and to market her business so she can finally chase her vision of creating a cultural center, where each day she can contribute to make the magic transformation in all aspects of her clients\u2019 lives through dance. \r\n\r\nContribute to Nakaryd\u2019s loan and help her kick start her Zumba and fitness business to get her backyard thumping and rocking!

Thanks to Rakhimakhon's hard work,   her farm now includes three dairy cows she milks every day, selling milk to wholesalers and deriving a very good income from it. She also has a land plot of 1.3 ha [about 3 acres], where she  plants potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions ever year, for her own family needs as well as for sale. Her monthly income is 16,000 KGS. in order to develop her farm further, Rakhimkahon has applied to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan to buy vegetable seeds for the planting season as well as fertilizers. Rakhimkahon plans to use her resulting revenues for a further expansion of livestock. She plans to save money to build a new shed for her farm animals.

born a baby girl named Andrea. Her mother left her at two months of age with her grandparents. They took care of her while the aunts took care of her sister. At the age of 6 she started primary school, where she excelled academically. One of the aunts decided to take Andrea in and took care of her like a mother. Eventually, the family entered a period of great sadness due to the death of the grandfather, who was the person who had kept the family unified. \r\n\r\nFive years later, the aunt who took care of Andrea and her sister passed away. This was another difficult time for the family, but life continued and they learned to start again from this setback.\r\n\r\nShe has finished high school and is starting to study nursing with the support of her family and a program called Kiva. The first semester was wonderful because she learned many, many things in the company of her classmates. At the end of the semester her only uncle passed away, but she finished with good grades. And thanks to God, she met many people that are helping her grow as a person. \r\n\r\nSince the time she was young, she dreamed of being a good nurse because she loves to help people and it would be great to learn how to save lives. So, she decided to be part of Campo Alto because it is a good institution to learn to grow as a person.

She will buy merchandise and supplies in bulk (jeans, shirts, sneakers, school socks, cold cuts, beverages, sauces, etc.). This will help her to continue with both activities and improve the profits from her sales.\r\n\r\nGloria\u2019s dream is to open a store where she can offer her products and provide a better customer service. This will result in a more profitable business, which will help her to pay a better education for her son (both high school and university). He will then become an honest, prosperous and successful professional."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1525346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is 18 years old and will soon turn 19.  She lives in a small apartment with her mother, father, 10 year old younger sister, and her older brother.  She is in her third semester, where she does her practical work.  She has learned a lot at Campo Alto.  She has learned to take blood samples, to care for and orient people in relation to their needs and expectations from the institutions and current norms, to administer medicines as instructed and in agreement with established techniques and ethical and legal norms, to insert tubes, to generate healthy attitudes and practices at work, and to provide comprehensive care to individuals and families at all parts of the life cycle while understanding the social, political, cultural, and ethical context.  \r\n\r\nThis is an excellent career since this knowledge can help other people who need it.  She would like to continue studying since this is what she likes the most.  She finished high school a year and two months ago at the technical education high school and Celestin Freinet academy.  When she finished high school, she wanted to continue studying, and she has achieved that.  She wanted to study at the university, but it is very expensive, so she looked into other options. Campo Alto seemed like an excellent option since it was close to her home and she could travel by bicycle, and it was not as expensive as the university.  However, she was a little short of money since she started practicals this semester and her parents were not able to help pay for her studies.  They have to help her younger sister who is in fifth grade, the market, the bills, and all of the apartment costs are high, and this semester she has to buy uniforms and get the transportation and materials that the hospital requires.  Her parents only make the minimum amount of money.  \r\n\r\nShe is currently unemployed and could not work at any business because she has no experience and the schedule would not work because studying is her priority.  She wants to succeed in her career so that she can achieve the goals she has planned for the future.  After finishing this degree, she is thinking about doing another.  With the help of the degree she is completing now, she can pay for the other.  For this reason, she needs a loan from Kiva.  She would be grateful with all of her heart if you could help her.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1525368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of school.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-09T16:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-11T16:40:20Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leidy Tatiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":153786.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069815},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":153786.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882762},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-09T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":153786.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202126},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":153786.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286267},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":153786.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224974}],"funded_date":"2014-02-09T17:52:21Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":666472,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Delia vive en el municipio de Colomi de 27 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil soltera, econ\u00f3micamente es independiente, percibe ingresos economicos de la actividad de comercio, compra papa los d\u00edas jueves y domingo de los productores de Colomi y vende los d\u00edas mi\u00e9rcoles y s\u00e1bado en la feria de la ciudad de Cochabamba, tiene una experiencia de m\u00e1s de 6 a\u00f1os como comerciante.

Djiparkhan has a secondary education.  Djiparkhan's work in farming and animal husbandry, which began 10 years ago with 20,000 KGS, is the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Djiparkhan's hard work, she now has 1 milk cow, 4 sheep, and also 1.04 hectares of land, on which she raises potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions for consumption and for sale.  In addition to this, Djiparkhan bakes bread, which she sells in local grocery stores.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.

Her spouse helps her around the house.  Ozodakhon has a secondary education.  Ozodakhon's work in farming, which began 8 years ago with 25,000 KGS, is the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Ozodakhon's hard work, she now has a plot of land that is 0.65 hectares, on which she raises potatoes, turnips, tomatoes, and corn.  In the garden of her home are two greenhouses, in which she grows greens, radishes, and cucumbers year-round.  As of now she does not own cattle, but she has everything necessary to raise cattle, including a barn with a cattle shed, and sufficient hay.  Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS.  With the goal of furthering her business, Ozodakhon turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan to purchase steers to fatten and resell at the market for a higher price.  With the income from the loan Ozodakhon plans to improve her living conditions, and also to save toward building new, modern

Her husband helps around the house.  Barchinoy has a secondary education and worked as a primary school teacher for 20 years.  She has a great reputation among the inhabitants of her town because she helped educate many students.  Later she began working in retail, specifically selling women's clothing at the local market.  Barchinoy's work in farming, which began 30 years ago with 2,000 KGS, serves as an additional source of income for her family.  Thanks to Barchinoy's hard work, she now has a small plot of land measuring 0.43 hectares, on which she plants rice, corn, and cotton for consumption and for resale.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.  With the goal of furthering her business, Barchinoy turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan to purchase a cow for breeding.  With the income she will earn from the loan, Barchinoy plans to build a new greenhouse in her

She has looked after her 7 children alone since her husband's death in November 2013. Ibadat has struggled and survived great pain and the loss of her spouse. Her children are all married and live independently. As time has passed, Ibadat has gotten herself back on her feet, and continues to live and believe things will get better. She has a secondary school education.\r\n\r\nAs the primary means of supporting her family, Ibadat raises crops. She began farming 30 years ago, with 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today Ibadat has a 0.54 ha share of farmland, on which she grows potatoes for her own subsistence as well as for income.

She lives in a common-law relationship and has two children from this union, who are five and three years of age. The oldest attends school. Her husband is a craftsman and merchant.\r\n\r\nKaren and her husband have a workshop where they make all kinds of figures in clay or ceramics. They work every day, perfecting their pieces, because their best calling card is the quality of their work. Consequently, they have a very good clientele. They deliver their works unpainted to merchants in their area and in other cities, who come to their workshop to purchase their work. They have been producing these pieces for three years and have a very good customer base for such a short time in the business. This encourages them to keep moving forward.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to purchase ceramics and clay to make their pieces.

He and her husband are bringing up two children. Her husband works as a contract worker in construction. Elza has received secondary education. She works as a vendor selling seasonal products: every year in winter she buys and resells dairy products, and in the summer--frutis and vegetables. As a main source of income for her family Elza raises livestock and grows produces, having started five years ago by buying livestock for 15,000 KGS. Thanks to Elza's hard work, her farm now includes one dairy cow and one calf. She also has a land plot of 0.75 ha [about two acres], where she plants potatoes, corn and vegetables every year. Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, Elza has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan to buy a bull calf and increase her livestock headcount. Elza plans to use the resulting revenue for a further increase of livestock.

She is 40 years old and was born in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. She has been sewing traditional Tajik dresses for four years. Sewing and embroidering are trades passed from generation to generation, and her mother taught her how to sew and cut patterns. Rajabgul learned to sew a long time ago, but she only decided four years ago to turn her talent into a profitable occupation. She has now decided to expand her sewing business and wants to buy a new modernized sewing machine so that she can increase her speed and quality. She does not have enough money to buy one, so she applied for a loan.

He grew up in a simple family of farmers. Since early childhood he watched his relatives and neighbors as they worked with animals in the farm yard. In Kulob and other parts of Tajikistan agriculture is the main form of industry. Hasan has long wanted to begin a business in the animal husbandry sphere, since he knows how to care for animals, and has enough experience, feed, and a barn for them. Hasan needs financing in order to start the business, since he isn't in the position to implement his plans himself. Help Hasan buy animals and begin a new business and give his family new economic resources.

","en":"Djumakan is 61 years old, married, and has two children with her spouse. Djumakan has a high school education, and practices animal husbandry to earn the primary source of income for her family. She began 30 years ago with the purchase of 1,000 som (KGS) worth of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work, she now owns a dairy cow and two sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her business Djumakan came to Bai-Tushum for a loan to buy cows to expand her herd. She plans to invest income from the loan into further growing her number of livestock, and she plans to save money to buy apartments for her grandchildren.
