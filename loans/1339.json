She is married to Tomas, a farmer, and they have children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSofia operates a piggery. She earns by selling live hogs to meat dealers. Sometimes they have the pigs slaughtered and sold in the market.  Aside from this, she also cooks breakfast meals for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1,200 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy feed and additional hogs.\r\n\r\nSofia dreams of expanding her business, and hopes that all her children will finish their studies.

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Her family consists of one daughter and three sons. Her husband is responsible to fulfill the needs of the entire family. Jameela has been running a tailoring center for the past seven years and contributes her income with her husband's to manage the household.\r\n\r\nJameela wants to purchase different kinds of goods, e.g needles, machine oil, pieces of clothes in bulk, benches and sewing tables, etc. for her business purpose. But due to insufficient financial means she is unable to purchase these goods. Therefore, she applied for a Kiva loan from BRAC Pakistan so that she can purchase these goods to provide better tailoring facilities and earn a maximum profit. This loan will also help her to increase daily sales.\r\n\r\nJameela is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

The store is her additional means of earning a living in support of her family needs. \r\n\r\nFortunately, her area is located in a populous neighborhood, and so she makes promising daily sales. Maria Fe will keep running the store well even though there is increased competition from other stores.

Many residents of this area make use of its balmy weather for agriculture.  Qurbonali is no different, and is seeking to start up his own livestock-farming business.  He's preparing to raise cattle and already has a cow pen, some experience raising livestock and some initial money to get things up and running.  However, he doesn't have enough money to buy enough cattle to start his business.  As such, he's turned to you for help and is seeking a loan to buy cattle.

","en":"This is Anyela Daniela.  She wants to tell you when she started to feel motivated to start this career. \r\n\r\nIt all started when she was six or seven years old, more or less, when she finished kindergarten.  He mother always cultivated her creativity.  Through this ability, she developed a marvelous passion for drawing.  She has had that passion for a long time, and she it continues to be one of her passions.  As the years passed, she lived very happily with a united family in a healthy atmosphere.  \r\n\r\nHer parents married when they were very young, and then they did not wait to have children.  They had five children, and she is, at 18 years of age, the middle child.  Her father always gave them the best, and she did not lack for anything.  She lived in a world of luxuries.  However, she did not have what is the most important, an understanding father.  In time, the breach between them got bigger, to the point of dividing the family.  Now, only the mother and the siblings were getting ahead.  The father disappeared for one year.  As much as she could, she started to rise from the depths.  She grew and started to reflect upon her father\u2019s absence.  The sisters started to have all types of problems.  They had to change cities, but her mother\u2019s health deteriorated.  That is why they returned to Bogota.\r\n\r\nHer brother started to have serious problems.  Because of this, she decided to study comprehensive early childhood care.  As she came to the end of the second semester, she got sick.  She was in bed for two months, and her health was deteriorating.  After a long period of one year, her parents decided to collaborate in order to be able to pay for the semester.  However, before she started, she was working in a kindergarten for three months, which left her exhausted.   After a time, her mother left with her sister for another city in order to have surgery for her health.\r\n\r\nShe now lives with her father\u2019s sister, who is not able to help her pay for the semester.  That is why she is requesting help from Kiva so that she is finally able to fulfill the dream that she left halfway through due to health problems.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to work with a vulnerable population in order to be able to provide, through experience and education, a new model.  She wants to do this so that they see and desire a change, like she is doing through her studies.  She wants to show them a different reality that is far from what they are living.  She wants to fill the emotional voids, to treat conflicts at their root, and to give them an effective and lasting solution.\r\n\r\nShe knows that it is not changing the world, but it is contributing to the physical, emotional, and spiritual growth of those who most need it.  This can be a reality for those that need it.\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1525976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay to register for a semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-10T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-12T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anyela Daniela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069820},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882767},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-09T09:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202131},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286272},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224979}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T18:14:43Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":667461,"name":"Jupie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a way of generating income, Jupie engages in cooking and selling meals and snacks within her community.

Guljanat has a secondary education. Her husband works as a distributor of irrigation water.  To provide the primary income for her family, Guljanat is involved in farming and animal husbandry, having started 13 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 6 sheep and 1 dairy cow that she milks daily and sells milk to milk distributors, and has a very good income.  She also has a 2.0 hectare land plot, where she annually grows onions, pumpkins and beans for sale, and a .10 hectare land plot in her garden, where she grows strawberries that yield about 8,000 som (KGS) during the season.

She has applied for a loan of 2,500,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more bags of sugar, cartons of salt, boxes of soap, jerrycans of cooking oil, bags of rice, loaves of bread and trays of eggs.  \r\n\r\nShe works in a shop and sells on wholesale basis seven days out of every week. Her major business challenges include transportation of commodities and ever increasing prices of commodities in Uganda.

The same is true for her family. \r\nIt all started when her father died and her mother was left alone in life with Erika and her three siblings and no possibility of any type of help.  Her mother had to struggle with all of them by working in private homes in thousands of informal positions. \r\nErika, being the oldest, took care of her siblings.  She was in 7th grade.  It was very difficult for her to go to school and later return home to feed and otherwise take care of her siblings.  \r\nOnce Erika was in 10th grade, her mother made the decision to take her out of school, as they didn't have money for food much less for school supplies. \r\nJust like her mother, Erika started working in informal jobs and hard labors to help her family. \r\nAfter a while, Erika's mother started a relationship with someone with whom she ended up having a lot of problems.  As such, living together turned hellish, and so she left. \r\nFortunately, Erika was 18-years old by then and could work in any job.  She was paying rent by herself.  Motivated by her desire to improve her situation, she finished high school and graduated. \r\nShe was awarded a scholarship by the Adoratrices sisters.  She took advantage of the scholarship to finish her schooling.  She is now a sewing technician.  She purchased a sewing machine and a surger and is able to work with them.  But since working independently is very difficult, she needs a decent amount of capital, which she doesn't have right now.  \r\nSeven years ago, Erika had tried to go to school at Campo Alto to study nursing.  But she didn't have enough money to pay for her room and board, so she withdrew.  Later, she tried again with health administration, but ended up in the same situation. \r\nErika has always liked health sciences, and she has tried with a lot of effort to study it; it's what she likes and what she wants to do with her life.  Right now, she works as an employee for a sewing company. \r\nIn 2013 she started studying pharmaceutical services.  She just loves it and with much sacrifice, is already in her second semester.  She is very motivated and really hopes to finish her studies and specialize in alternative medicine. \r\nErika's dreams are to keep studying so she can have good job opportunities and to travel to other countries to fill herself with knowledge and later share it with her community.  Most of all, she wants to keep helping her mother and her youngest brother, who is going to be dependent on his family his whole life due to a disability.  Erika only hopes that her life story is useful to benefit KIVA."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1525996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester's tuition.

She sells her products to the traders from the nearest town who come to take vegetables from her farm. \r\n\r\nParbati says that she earns a minimum amount of 5,000 INR per month from this business. This is insufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of her family as well as the farm expenses. Parbati wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. She will utilize the present loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides for her farm. She expects a good return from her business by expanding her cultivation. \r\n\r\nParbati dreams to construct a house and purchase a water pump for a better irrigation facility for her farm. She also hopes to give her whole family a bright future through her hard work. \r\n\r\nThe other fourteen members of this group are also involved in businesses like vegetable cultivation, general grocery shop, vegetable vending, and tailoring businesses.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1527009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides for expanding her farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUREKELA, BANGOMUNDA, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-02-10T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-12T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Parbati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manju ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rashmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagyabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lambai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parbati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhukei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mahalati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Radha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jashomani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-02-21T11:33:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":667523,"name":"Lassan\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Nouveau partenaire de Nafa Naana pour la distribution de produits \u00e9nergie (foyers am\u00e9lior\u00e9s, foyers \u00e0 gaz et lampes solaires diverses), Lassan\u00e9 a un besoin financier de 265 150 FCFA pour commencer l\u2019activit\u00e9.

She has been a seamstress for the past ten years and has provided her services to a company that makes shirts. \r\n\r\nNow Marlene wants to set up her own shop and has approached Fundacion Alternativa because she doesn't have the money to buy sewing machines. She has a small amount of money saved up because this has been her dream for a long time, and bit by bit she has been able to scrape together this money. But it is not enough to buy the necessary machines for the shop. A loan has helped Marlene start up her new business. She is very happy and feels very grateful to Fundacion Alternativa and Kiva because many other institutions didn't believe in her dream and closed their doors to her.

It is composed of four women who know one another through ties of kinship and community. The women average 32 years of age. Married and having five children on average, they run different businesses, such as commerce in condiments, just like DJENEBA, who is the second persons standing from the right in the photo. The women live in large traditional families in Ouelessebougou, in Pr\u00e9fecture de KATI (R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro) in the Republic of Mali. They have been in small-scale commerce for several years and are much in demand for their work. \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying the growing needs of their customers, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago. They are in their fifth solidarity loan. DJENEBA, the group's president, is well-known in OUELESSBOUGOU. She excels in selling condiments. She intends to use her loan to purchase different types (black pepper, tomatoes, onions, cabbages, and dried okra). She gets her supplies in BAMAKO from wholesalers, and she makes her sales retail to a customer base composed of men and women paying in cash or on credit, in OUELESSEBOUGOU. She is hoping for a monthly profit of 45,000 francs CFA that will enable her to pay back the loan and reinvest in her business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1526994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-02-10T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-12T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenimba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-19T09:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":81841.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459220779},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-23T09:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":81841.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045697},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":81841.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263538},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":81841.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960411},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":81841.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504676829}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T22:34:17Z","paid_date":"2014-07-18T09:29:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":667565,"name":"Saeedi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saeedi has successfully built her general store with the help of Kashf Foundation and Kiva.

She is married and lives with her husband in her own home in the Tierra Blanca neighborhood.  They have lived there for 60 years.  The neighborhood is a part of Atuntaqui, an area where the majority of the people make their livings in fabrications.  They have workshops where they make clothing of different designs that are offered for sale in the province and other areas. \r\nLuz sells root vegetables.  She has been in this line of work for years.  From her stall in the Amazonas market she sells root vegetables such as: tubers, tomatoes, potatoes, ocas and other products.  Each day she purchases the items that she will sell. She makes her purchases in the province and offers them for sale to a variety of customers.  Luz is skilled in selling her merchandise.  She washes the items until they are very clean, and that is how she ends up with such striking products for the market.  Luz learned the business on her own initiative when she was 14-years old.  Her parents brought her to the markets to make small sales, and that is how she is still selling root vegetables today.  Luz sells her vegetables from 6:00am until 6:00pm at the market.  The loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa she will invest in continuing to purchase more merchandise and grains and to continue selling to more people and expanding her sales stall.

She is 20 years old and graduated from Juan Iozano y Iozano in 2011. Her dream is to study Accounting. She began inquiring at several universities and institutions but some were very expensive, others didn`t have a flexible schedule, and the rest didn't have monthly payment options. She decided to postpone her dream of studying for 6 months, which she wanted most, to work as a bank teller. Later she left to be able to study but she didn\u2019t have the sufficient money to pay for university. Mayra continued working in a call centre in the area of banking. She realized that if she wanted to be someone important she had to study. Mayra knew a friend who studied in INSTITUCI\u00d3N DE EDUCACI\u00d3N SUPERIOR LAS MERCEDES (Institution of Higher Education Las Mercedes) and gave her high recommendations of this institution. Mayra went and inquired about payment options, agreements, and the schedules and most importantly that it wasn\u2019t very costly and that they didn\u2019t charge very high interest rates. Mayra enrolled to study in August 2013, first semester of professional technical of Financial Accounting in which she felt very comfortable and learned many things as the professors were very good and explained very well. Now she is in second semester. She is very grateful to the INSTITUCI\u00d3N DE EDUCACI\u00d3N SUPERIOR LAS MERCEDES as they have given her much knowledge and have opened many doors for job opportunities. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Mayra needs a loan from Kiva as she hasn't been working for a month. She lives alone and has other important expenses. She doesn't want to leave her studies as she wants to turn her dream into reality and she doesn't want to stop studying at the INSTITUCI\u00d3N DE EDUCACI\u00d3N SUPERIOR LAS MERCEDES as it is a good opportunity to study there because of the easy payment option and the schedule.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1525998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a school semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-10T21:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-12T21:40:10Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069822},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882769},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-09T09:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202133},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286274},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":133333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224981}],"funded_date":"2014-02-10T21:48:37Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diana Lima","image":830085}},{"id":667573,"name":"Khursheed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khursheed is a 43-year-old married woman and the mother of four children.

Some days they work very late in order to finish a job. They don't have a fixed schedule but their usual work day is ten hours.

They also perform folk dances for the winners of the sporting events.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 lives in this town and has a business. Jos\u00e9 is a struggling 23 year-old youth. He is married and has two daughters. The eldest is 5 years old, the youngest is 3 years old. He, together with his wife, are in dairy production for a living as their only source of income to meet the expenses and needs of their family. They learned this trade from a young age together with their parents. They were raised on purely cattle raising farms doing this activity on average 8 hours a day. Jos\u00e9 had many difficulties in his life due to lack of resources that kept him from going to school. He only has his primary education and struggles today so that his daughters have what he did not. He will invest this loan in the purchase of more dairy cows to increase his income.\r\nJos\u00e9 is grateful to the Alternative Foundation and Kiva for the great support and the opportunity provided to himself and his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1526009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP12, 000 loan.

Her daughter and elder son are both married, and the younger children are in school. Makhira has a higher education. She works as a teacher of Kyrgyz language and literature in a local school, and has 20 years of pedagogical experience. As an additional source of income for her family, Makhira raises livestock and crops, having begun 26 years ago with a livestock purchase on 5,000 som KGS. <br \/><br \/>Thanks to her hard work, Makhira currently has on her homestead: one dairy cow, one calf, and one sheep. They have all the conditions for tending livestock. The feed and hay are prepared. Makhira also has a plot of land measuring 2.80 hectares, on which annually she grows beans and clover for on-farm use and sale. Monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS). With the aim of further developing her homestead, Makhira applied to the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan - to purchase cows for expanding her livestock count, and also for increasing monthly income from the sale of dairy products. <br \/><br \/>Makhira plans to invest income from the loan in further propagation of the quantity of domestic animals, and plans to save money to buy

Kanchaiym and her husband are proud of their children, since they gave them a sufficient education, all their daughters are married, and their youngest son and his wife live with them. <br \/><br \/>Kanchaiym has a specialized secondary education, having graduated from medical school with a nursing specialization. Her work activity began in 1973 and she worked in a local hospital as a nurse. Now, along with her husband she is retired. Kanchaiym goes through life optimistically, knows concretely what she wants and achieves it all with her own strengths. Kanchaiym knows how to correctly use and budget monetary resources to achieve her goals. Kanchaiym is sitting on a pension and, as a main source of income for her family, raises livestock and crops, having begun four years ago with a livestock purchase of 30,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Kanchaiym currently has on her homestead: one dairy cow, five sheep and two horses. They have all the conditions for caring for livestock: a barn for keeping the livestock, remote pastures. The dairy cows are kept year-round at home, and care for themselves, but the sheep from March to October every year are sent off to remote pastures. The hay and feed for the livestock are prepared in sufficient quantities.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My artistic formation came from my dad during his work as an archeologist in pre-Hispanic sites, and later as the curator of a museum. That's when I became inspired to craft jewelry with designs and motifs unique to ancient Peru. One of my most cherished moment was when I had a small workshop and my children, Carlos and Alicia, where with me while I was cutting gems by hand. Then we put them through a little machine to perfect the contours. I love the idea that foreigners can get to share part of our history through my designs, where I try to replicate both metals and gems.\"\r\n\r\n\"With this loan, I'd like to renew my jewelry collection, and we hope to have a great response to our 2014 designs.

My goals are to master foreign languages, be able to communicate with the foreign people, travel and to get a well-paying future job. When you know foreign languages well, you can read their literature in origin, learn that people\u2019s culture, traditions, will be able to be in their country and observe their life with your own eyes. At school I learned English as a foreign language, which helped me to be enrolled at AUCA. Now I take French and German and wish to visit European countries and get MBA in one of them. One of the people who promotes my idea is my brother. He himself studies at AUCA and contended with its education and international atmosphere. He has a chance to choose the classes to take, meet students from different countries, and take part in extracurricular activities at the University. From my point of view, AUCA is doing everything for the convenience of students, the other advantages are computers with Internet access, a laboratory which is fully equipped with multimedia equipment, library, electronic catalog and electronic database, availability of Cambridge and Oxford Journals, Oxford reference books and etc. Degrees awarded by AUCA are valid throughout the world. The university attracts only the best professors from all over the world who really love to work with students. I feel I am a part of AUCA and want to be in the future. As I said my brother also studies here, so it\u2019s too hard for my parents to pay for both of us. I am in a need of KIVA loan and hope to get it.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1527510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

","en":"Asel is 28 years old and married. She and her husband are bringing up two children. Asel has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Asel raises livestock and grows produce, having launched this business 10 years ago by buying livestock for 5,000 KGS. Thanks to Asel's hard work, her farm now includes two dairy cows and one horse. She also has a small land plot, 0.53 ha [1.3 acres] in size, where she mainly grows wheat, barley and potatoes. Her monthly income is 11,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, Asel has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan to increase her livestock headcount by buying bull calves. Asel plans to use her resulting revenues for an additional increase of livestock. She also plans to save up to buy a car for her family.

She did not previously have other loans from state banks, but FUDECOSUR has offered her a loan with greater ease and a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1527148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"Asistencia de caf\u00e9","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Santa Teresa de Caj\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2014-02-12T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-14T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2017-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":43.7,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-20T08:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":43.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479137029},{"amount":324.91,"local_amount":166622.97,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":167382.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611783584}],"funded_date":"2014-02-17T20:11:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie N.","image":1077468}},{"id":666051,"name":"Batmagul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0411\u0430\u0442\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0443\u043b 48 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0443\u0436-\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c. \u0414\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438. \u0423 \u0411\u0430\u0442\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0443\u043b -

She is married to Rodolfo, an employee and a father to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nJosephine operates a tailoring business. She mainly offers curtains, bed sheets, blankets and other home trappings. Seasonal demand for clothing like uniforms and such is available all year round. She also does repairs and alterations. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day. To help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other items needed in her business.\r\n \r\nJosephine hopes to have additional business, and dreams of giving her children a good life and education.

","en":"Dinara is 38 years old and married.  She and her husband are raising four children.  She has a higher education and makes a living teaching elementary grades at a local school.  Her husband works as an electrician and brings home a stable salary.  In order to make an additional income for her family, Dinara is also involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  She started in this field 15 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, her farming business now consists of two dairy cows, one horse, 30 sheep, 15 goats, one heifer and 25 chickens.  Dinara's children are very actively involved with the farm work, and all members of the family are assigned responsibilities for the care of the animals.

Jyldyz has secondary education, she is a housewife and does animal husbandry as a main source of income for her family. She started this business twenty years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Jyldyz now has one milk cow, one calf, fifteen sheep and also cultivates 1,11 hectares of arable land where she annually plants potatoes and beans for resale.

Therefore, she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will help her to purchase these clothes for reselling purposes and enable her to earn a favorable income.

All of her children are married and live on their own with their families, except for her youngest son, who still lives with his parents and helps around the house. Jumakan has a high school education and spent 27 years working on a collective farm after finishing school. She is currently retired, but doesn't sit around doing nothing - she works in agriculture and animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 22 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has one milking cow, three horses and 20 sheep as well as 0.96 hectares of land on which she mainly grows beans and hay, with a monthly income of 10,500 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Jumakan has turned to bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase sheep to increase her head count of livestock. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further augmentation of the size of her herd, and to save toward buying property for her middle son to build a house on.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1524776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kok-Kashat village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-12T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-14T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":76.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":577.04,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":30216.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.96,"payment_id":579488857},{"amount":456.54,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25180.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":43.46,"payment_id":610751138},{"amount":90.21,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5036.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.79,"payment_id":696499993}],"funded_date":"2014-02-26T12:25:53Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:49:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":668185,"name":"Kennedy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kennedy is a 31-year-old married man with 2 children who are 3 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nHe describes himself as ambitious.
