She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tepa joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD.

He lives in a house that is his own together with his 17-year old son, Yasmani. He is always ready to work very hard to make a living. Coffee and banana is the activity to which Lucio is dedicated. Every day from the very early morning he sets out to work on his land. His only goal is to put in a great deal of effort so that his plantations will be high in quality. What he most enjoys about his work is cultivating the land. He has 25 years in the business. The most difficult part of his work is having to fumigate because the chemicals can be harmful to his health. In time, he hopes to plant more in order to increase production.

He has been engaged in this business for years. He produces window and door frames based on the customers\u2019 order. The income generated from the business is unstable and often insufficient to fully cover their living as well as the educational fees of his children.  \r\n\r\nIn order to earn more income, Messak is thinking of initiating other businesses. He plans to rent a plot of land for five years and purchase four sacks of corn seed and fertilizer. He would like to cultivate corn at the farm and to sell it after the harvest. Therefore, he is requesting a loan of IDR 7,500,000 from TLM. He hopes that TLM will approve his loan application

The first was to eliminate the breeding grounds for mosquitoes infected with Dengue, a sometimes fatal disease. At the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguay Office in Caacupe the women cleaned the patio, sidewalks, and streets around the neighborhood.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe second activity is to combat the other sickness that affects not only their neighborhood, but also the rest of the country; crime.  Their efforts along with other organizations, demonstrate that there are united, organized people who are prepared to help one another. Ger\u00f3mina commented that the only way to combat these two evils is to be united and work in groups. <p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan Ger\u00f3mina and the other women will continue to expand their businesses.  They are working to become a united force in the community who will influence others in their community to have pride for their neighborhood and their country. <p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":118934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy the premium materials for the production of Chipas, a favorite Paraguayan bread snack made from starch, cheese, vegetable oil, and flour.

province, one of Mongolia's western provinces. His three children are ages 5 to 12. Tsagaanbandi and his wife both have small businesses in their respective fields. His wife sells various vegetables at the local food market and Tsagaanbandi does transporting with his truck and small car. He has worked as a truck driver for the last twenty years. After the collapse of the command economy in late 1990, he purchased the truck he used to drive for a company and since then he has been doing business with his own truck. In the winter, he uses his truck to carry coal from countryside to the town for retail. With his profit, he was able to buy a small old car that he now uses as a cab for additional income.\r\n<p>\r\nHe requests a loan to purchase more coal and more vegetables for his family businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans. This not only allows borrowers to gain financially, but also encourages them to save.\r\n\r\nTo get regular updates from XacBank, please join our lending team:

Some of the eggs her chickens will produce will be for their own consumption, some will be sold, and some will be hatched to be raised again. If Edlyn feels happy and successful running a business, she would prefer not to go abroad and would look after her daughter

Esta bebida es muy consumida por la zona, ya que los trabajadores agr\u00edcolas de la zona piensan que esta bebida les da fuerzas para continuar con sus actividades.\n\nLa chicha de jora se prepara con un tipo especal de ma\u00edz denominado jora, este ma\u00edz se muele y se hierve en grandes ollas hasta que est\u00e9 completamente cocido, luego se le agrega az\u00facar y se deja fermentar en vasijas de barro.

She makes the chicha in her home and offers it to her neighbors and acquaintances.  This drink is commonly consumed in this area, since the agricultural workers here think that the drink gives them strength to continue with their activities.  \r\n\r\nThe chicha de jora is made with a special type of corn called \"jora\" that is ground, and boiled in large pots until it is completely cooked.  Later sugar is added and it is left to ferment in terra cotta containers.  This is a tradition that dates back to remote times and is continued by the people who live in the northern part of the Lambayeque region.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Blanca raises and sells animals; she raises sheep in the back of her home and sells them to the traders who visit the area every so often.\r\n\r\nBlanca is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1,000 Peruvian soles which will help her to expand her chicha business.  She plans to buy more supplies (sugar, corn and firewood) with the money from the loan.  \r\n\r\nShe is a cheerful woman who is always looking for ways to keep active and help support her family.  Her main desire is to continue to advance her family economically and to provide her children with the opportunity to continue their studies at the college level.

Tangub City. Helen is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group members receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Helen A.\u2019s Group.\r\n\t\r\nHelen was blessed with two children who are now school age. For her living, she decided to engage in operating a sari-sari store and a banana buy and sell business. For four years, she has been able to maintain the businesses during ups and downs. Now she earns an average net income of not less than P 3,500 a month, which is very helpful to her family.  She joined the cooperative in 2009. As an active center chief and member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting an amount of P5,000 as her second loan t to add capital to her existing sari-sari store and banana buy and sell business. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of her family, to meet their basic needs and save for future use. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or approximately USD 117 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruta joined SPBD and this is her 2nd loan with them.

He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She lives in her own house, and is disposed to work very hard to succeed in life.  Elizabeth\u2019s store is one of the most frequented in Yanango.  She opens very early in the morning, as she expects her neighbors to visit to buy the items they need.  She is a good salesperson, happy and attentive, and always greets her customers with a smile and ready to assist them with their purchases.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is chatting with her neighbors.  She has been in business for 3 years, and finds the most difficult aspect of her work to be staying all day in her storefront without leaving.

She lives with her daughter and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her two children are both university students. They own a plot of land and a family house. Altantsetseg used to work for a state-owned leather processing factory until 1991 when it was privatized and she lost her job due to job cuts. Then, together with her two girlfriends, she established a partnership, rented a work space and started producing leather garments. She still works there as a tailor.

She is a happy and hard-working person who makes her living growing coffee.  She is married and has three children, two of whom are boys.  Together with her family, she lives in the Las Vegas community in the municipality of Trojes.  Mayra began growing coffee in 1993; she learned the skill from her parents.  The workday on the farm starts at 6:00am and finishes at 12:00pm.  She has the help of her husband and some workers.  Mayra also runs a small grocery from her home.  Her children trade off helping her with the customers.  Mayra decided to get into the grocery business because her earnings from coffee growing weren't enough to cover the household expenses and her children's schooling.  Mayra does not currently have any major difficulties supporting her family.  She feels very grateful to god and thankful for the financial help she has been granted through FAMA.  Mayra needs the requested loan to purchase fertilizers to be able to fertilize the roughly 12 acres of land she has planted with coffee.  With the help of the loan, she will have better quality production and will be able to sell at a better price.  Mayra's goal is to keep her businesses active and to continue getting into other businesses.  She also wants to continue to humbly give her family a better quality of life.  This is Mayra's third cycle with FAMA and she plans to punctually comply with her re-payment schedule."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":851301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer for her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Trojes, El Paraiso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-25T00:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Mirtala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":22095.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165428}],"funded_date":"2011-08-25T02:47:52Z","paid_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":332879,"name":"Ana Matilde","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Matilde de cuarenta y seis a\u00f1os de edad vive con su compa\u00f1ero de vida en casa propia.

She began her business because she  was brought up by her elder sister who did not think it was worthy for her to go school; instead, her sister let her assist in her business and since then she became a trader and business is a part of her. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 2,215,000 Sierra Leone leones (SLL) every month from this business.\n\nYa Kaday would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL.  She requires a loan in order to purchase Rubber Slippers (men), 1 dozen @ 1,000,000 SLL; Sandals 1 dozen @ 1,000,000 SLL; and Rubber Slippers (women) 1 dozen @ 1,000,000 SLL. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 333,000.\n\nIn the future, Ya Kaday plans to improve her business and her living condition.  It will help her as she is also planning to build a house. She wants to see her children through school.\n\nThe rainy season is her problem as the stall she is trading on is not well protected. Competition is high but she buys more goods and quality stock. She serves people in villages and the city town, about 15 people per day. She goes in for the latest designs and sells them at affordable prices.  She buys her goods in Freetown twice per month. Ya Kaday uses her profit by buying more goods to add to her existing ones.

Her biggest dream is to establish another business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

","en":"Nuve Victoria lives on the streets General Torres and Gaspar Sangurima in the center of the city of Cuenca.  She is 38 years old, and has four children, aged 18, 17, 14, and 10 years old.  All of her children are studying in the high school Manuel J. Calle, and the youngest is in the school Ezequiel Crespo.  She has been separated for several years because her husband migrated, leaving her with their young children, living in a rented house.\r\n<p> \r\nShe has many jobs which have allowed her to get ahead.  She works in the EMAC (Empresa Municipal de Aseo de Cuenca) (Municipal Waste Services of Cuenca) from Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm.  On the weekends, she works as a shopkeeper selling a wide variety of clothing.  She also sells women's beauty products, such as Yanbal products.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has had her business 6 years or so, and says that the advantage of working like that is that from her sales she is able to pay her rent and some more expenses of the home.

She works baking cakes and selling Renaware products. She bakes the cakes at home and delivers them to various shops. She makes six cakes a week and earns 4 soles for each cake. She bakes on alternate days (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays). Her goal is to one day have a bakery and make different kinds of pastries, and that her son would become a professional. She says she enjoys her business very much because she still has time to spend with her son. \r\n\r\nShe also sells Renaware products on credit, accepting regular payments for them. She mentions that since she joined up with Finca Peru her life has changed since she has learned the importance of saving. \r\n\r\nShe will invest the money in the purchase of cake pans, a stove\/cooker, flour, butter, eggs and sugar. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Margaret Wolfe-Roberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":558892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cake pans, a stove\/cooker, flour, butter, eggs and sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-06-23T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elbia Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":291.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":294.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159630029},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":294.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844075},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":294.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110253},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-20T10:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":294.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177403483},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":294.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542035},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":294.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188678846}],"funded_date":"2010-06-23T06:23:21Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:04:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":214049,"name":"Ngurn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ngurn Ngurng is 51 years old and is a villager who lives in Romiet village, Takeo province.

He sees to the education of his three children.  The oldest is 9 years old and goes to school in the morning and helps out in the afternoons feeding the pigs.

Matilde works growing avocados. She has a farm that has approximately  200 trees, and she has worked it for 10 years. She says that she began this project because her husband started to buy the plants by threes every two weeks, and she cultivated them. Thus, little by little they established their farm. During harvest time, she goes out to sell her avocados by the bucketful at the central warehouse of Zitacuaro, and sometimes they rent trees that already have fruit to customers. She is requesting a loan from the financial institution to buy fertilizers and hoses for irrigation, since the water source is a little bit far away, and this will help her reach all the trees to water them, so they don't dry out during this hot season. She will go to buy the hose because she will soon have some small fruit on the trees, and she is taking good care of them so that they don't dry out. Matilde's goal with her farm is to keep planting more avocado trees since they are giving her good earnings.

She lives in the Sector Alto Moche del District Moche, Province of Trujillo, Department of La Libertad.  She has 3 children who still depend on her for support.  Felicita Maria has a beauty salon where she offers services of haircuts, makeup application, hair coloring, skin and hand care.  Before starting her business Felicita worked in an office but there was reduction of staff and she was one of the people dismissed.  When she was let go, she didn't know what to do, but then decided to take up a course in cosmetology.  She was also sewing and designing clothes during the evenings for some customers.  Later, with a friend's suggestion, she decided to join the group \"Los Jazmines\" and her first loan was for S \/. 300.00 soles.  This money helped her purchase products for her salon, like: a dozen dyes, perm solution, creams, treatments for the scalp and hair, etc. She plans on repaying this loan in 4 months.

Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.<p> I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals?

Ayu Ketut Ranten mengandalkan hasil dari mengolah ladang bersama suaminya. Itupun hasilnya tidak seberapa besar dibandingkan dengan kebutuhan yang harus ditanggung setiap hari di keluarganya. Termasuk juga menanggung kedua anaknya yang masih sekolah di SMA dan SD. Dengan modal awal Rp.1000.000,- Gusti Ayu membuka warung di rumahnya yang menjual beberapa kebutuhan pokok serta makanan dan minuman. Gusti Ayu berharap bisa mendapatkan penghasilan tambahan dari usaha yang sudah ditekuninya hampir 2 tahun itu. Tetapi karena keterbatasan modal membuat usaha warungnya tidak berkembang dengan baik. Setelah mendapatkan penjelasan dari Staf DINARI tentang program yang mengembangkan usaha untuk masyarakat kecil, akhirnya Gusti Ayu memutuskan untuk meminjam modal ke DINARI melalui program Tempek. Pinjaman ini merupakan yang pertama bagi Gusti Ayu dan jangka waktunya adalah selama 12 bulan. Pembayaran dilakukan dengan cara mencicil setiap bulannya. Dengan modal yang dipunyai sekarang Gusti Ayu mampu menambah omset barang dagangannya menjadi lebih lengkap. Para pelanggannya yang berasal dari sekitar rumah Gusti Ayu pun semakin ramai karena barang-barang kebutuhan yang dijual sudah tersedia lengkap dan tidak perlu harus mencari jauh ke tempat lainnya. Hasil yang didapat dari usaha warungnya ini lumayan besar, setelah dipotong pembayaran ke DINARI setiap bulannya Gusti Ayu bisa meraup keuntungan mencapai Rp.200.000,-. Tentunya hasil ini sangat membantu perekonomian keluarga Gusti Ayu serta mampu memenuhi biaya sekolah kedua anaknya.","en":"As villagers who live in a village on a downhill, Gusti Ayu Ketut Ranten and her husband count on their garden products to fulfill their daily need but the income earned from gardening has never been enough, including to fund their 2 children in studying in elementary and high school level.\r\n\r\nWith Rp 1,000,000 as initial capital, Gusti Ayu started to open a small grocery store in their house. Gusti Ayu hopes that she will be able to earn additional income from her business that has been running for about 2 years.

After attending a short presentation on small enterprise development from DINARI, Gusti Ayu decided to propose loan from them through Tempek Program. The loan will be the first for her, that will be paid 12 months with monthly installment. With this additional capital, Gusti Ayu will be able to add the number and the varieties of goods she sell that she is sure her customer will be increase because they do not have to look for goods that they need to other store.\r\n\r\nThe income from her grocery store is quite good.

B. is 36 years old, is single and has a 10 year old daughter who is the reason for her effort and sacrifice.  Alejandrina is part of the \u201cRENOVACI\u00d3N\u201d group, formed by 11 other members dedicated to working in order to support their families.  For 7 years Alejandrina has made her living selling sweets, for which she uses a little car located outside a call center on North Panamerican Ave.  Before she became pregnant, she worked as a maid in a house.  However, when the owners found out about her condition, they couldn't keep her in the job.  And so with very little money, she invested in the purchase of sweets and sold them while walking up and down various streets.  Currently she helps in a restaurant that is located in the market, which generates another income for her.  With her work she has been able to give her daughter an education; she studies in a private school.  She would like, in the future, to rent a stand to start a restaurant, which is the work that she likes best.  The requested loan will be invested in the purchase of sweets.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":433368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Invest in the purchase of sweets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":129,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nathaly Katiuska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anyanet Nimia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayala Obregon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2080},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2080},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2080},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2080},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2080}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2080,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2088,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669109},{"amount":725,"local_amount":2080,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2088,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064571},{"amount":725,"local_amount":2080,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2088,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899631},{"amount":725,"local_amount":2080,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2088,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933714},{"amount":725,"local_amount":2080,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2088,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661323}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T08:32:38Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":160177,"name":"Kampala One Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulo K. is 45, married, and has six children between the ages of 3 and 19.

The children attend the local school. Maritza is a very hardworking woman. She began to make tamales to sell when she saw the many things lacking in her home, but especially for her children's education.  Tamales are made from corn and filled with chicken and vegetables. This food is sold for weekend dinners and it is a very profitable business. Maritza is asking for a loan with which she can buy a greater quantity of corn, vegetables and chicken so she can make a greater quantity of product. This will allow her to earn more, which greatly incentivizes Maritza to continue with her business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":507690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase corn, chicken and vegetables.

She owns a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Sesilia has 1 year of experience in this business.  Sesilia needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 talas or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Sesilia joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sesilia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

After he fully matured, he left farming in the village for the city. In the city, he helped to sell for somebody on commission where he accumulated some funds, which he used to start his own business.

He felt good about taking this loan and the loan will help him to improve his business and his family's standard of living.  His major challenge is that sometimes the bales he buys contain spoiled\/damaged clothing. He serves 15 customers each day. His business is popular because he sells quality used clothing. Lamin does not have any employees. His suppliers are located in Conakry and he transports his good by public transport. He buys three times in a month.  He plows back the profit into the business.

Joined together by family and neighborhood ties, the women decided to establish a partnership with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago. They are now on their tenth loan and all previous loans have been reimbursed without problems. The current loan will allow them to buy 20 bags of corn and peanuts, 400 kg of onions (fresh and dried), and a significant amount of seasonings. The grain retailers get their supplies on-site (especially on Tuesdays, market day) in Yanfolila from producers coming from surrounding villages. The seasoning sellers get their supplies each week in Sikasso from wholesalers in that area. These items are resold as retail, for cash, and sometimes on credit to customers who are mostly women from the town of Yanfolila.

Luisa is 38 years old and lives with her partner and their five children, who are 13, 11, 6, 3, and 9 months old. Luisa works as a cook for the local Municipal. She cooks for Wawawasi (\u201cBaby house\u201d in Quechua), its childcare program, preparing meals for 11 babies and 55 children each day. She cooks alone, though she works with two people who help her serve the food. She cooks mostly stews.\r\n\r\nLuisa also raises small animals like pigs, guinea pigs and hens at her home. Right now, she has one pig and 30 to 40 guinea pigs (a Peruvian delicacy). She raises the animals from the time they are small, then fattens them up and sells them to buyers, who travel to Andahuaylillas from Cusco and bring the animals back to the city to cook and serve in restaurants. Luisa is requesting a loan of 1800 soles to buy hens and guinea pigs. Hens cost 12.50 soles per pair, and guinea pigs cost 22 soles per pair. She expects to sell the hens for 40-45 soles apiece and the guinea pigs for 20-25 soles apiece in three to four months. Though hens sell for more when fully grown, they also cost more to feed and maintain, Luisa says. \r\n\r\nLuisa\u2019s goal for the future is to open a chain of hotels in Andahuayllillas. She says there are many tourists who visit the small town to see its church (which is nicknamed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sistine Chapel\u201d because of the elaborate 17th century frescos painted on its walls and ceiling), and she sees a promising business opportunity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":305544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy hens and guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Andahuaylillas - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":271.37},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":282.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":293.51},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":305.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":317.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":330.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.46},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.07},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.84},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.46,"local_amount":271.37,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":280.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409840},{"amount":94.1,"local_amount":282.29,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918287},{"amount":97.85,"local_amount":293.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":303.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139126},{"amount":101.76,"local_amount":305.28,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":315.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564746},{"amount":105.84,"local_amount":317.51,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":328.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998337},{"amount":109.99,"local_amount":330,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":341.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910604}],"funded_date":"2009-05-02T23:56:50Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T14:40:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":106706,"name":"Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb H\u1ea3i Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"H.

The work is very difficult because it requires long hours of labor in the blazing sun.  She goes on, despite this, because she knows that the business provides the living that supports her family.  Martina wants to continue improving her production and, in the future, set up another business.  This is her first MFP loan and she's very much looking forward to learning about and being part of a community bank, a new experience for her.  The money that she's requesting will be used to purchase bags and to pay to transport the potatoes that she will harvest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":334861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Pay for bags and transportation for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-12T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211861},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641388},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080827},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996968},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842307},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":89.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733910}],"funded_date":"2009-06-12T20:07:12Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":118994,"name":"Rizal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rizal J. is 33 years old and has two children.

She owns a business venture, selling BBQ (sausages, chicken, plantains).  Sapani has many years of experience in this business.  Sapani needs a loan of WST $2000 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business. Sapani wishes to develop her business and support her family.\r\n\r\nSapani joined SPBD, and this is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sapani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sapani S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Fofo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Fofo needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Fofo joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fofo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

With her partner she has 3 grown children, two of whom work and help their parents with the household expenses.  The youngest is in high school and is economically dependent.  Herminda and her partner have had a general store for more than 7 years.  Due to the economic problems that are affecting the country, her sales are variable.

Now she requests a loan to buy a greater quantity of merchandise for her business to ensure an increase in her sales so that she can support her daughter's education.\n\nThis is Herminda's 3rd loan cycle, and with the support that has been provided to her she has shown great economic improvement.
