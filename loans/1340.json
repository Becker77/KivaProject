","en":"Dinara is 39 years old, married and raising 4 children together with her husband. Dinara has a secondary education. She works as a cook at a men's lyceum.  Her husband seasonally does construction work. To provide the primary income for her family, Dinara is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 19 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 calf,  10 sheep, and also 1.44 hectares of land, where she primarily grows beans and potatoes. They sell the resulting harvest to wholesale distributors.  The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).

","en":"Jamila is 56 years old, married and raising 3 children together with her husband. The oldest daughter works in Russia, son works as a shepherd-for-hire in the village, and youngest daughter attends a school.  Jamila has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Jamila is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 14 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 2 calves. They prepare the hay themselves.  They are also involved in farming and grow corn and clover.

It is their first loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of her business. From this loan, she will purchase paddy (rice) in a large quantity for the growth of her business.\r\n\r\nHer future plan is to establish a rice mill and to provide a higher education to children.\r\n\r\nThe other 11 members of the group are Tapaswini, Janani, Sudhamayi, Yadabi, Lakshmi, Rajani, Tapisa, Malati, Jasobanti, Padmabati and Keshari.

She is a housewife who received an education up to class X (grade 10). Her husband is illiterate and can sign only his name. Their one son is receiving an education and is studying for his BA (Bachelor of Arts).  They live in their own kaccha house (made of straw and mud).\r\n\r\nHer husband is a businessman.  He works hard and always has high quality products, which are sold locally but he has to face tough competition with the other businessmen. He does not get enough profit to cope with the finances required to run his family well so they decided to switch over to another business.\r\n\r\nShankari heard that BJS offers loans to women in the community and she applied for a loan to help her husband to buy a cow.

His business is still  in an early stage, but he manages everything successfully. Maxim was lucky to be able to buy a house with a large land plot in credit: last year he already finished paying for his house. Now Maximum actively develops his business and this year he is installing heating in his greenhouses.\r\n\r\nMaxim is the head of his own family and tries to solve problems on his own, but also listens to his parents' advice. This year, on the advice of his father, he applied for a loan to buy  steel for a  boiler as well as heater hoses. Now Maxim will be able to harvest produce earlier, which makes him happy. He would like to provide a good quality of living for his family and  set a good example for his son.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1525552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase and install heating system in greenhouses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-02-12T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-14T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":591.73,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maksym","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":853.14,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":10068.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":296.86,"payment_id":530043548},{"amount":855.13,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10068.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":294.87,"payment_id":542536338}],"funded_date":"2014-02-17T17:22:34Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T13:55:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":668280,"name":"Nulu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nulu is widowed with four children and none of her children go to school.

The tireless, determined and loving mothers strive hard to give the best to their family and kids. They live in a village and most of them are cultivators and weavers.

The income is irregular and not reliable for monthly expenditures including school fees and other necessary expenses. At the beginning of the year, they usually take a loan from moneylenders to meet their educational expenses. Paying the monthly interest and saving money to repay the capital prevents them from paying the monthly school fees on time.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva education loan, she will pay for her son's school admission fees, textbooks & stationary, other annual examination fees and necessary expenses.

They have two children who are the only people who depend on them.  They have their house on a purchase agreement, on which they are paying installments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Edwin sells eggs.  He orders them from a poultry farm which delivers to his door.  From there he takes them on his motorcycle and sells them to customers in the area.  He has been doing this for four years.\r\n\r\nWhen he was younger, he worked as a laborer in building work, but he stopped in 2004 when he found a job on the poultry farm.  He used this experience to learn how to start his own business and in 2009 he decided to go it alone and start selling eggs independently.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to buy more as the eggs at the moment are available at a good price.

In January, 2014, 13 poor women came out and formed a Self Help Group (SHG) named Maa Durga to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to develop their existing businesses to earn more income. Jayanti, the tallest lady standing middle in the photo, is one of them. She is a very active and confident woman of 42 years. She lives with her husband and only son of 20 years. \r\n\r\nJayanti is running a general shop in a stall adjoining to her home with items like soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, biscuits, chocolate, dry foods, etc. She started this business four years ago with a small investment. Her husband helps her in managing this shop. He brings different items from the nearest small town five kilometers away. Currently, Jayanti is earning a monthly income of 3,000 INR. Apart from this, she has also income from cultivation. But the total income she earns from the above businesses is not sufficient for her to manage her family and save a little for the future. So she wants to expand her business to generate some extra income. \r\n\r\nFrom the present loan she wants to buy soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, biscuits, chocolate, dry foods, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs and she will be able to replenish her stock frequently. She hopes that this investment will give her more income and enough savings that she will be able to construct a house for her family. \r\n\r\nThe other 12 members of the group also do petty businesses like tailoring, vegetable cultivation, general shop, foot wear vending, puffed rice selling , cloth business, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1528021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He requests 5,000,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam. After finishing his house, his family will live in a comfortable and warm place. Living in a house is much better than living in a ger. A high quality house will greatly reduce the consumption of coal and will have less heat loss through walls and windows. The main cause of air pollution in Mongolia is the burning of coal and therefore, a decrease in coal usage will impact the air quality.

She is a 36-year-old single mother and head of household.  She was a teen mother of two daughters.  The first was born when she was 17, and the second when she was 20 years old.  They are now 19 and 16 years old, respectively.  Her eldest daughter, Laura, is in school and also works.  Her youngest daughter, Andrea, is in 11th grade, and is about to begin her undergraduate studies.  It is not easy to raise two daughters, while always dreaming of continuing your education.  Thank God, with the help of her mother, she has been able to do so.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is working as a nanny for a family, she sells items from various catalogs, and takes care of dogs.  All in all, she is willing to do whatever it takes.  She has experience in beauty and cosmetics, but does not have the certification to validate it.  Her greatest dream is to have a technical degree.  Being a teenage mother, she has had to start working and was not able to enter higher education.  At the moment, she has the opportunity of getting a higher education at Campo Alto, and earning a degree at the same time as her daughters.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys cosmetology, esthetics and physical therapy.  She wants to show her daughters that it is possible, and that with effort and dedication one can reach their goals.  For this reason, she has turned to Kiva for help in making her dream of having a technical degree in cosmetology and esthetics, a reality.    This will allow her to work at a good job, with better wages.  She will also be able to use her new knowledge to help her daughters with their personal appearance and their self-esteem.  She will be able to simultaneously help her daughters make their dreams come true, support their education, and become a professional along with her daughters.  \r\n\r\nTogether, they can help each other get ahead, improve their quality of life, improve their financial situation, have their own home, make connections so they can work in national and international companies, or start their own business.  The future is in knowing how to do things well, with good conscience and love."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1528012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay for a semester of school.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-13T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-15T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mildred Helena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":153750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069826},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":153750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882773},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-10T09:23:13Z","rounded_local_amount":153750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202137},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":153750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286278},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":153750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224985}],"funded_date":"2014-02-13T19:20:33Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Roberto Henry"}},{"id":668428,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elizabeth es una microempresaria clienta de Kubo Financiero y esta es su historia:\n\nElizabeth tiene 33 a\u00f1os, es casada desde hace 17 a\u00f1os y tiene dos hijas: de 15 y 10 a\u00f1os cada una, estudiando las dos; su esposo se llama Ricardo y es taxista. \n\nElla actualmente es empleada y trabaja en un taller de costura, su actividad es planchar blusas, pantalones, faldas o cualquier prenda que sea entregada para planchar, le pagan por trabajo y tambi\u00e9n revisa que las prendas vayan sin ning\u00fan defecto.\n\nEl proyecto actual de Elizabeth es independizarse y establecer su taller de planchado y costura, motivo por el cual solicita este pr\u00e9stamo; en espec\u00edfico lo utilizar\u00e1 para comprar burros de planchar para arrancar el negocio. \n","en":"Elizabeth is a micro entrepreneurial client of Kubo Financiero and this is her story:\r\n\r\nElizabeth is 33 years old and has been married for 17 years.

June 30 in Bogot\u00e1. She is 19 years old and lives with her parents, grandmother and sister. She studied at the Celestin Freinet Academic and Technical Academy from preschool, through Primary and Secondary school. When she graduated from secondary school she took additional studies at Sena (The National Service of Learning) as a technician in Hotel Management and Tourism for 4 years. She graduated in 2011 getting her degree and certification from Sena. \r\n\r\nHaving completed those studies she became interested in Medicine and Accounting.  She wanted to enter university but there was no vacancies in the field of Medicine. So she looked for other universities saw some possibilities but they were very expensive. She came to Campo Alto and learned about the courses offered at Las Mercedes and entered the Accounting program at the beginning of 2012.\r\n\r\nNow she is entering her last semester at Las Mercedes. She is a person with principles and values like respect, honesty, cheerful and happy to share with the people around her who wish the best for her. She is somewhat intolerant of people who are jealous or immature. In her spare time she listens to music from the 70's and 80's and sometimes plays basketball or rides a bike.

de las maneras que puede brindarle ayuda a la gente es anud\u00e1ndole a mejorar la salud oral, a ella le encanta arreglar dientes, revisar bocas y piensa que si una persona con una boca sana y una linda sonrisa se va a ver y sentir bien, va a ser una persona feliz.  \nEl motivo por el cual ella decidi\u00f3 estudiar salud oral es porque quiere en un futuro no muy lejano con ayuda de Dios y de la familia poder especializarse y ser una de las mejores odont\u00f3logas en el pa\u00eds y claro poder viajar a otros pa\u00edses y antes poder tener el propio consultorio, tener gente que le ayude y que ella pueda ayudar, la raz\u00f3n por la cual ella quiere la ayuda que le brinda KIVA es porque a ella le toca trabajar y estudiar al mismo tiempo y ahora que est\u00e1 haciendo las practicas solo puede trabajar medio tiempo y lo que gana no le alcanza para cubrir los gastos de la casa  y para pagar el estudio, ella obtuvo la colaboraci\u00f3n de kiva el primer semestre y a\u00f1ora que en este

She decided to study oral health because she has always been interested in it.  She is passionate about being able to help others and thinks that one way she can help people is by helping them improve their oral health. She loves to fix teeth and examine mouths and thinks that if a person has a healthy mouth and a nice smile, they will look and feel good and be a happy person. \r\n\r\nThe reason why she decided to study oral health is that she hopes that in the near future, with God's and her family's help, she will be able to specialize and be one of the best dentists in the country, travel to other countries, have her own office, have people who help her and people who she can help. This is why she wants the help that KIVA provides. She needs to work and study at the same time, and now while she is doing her internship she can only work part-time.  What she is earning is not enough to cover the household expenses and her studies. She had help from KIVA her first semester and she hopes that in the second semester they will continue to provide this great help. She hopes that her dreams will not be frustrated by having to leave school. \r\n\r\nAll her life she has dreamed of being independent and having her own office. She is sure that with God's help and her strong desire, she will achieve her goal - everything in life is achievable if you set your mind to it and if you want to get ahead. She is putting all her effort into this and will not let anything get in the way of achieving her goal. She is doing this for her daughters, too, because she wants to give them a good future and a sense of well being. She wants them to study and become professionals so that in the future they can help people in whatever way is needed.

She wants to request a loan from Kiva as her family is in a favorable financial situation and the installment fees are not high. They live in a rented apartment. \n\nHer father died when she was small and since then her mother has taken charge of everything financial, including education and basic necessities. Her mother works as an operator in a sewing company. Her salary isn't high enough to pay their food, rent and services. So a loan from Kiva would allow her to finish her studies in a satisfactory manner as she postponed her first semester of practicum due to lack of financial resources. \n\nHer mother was without work and Yerly had to find work, in a restaurant as a waitress to help with the household expenses. Now Yerly is without work and her mother is who is paying for her studies at Campo Alto. She hopes to graduate to help earn what is needed for her family and enjoy a better quality of living. \n\nYerly is grateful for this opportunity offered her to finish her studies. She has had experiences which really affect her. After the death of her father she has dedicated herself to helping her mother get ahead in spite of the difficulties and particulars that have befallen her and her mom.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1512698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester's tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-13T19:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-15T19:10:08Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yerly Gihovana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":304125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069650},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":152062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882594},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":152062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201958},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":304125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286099}],"funded_date":"2014-02-13T23:14:59Z","paid_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":658779,"name":"Lina Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lina mar\u00eda es una joven de 25 a\u00f1os de edad, quien a su corta edad es una mujer echada para adelante, desde que finalizo los estudios como bachiller en el a\u00f1o 2006, se ha desarrollado laboral mente en varios oficios, pero a pesar de que ha adquirido bastante experiencia laboral, siente que puede dar m\u00e1s de ella, y que el trabajo podr\u00eda ser mejor recompensado si adquiere un titulo t\u00e9cnico en lo laboral. \nDesde que se gradu\u00f3 como bachiller, ha so\u00f1ado con volver a un aula de clases, seguir aprendiendo  m\u00e1s cosas que son necesarias para la vida personal y laboral, sue\u00f1a con poder brindarle a los hijos un mejor futuro ya que  sabe que el estudio es la mejor herencia que los padres pueden dejar a los hijos, y lo m\u00e1s importante, ser alguien de motivo y orgullo para ellos , por eso se encuentra decidida a luchar por los sue\u00f1os y  hacerlos realidad con esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n.  \nElla desea continuar con los estudios y en alg\u00fan momento ver recompensado todo el esfuerzo y sacrificio para tener una vejez digna, haber cumplido los sue\u00f1os y ver que tambi\u00e9n se puedan cumplir los de los hijos \nEsta segura que con la ayuda de kiva para pagar el estudio, y la ayuda de Dios para que le de mucha sabidur\u00eda, es posible lograr hasta lo imposible.\n","en":"Lina Mar\u00eda is a 25-year-old young woman, who at her young age is a self-assured woman.

This is why she has decided to struggle to make her dreams come true with effort and dedication.\r\n\r\nShe wants to continue her studies and be rewarded for all the effort and sacrifice in order to have a dignified old age, having reached her dreams and be able to fulfill those of her children.\r\n\r\nShe is sure that with the help of Kiva to finance her studies, and the help of God for giving her wisdom, it is possible to achieve the impossible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1513431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay one semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-13T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-15T19:10:09Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lina Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069656},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882600},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480201964},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286105},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":146435.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224812}],"funded_date":"2014-02-13T20:43:26Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T10:51:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joelle Kuiper","image":1765797}},{"id":661700,"name":"Tatiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ella es tatiana, estudia un t\u00e9cnico en administraci\u00f3n hoteler\u00eda en  campo alto, escogi\u00f3 esta carrera porque le gusta, ya que es una profesi\u00f3n que requiere de estar a menudo en relaci\u00f3n con las personas y de una u otra manera se aprende a tolerar, tener paciencia, ser persona y ser humano con la gente.  \nUno de los motivos fundamentales es querer salir adelante, tener un trabajo y una profesi\u00f3n digna, verse como una gran mujer profesional, llegar a donde quiere, y con grandes esfuerzos seguir estudiando, conocer m\u00e1s sobre lo que estudia, tener un mejor campo a nivel educativo, estar bien econ\u00f3micamente y personalmente.\nEl segundo motivo es la familia y los papas, que de una u otra manera la sacaron adelante y le ense\u00f1aron que lo que uno quiere, lo consigue con esfuerzo y es as\u00ed como ella les puede agradecer todo lo que en el momento hicieron.\nSiempre mantiene agradecida con aquellas personas que le dieron y aun le dan \u00e1nimo, que la felicitan y le suben la moral cuando lo necesita, que la apoyaron desde el primer momento que empez\u00f3 a estudiar y estaban con ella cuando lo necesitaba, es una chica que como todos tiene sue\u00f1os, aspiraciones, metas y propuestas, quiere alcanzar esas metas  y no se detiene,  cada d\u00eda se  enamora m\u00e1s de la carrera y se levanta con \u00e1nimo para lograr lo que quiere ser y obtener lo que quiere de la mejor manera. \n","en":"Tatiana studies the career of hotel administration in Campo Alto.

She had to postpone her studies because she got pregnant at a young age but in her mind she had never left behind the desire to get ahead.  She waited a long year so that her daughter could grow a little more.  She wanted to finish her studies and graduate so that she could provide a good future for her daughter.  Finishing school at age 17, she had placed for herself the goal of studying in a university but for lack of time she hadn\u2019t been able to enter as her daughter was still young and she couldn't do much more than care for her.\r\n\r\nNow, at age 19, she landed a stable job where the ease of her schedule gives her enough time with her daughter and also makes it easy for her to study.  She found in Campo Alto the opportunity to study as in the institute they offered her a schedule that fits with what her work requires.  At this time her goal for the future is to graduate from Campo Alto in early childhood care and thus be able to improve academically and be able to dedicate more time to what she has always liked. \r\n\r\nThe agreement that Campo Alto is offering with Kiva would be of great help to her as she is the only one who pays for her studies and the value of the monthly installments is a little costly.  With the money that she could save in the payment of her monthly installments she can invest in the things that her studies and her daughter require from her. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1528062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester\u2019s tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-13T20:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-15T20:20:07Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica  Yusbreidy  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":133250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069832},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":133250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882779},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-10T09:23:13Z","rounded_local_amount":133250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202143},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":133250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286284},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":133250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224991}],"funded_date":"2014-02-13T21:25:54Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melanie Snellings","image":null}},{"id":668445,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":878.6,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wholesale fish.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nIrenea hopes to have a grocery store someday and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband is a cattle farmer, raising his cattle in fields ideal for grazing.  Mehri herself tends to their home, and has recently decided to start working as a seamstress.  She already knows how to cut fabrics to size and sew them together to make Tajikistani women's clothing; however, her sewing machine is old, and it's difficult to sew with because of technical problems.  As such, she is requesting a loan to buy a new sewing machine.

","en":"Nilufar works as a seamstress in the city of Khujand of the B. Gafurov district. She is a young, but already divorced 22 year-old woman.  She has no children from her marriage.  Her family life did not go well and she returned to her parents' house after the divorce and lives together with her father and mother.  Nilufar is self-sufficient and independent.

Yavan district.  She is 53 years old.  She is a mother of four sons, all of whom are grown.  Three of her older sons are working abroad.  The youngest son is 23 years old.  He attends a university.  Tutiyobegim is involved in embroidery.  She makes national embroideries on fabrics by hand.  With the help of a sewing machine, she sketches a silhouette of a future drawing and then embroiders with color threads by hand.  This craft is passed on from generation to generation.  Tutiyobegim decided to earn a living with her talent 3 years ago.  Embroideries of this style are classics.  She started to accept orders for embroidery and make a profit.  Tutiyobegim was happy that she did not have to waste her time and earn a living from home.  She decided to buy a sewing machine because the machine that she has is old, and fabrics and threads.  The sewing machine costs a lot of money, and Tutiyobegim decided to request a loan.  She hopes that she would be able to accept more orders and have more profit.  Tutiyobegim is saving money to help her son hold a wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1525799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine, fabrics and threads","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"A.

","en":"Saparkul is 50 years old, a widow and raised 5 children after her husband's death. Two of her daughters are married, the oldest son lives with Saparkul, the middle son works in the capital of Kyrgyzstan, the youngest son works in Russia, and both sons help the mother financially.  Saparkul has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Saparkul is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 6 dairy cows.  Saparkul daily milks her cows that provide a good yield and sells milk to wholesale distributors.  From March through November, Saparkul sells milk products, such as butter, kurut and kefir. The monthly income amounts to 20,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Saparkul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows in order to increase livestock headcount and also to increase the monthly income from milk products sales. Saparkul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock

To provide the primary income for her family, Barchynay is involved in animal husbandry, having started 6 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 5 dairy cows and 1 horse. She keeps the livestock in the household in the winter; she has a barn on her property.  In the summer, Barchynay and her husband take the livestock to a pasture. The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Barchynay requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows in order to increase livestock headcount. Barchynay plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for her children's future education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1525846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Terek village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-14T02:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-16T02:00:04Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":78.17,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barchynay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":987.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":987.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":987.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463102},{"amount":909.33,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":78.17,"payment_id":610751141}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T20:46:05Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":668732,"name":"Lita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lita is 57-years-old, married and has six children.

He lives in the Qubadiyon district.  Muzafar is an exemplary family man.  He is 64 years old.  Muzafar thinks that nothing is ever too late to start and decided to open a business in the animal husbandry area.  He is planning to buy calves at a district livestock market and raise them in a cowshed.  He has space for livestock and feed.  Muzafar is treating this business responsibly because this new business will become the primary source of income for his family.  Many young men and men leave the country in search of work due to the lack of work here.  But Muzafar does not want to leave his relatives and tries to find a source of income without leaving his homeland.  Muzafar is ready to start the new business, but cannot open the business due to insufficient initial capital.  Muzafar is requesting help.  He is planing to buy calves with the sum of $2000.  Help him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1526760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy calves in order to start his own business and have a source of income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qubadiyon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-02-14T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-16T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muzafar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":149.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":148.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":153.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":153.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":163.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":163.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":173.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":176.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":180.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":185.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":184.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.72},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":149.81,"local_amount":149.81,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":149.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467969439},{"amount":148.75,"local_amount":148.75,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":148.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479189730},{"amount":153.72,"local_amount":153.72,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":153.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490883140},{"amount":153.7,"local_amount":153.7,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":153.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504310181},{"amount":163.2,"local_amount":163.2,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":163.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517591983},{"amount":163.9,"local_amount":163.9,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":163.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530087629},{"amount":167.06,"local_amount":167.06,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":167.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542568799},{"amount":899.86,"local_amount":899.86,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":899.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561700798}],"funded_date":"2014-03-11T23:21:30Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:41:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":668764,"name":"Belina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Belina is 46 years old, married but has no children.

According to her, being a single parent is quite difficult but she doesn't have any choice but to strive harder for a better way of living.\r\n\r\nVisitacion runs a retail business in their village. She realizes that generated income from her business is not enough to cover all of their household expenditures, especially her children's education needs.

","en":"Gulnara is a  50-year-old woman who is married and raising five children with her husband.  She has a secondary education.  She is also a responsible, punctual and enterprising woman who knows how to run her business and how to invest her money wisely.  Her neighbors and friends describe her as an exemplary woman.  \r\n\r\nGulnara's main activity is animal husbandry.  She started in this business 12 years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS).  She has everything that she needs to raise livestock.  In the winter she keeps her animals at home, while in the summer she sends them to graze in distant pastures. \r\n\r\nThanks to her very hard work, Gulnara currently owns two dairy cows, one horse and four sheep.  She makes a monthly income of 11,000 som (KGS).  Eager to further develop her farming business, she is taking a loan from the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\".  She will use her loan to buy some young bulls in order to increase her cattle headcount.  She plans to re-invest the earnings from this loan into further increasing her number of farm animals.  She is also planning to save enough money to repair her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1526998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her husband has been running a food stall where he sells different types of edible items such as samosa, vegetable rolls, chicken tikka, Kabab paratha, etc. He is the one responsible to feed the entire family and manage the household.\r\n\r\nNasreen's husband needs to purchase different types of edible and other items for his business so that he can increase the size of his business, improve his sales growth, and earn maximum profit. But due to his unfavorable financial position, he is not able to purchase these items for his business. Therefore Nasreen has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase the above items for his business. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

Due to insufficient financial resources her husband is not in a position to incur further expenses on his carrier vehicle for business purpose. Therefore Safia has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to repair the carrier vehicle for business purposes.

His family's primary source of income comes from the plants they grow and sell, and the animals they raise. Alejandro is excited about acquiring his 10 cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester because it will help him better take advantage of the abundant animal waste on-site. The digester will treat the manure through anaerobic digestion, providing Alejandro and his family with renewable, methane-rich biogas fuel and potent biofertilizer. The biogas will be used to displace the expensive, fossil-fuel derived propane the family currently uses to cook and heat bathwater, using the biogas burners included in the Sistema Biobolsa kit. Alejandro will apply the biofertilizer to his fields, improving soil quality and crop yield without having to resort to petroleum-based agrochemical fertilizers. The digester will help him and his family save money and reduce their farm's environmental impact.

They have all known each other for a long time and know each other well. They have many clients, mostly women. The whole group took out a loan of 230,000 YER.\r\n\r\nYusra is the group leader.  She is a 32-year-old married woman with a child.  She has been operating a sewing business for over five years. Yusra chose this business because she has loved it since childhood. She started her business with a small amount of money to buy patterns of fabric and robes for sewing.

and hard-working woman, 50 years of age. She is married and has six children. Her children love and appreciate their parents very much. All of her children already have families on their own and live separately, but always remember to visit their parents and also help out financially. Sharifa and her husband live in a rural village in a small house. They also try to work to support themselves.\r\n\r\nSharifa has been collaborating with Arvand since 2007 and is a responsible client. She took out loans a number of times in order to launch and develop her business. She still attempts to grow her business. Sharifa and her husband raise livestock for sale. She learned how do it when she was still very oung. Sharifa says that, she and her husband improved their life conditions, after having started the collaboration with Arvand, because prior to that she used to lack own funds and a possibility to develop her business thanks to which she supports herself. At present Sharifa has several heads of  livestock, soon ready to be resold. This is why she wants to buy some more  livestock for fattening and resale. This is why she applied to Arvand for a loan to buy cattle. Sharifa hopes for a positive outcome and thanks Arvand for its support in advance.

For more than two years she has worked as a tailor and hairdresser, a business she carries out from her house. She needs the loan to buy a variety of materials for her work, such as fabric, thread, needles, scissors etc.\r\n\r\nMaria's work brings in a large part of her income. With the loan she hopes that her workload and sales will increase, and this will help her greatly, as she doesn't currently have all the products she needs to fulfil the orders that come in daily from her customers. Thanks to the loan she will be able to boost her household income and improve her family's quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, Maria wants to grow her business and continue to support her family and give them a better life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1528743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, thread, needles, scissors etc. for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2014-02-14T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-16T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468035365},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T19:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479253557},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490949850},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504388446},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517665449},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530167203},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542646629},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T14:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561781249},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579738537},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595306406}],"funded_date":"2014-02-14T21:42:20Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T15:08:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Brown","image":560642}},{"id":669045,"name":"Sokchan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokchan is a horse-drawn-cart driver and his wife is a garment worker.

Sharon is 24 years old and was asked the following questions by a staff member of the Institute:\r\n\r\nWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute and what classes do you enjoy most?\r\n\r\n\u201cI am studying Bachelor of Business Administration. The classes I enjoy the most are mathematics or any other classes that have something to do with numbers. I enjoy my numbers and sometimes consciousness classes because I get to understand the self.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after Graduation?\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to work in the finance department because I like numbers. I would ideally like to work in the Western Cape or Harare, Zimbabwe. I think that going back home and sharing my knowledge would help my country. I would like to travel because I enjoy visiting new places.\u201d\r\n\r\nTell us about your background.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was born in Harare, Zimbabwe. I come from a family of two. My father was an electrician before he passed away in 1999, when I was only six. That left me and my little brother in the care of my mother who was not working at the time. My mother moved to South Africa in 2007, where she has been working as a domestic worker. I did my primary and secondary education in Zimbabwe and then I followed her to South Africa in 2010 and continued my schooling here. I am not yet married and have no children.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\r\n\r\n\u201cDuring my spare time I enjoy watching TV, reading novels and looking after small children. Sometimes during the holidays I volunteer at a children\u2019s cr\u00e8che just to help look after children as I love spending time with them.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow will the Kiva loan change your life?\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Kiva loan will help me to pursue my dreams, as I\u2019ll be able to focus more on my studies and not stress about finances.

Ashley is 21 years old and was asked the following questions by a staff member of the Institute:\r\n\r\nWhat do you study at the Maharishi Institute and what classes do you enjoy most?\r\n\r\n\u201cI am studying Bachelor of Business Administration and enjoy all the classes but especially the meditation, as it has helped me to manage classes that I wasn\u2019t very good at before, like Mathematics.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduation?\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter graduating, I would like to work for a large listed company, preferably in the HR department, as I believe that HR plays a central role in business. While working I would like to study Human Resources part-time through the University of South Africa.  After some initial experience I would like to work in other African countries.\u201d\r\n\r\nTell us about your background.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was born and bred in Soweto in 1992. My father passed away in 1996, so my siblings and I were raised by a single parent. I had four siblings but the eldest one passed away in 2006. My mother is almost 60 years old and works as a tailor from our home.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\r\n\r\n\u201cI spend most of my time channeling my energy to positive things like writing poetry for my music career, playing soccer and reading novels.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow will the Kiva loan change your life?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would help me to get to school every day and on time, as I would be able to change the way that I get to university.

Rejeki Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sari Rejeki Group succeeded in repaying its previous loan even though they were one day over the due date. This is due to the inexpensive price of piglets today. Most of the group members raise sows and sell piglets. Because they were selling the piglets at the same time, the price of piglets became cheap. Ni Luh, as head of the group, feels the same thing. Luckily, she has an additional business as a farmer and her husband as a carpenter so that she does not lack for everyday needs. Ni Luh and all members of Sari Rejeki Group agreed to continue lending and changing the methods of raising pigs to increase the selling price. Sari Rejeki Group will resume their borrowing from MUK with an increased loan size. To increase the price of piglets, they changed the method of raising the pigs. Some members still raise sows and the other members raise super quality pigs for fattening or local pigs for pork barbecue. With this method, the sales of pigs will remain in this group only.

determined guy. He is not yet married and lives with his parents in a small village. After graduation for a local school, Bahrom was not able to enroll in college to receive a higher education because of financial problems in his family. But from a young age, Bahrom had entrepreneurial qualities, that help him not to sit still but rather to come up with different kinds of business to make a profit. <br \/><br \/>Now, Bahrom is engaged in his own business. He sells wallpaper and glue for repairs of apartments and homes. Bahrom buys his goods at the large wholesale bazaar and transports them to his village for sale. He already has regular customers, and from his business Bahrom receives a good income. As a result, he wants to expand his business, to get a large profit, since he needs to save money for the future and when he will get married he will need money. <br \/><br \/>Therefore he is not applying to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to purchase wallpaper and glue for repairs for future resale.

He holds a graduate degree in Film and Screenwriting from NYU and a Bachelor's degree in Theater and English Literature with a concentration on Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nHowever, after graduating, Nick surprisingly found himself somewhere other than theater. For 15 years, he acted as a marketing executive, leading development and executive teams in TV, Print, and Digital marketing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Nick was laid off in 2012, but instead of feeling down and discouraged, he sought out the silver lining. \u201cMost people would have been devastated at being laid off, but it made me very happy and excited. I figured it would be the perfect time to do something that I\u2019ve been passionate about for decades.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn April 2012, Nick opened First Folio Productions, where he introduces Shakespeare to today\u2019s younger generations through digital textbooks that are accessible via iPad, iPhone, Android, and any laptop operating system. One of First Folio Productions\u2019 first products was a digital textbook of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHamlet,\u201d which included a modern film adaptation of the play and original recordings of two songs. Nick says that the advantage of digital textbooks is that \u201cunlike paper textbooks, digital textbooks can also include audio and video content as a way to bring Shakespeare\u2019s great work to life for the younger generation and students of all ages.\u201d \r\n\r\nSeveral schools around the country have turned to Nick\u2019s digital textbooks to teach their students famous Shakespeare works like Othello, Hamlet, and Romeo and Juliet. Now, Nick needs your help. With this loan, Nick will strengthen his marketing efforts with online ads and brochures. Nick will also use the loan to pay for the legal fees associated with copyrighting the textbooks and audio and visual content. \r\n\r\nHelp this Shakespeare aficionado by contributing to his loan
