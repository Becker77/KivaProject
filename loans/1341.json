She has never had access to an education, but received just 2 months of literacy teaching. She is a widow, as her husband passed away recently. They had 7 children, but one died. The rest all live in separate households. Two grandchildren live with \u00c1ngela and are dependent on her.<br \/><br \/>\u00c1ngela has been running a small shop for a year. She learnt the trade from a neighbour and then decided to do it for herself. This was because she doesn't get an income from her children yet she has had to look after her two grandchildren since their mother died, leaving \u00c1ngela with the responsibility of caring for them. This is her first business and her shop is at the entrance to the city. One of her daughters helps her with the business, and their working day lasts from 6.30am to 7pm.<br \/> <br \/>\u00c1ngela  is asking for this loan to buy produce to stock her shop so she can earn more money, which will help to support her two young orphaned grandchildren. Through the loan she will have a bigger variety of produce, and this will generate more income so she will be able to cover the needs of her grandchildren, aged 12 and 8. <br \/><br \/>\u00c1ngela's dream is to offer the best products to her customers and to grow her store, as she wants her grandchildren to be able to go to school and not end up like her. This was the dream of her deceased daughter too (the children's mother), who was not able to give to her children what she had always wanted. With this loan, \u00c1ngela will be able to make her shop a success and she will be able to provide her grandchildren with an education and a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1528771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Vinera has a secondary-specialized education. She graduated from college with the financial analyst profession.  She married Akpar in 1988.  The family is very friendly and support each other with everything.  After the breakup of the Soviet Union, having divided their land, they became involved in animal husbandry and farming with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Vinera's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 horse, 1 bull, 20 sheep, and also a 2.22 hectare land plot, where she grows beans and perennial herbs. They sell the resulting harvest to wholesale distributors.  Additionally, Vinera is involved in reselling potatoes and apples.   In order to further develop her business, Vinera requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. The sheep will stay in their household after the purchase.  The livestock will be under a shepherd's watch in the summer.  Vinera plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to buy consumer electronics."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1528446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tash-Kuduk","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-14T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-16T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":42.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vinera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7371},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7294},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7507},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7726},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7951},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8183},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8422},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8668},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8920},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9181},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9448},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9329}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":145.58,"local_amount":7371,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7440.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467831152},{"amount":144.06,"local_amount":7294,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":7363.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053584},{"amount":148.26,"local_amount":7507,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7578.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749742},{"amount":152.59,"local_amount":7726,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":7799.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178484},{"amount":157.03,"local_amount":7951,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":8026.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463105},{"amount":161.61,"local_amount":8183,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8260.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947103},{"amount":166.33,"local_amount":8422,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440452},{"amount":167.1,"local_amount":8668,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8750.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.09,"payment_id":561578265},{"amount":171.96,"local_amount":8920,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":9004.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.21,"payment_id":579488863},{"amount":518.34,"local_amount":27958,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":28223.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.84,"payment_id":595436061}],"funded_date":"2014-03-01T02:07:44Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":669163,"name":"Iman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iman is 22 years old, married and lives in Gaza with her husband and three children.

She is very grateful to everyone who helps her to achieve success with this loan.\r\n\r\nRyada's Startup Loan is exclusively for borrowers who are beginning new enterprises, not for existing projects. To qualify, a borrower must show a clear business plan and realistic potential for success. The borrower must also invest their own money and resources into at least 50 percent of the start up enterprise. Ryada believes strongly in the potential of these borrowers and grants them a three month grace period to help them get their business off the ground.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1529107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

He has requested a Kiva loan to boost his working capital.

Moses plans to expand his business by opening additional outlets in the future.\r\n\r\nMoses feels fortunate to be connected to Kiva lenders. He explains that it is very difficult to access micro-loans in Zambia and interests rates are very high. He anticipates his profits will increase by having more working capital to serve customers.

She has one son and two daughters. She is hard working and at this time, she does things cautiously. Her husband is engaged in carpentry work. She weaves traditional wrap-arounds and supplies her products to shops in the market. She does not weave alone but engages professional weavers. Some of her products, as shown in the picture, are beautiful and costly too.\r\n\r\nZamdeihching had two handlooms. When she first took the loan, she bought another handloom. With three handlooms, she was able to engage weavers and increase the number of products. In a week, she was able to earn good money and with the profits she made, she bought one more handloom. Now she has all together four handlooms. \r\n\r\nThough Zamdeihching faces many difficulties in earning an income for the family while she is looking after her young children, she somehow can afford to buy essential materials like cooking gas, blankets and others for the family.

","en":"Manzura is an active, toiling village woman from the Shahrituz region. She is a married women of 31 years, raising three children. Manzura and her family grow crops, just as many rural residents do. This craft is passed to them by their ancestors from generation to generation. Still in childhood, they get involved in working the land and with livestock. Now at home, Manzura has two dairy cows for the family's needs. She cares for the cows herself. <br \/><br \/>Manzura decided to turn her favorite activities into a business and to engage in the buying and selling of cattle.

in Spitamen and still lives there today. She is 42 years old and the mother of six children. She has a very close-knit family who always support each other. Her husband loads freight at the regional railroad station. Sometimes her older sons can also work there part-time and add their share to the family budget.\r\n\r\nMuhayo has enjoyed sewing traditional dresses since she was young. She always embroidered elegant dresses for her sisters and neighbors, and now she is an experienced professional seamstress. She has many customers and sews linens to order in addition to her traditional dresses. She has been a client of MDO Arvand for a few years, which has enabled her to expand her business activities.\r\n\r\nMuhayo has applied for a loan again, but this time it is for a different purpose. Her son is getting ready to go to Russia and she is going to buy him a plane ticket, although she does not have enough money right now. Muhayo thanks Kiva in advance for the support over the years and, of course, for their confidence.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1521934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a plane ticket","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-02-14T21:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-16T21:30:10Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhayo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":103.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":106.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":110.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2014-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":125.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":130.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":134.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":139.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":143.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":152.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.35,"local_amount":103.15,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T11:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":107.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459144430},{"amount":23.11,"local_amount":106.65,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":110.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960251},{"amount":23.89,"local_amount":110.26,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":114.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479181013},{"amount":24.7,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":118.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875610},{"amount":25.54,"local_amount":117.86,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":122.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302837},{"amount":26.4,"local_amount":121.86,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":126.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585640},{"amount":27.3,"local_amount":125.99,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":131.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081220},{"amount":28.22,"local_amount":130.26,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":135.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562099},{"amount":123.49,"local_amount":569.97,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":592.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694790}],"funded_date":"2014-02-18T06:59:12Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":669235,"name":"Raeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raeda is a 41-year-old widow from Jericho.

Bweyogerere Secondary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the students. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nBweyogerere Secondary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank. Ismail ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1160,"image":{"id":1524129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

Approximately 20 years ago she began selling footwear for all kinds of customers at excellent prices and good quality, which allowed her to become well-known in the area, and to attain the career that she has. This inspired her to request the support of a loan to boost her inventory, with which she will buy footwear wholesale so she can meet the demand that increases during the school year.

She is 35 years old and a mother of a schoolchild. \r\n\r\nShe struggles for her daily cost of living. Sinat works for others for a fee and has a vegetable growing business. For several years, she has been involved in her current business. She is able to earn up to 16,600 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nThis new loan becomes the third loan for her. She has fully repaid back her past loan, and it has helped her to support her living expenses.

He was born in a rural area in the J. Rasulov region, where he still lives. He is married and has two children. In his younger years, Ulugbek was not able to study because his family had financial difficulties. This is why he used to help his father raise livestock from childhood on. His wife is a homemaker and dedicates herself to raising their children, but when she has time she also helps Ulugbek.\r\n\r\nUlugbek raises livestock. In addition, he earns extra money by working as a carpeting contractor at private building sites. Since he did not study himself and faced many hardships in his life due to lack of education, he would really like his children to study and   obtain decent jobs in the future. Ulugbek works night and day to achieve this goal. Recently, a friend of his who works in the Russian Federation told him that there is a need for carpenters there, and encourage Ulugbek to come. Now Ulugbek plans to go to Russia as a migrant worker. Since he lacks the necessary cash, he has applied for a loan in order to buy an airline ticket. He very much hopes to be able to increase his earnings and send money to his wife. Ulugbek thanks Kiva in advance for supporting him  during a difficult time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1515791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy an airline ticket.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

One of her sons has been running his own business as a rice wholeseller for the past five years.\r\n\r\nJameela's son needs to buy rice bags in bulk and other commodities to resell, but due to his financial constraints he is unable to purchase these commodities. Therefore Jameela has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will assist her son to buy these commodities to resell to earn a profitable income. The profits will also help him to save to meet the needs of his family and business.\r\n\r\nJameela is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

Garik's wife doesn't work as she has to take care of their children. So as the only breadwinner in the family, Garik does his best to gather a high income. He breeds cattle and sells the meat and milk produced. For tackling financial hardships and enlarging the business, Garik has applied for this loan. The loan will assist him to purchase materials (desks, tools, etc.) for starting yogurt production.

She lives on the way to Quillacollo in an area far from the city center with her mother, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins; they are the help and support in her life.\r\n\r\nLesly is a chemical engineer graduate from the state university. She says that her mother is her role model, being a single mother who could only do short courses on secretarial studies and pastry-making with much effort she managed to get her family ahead. Since Lesly was little she had sporadic jobs in sales and it\u2019s due to those jobs that she can help with the household expenses. She can\u2019t have a stable job related to her profession because of a lack of a specialization. \r\n\r\nThe courses that Lesly wants to take are very costly for her and her family to pay that is why she is requesting a loan for education. She wants to take a Specialist Course in ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Regulations which will complement her current knowledge and therefore fulfil her dream of having a stable job. This will allow her to improve her financial situation at home.\r\n\r\nLesly thanks the people that through their financial resources help others and generate new opportunities for growth, like they are allowing her now.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1521581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Imomali has a medical degree, and for the past 15 years, he has been working as the main physician at a local hospital.  He is now also planning to launch a new business in the field of pharmacy.  He would like to open a pharmacy in his neighborhood, in order to provide access to medication to the local population.  He knows how difficult it is for the local residents to purchase essential medications.  They often have to go into the city, which is very time-consuming.  In order to realize his project, Imomali needs 1,800 USD and he is taking a loan in this amount.  He has already found commercial space for his pharmacy, so he will use his loan amount to buy medicines in bulk from the city and transport them into his shop.

He describes his biggest business challenge to be the lack of funds to buy more stock of carpentry materials. He will use the KES 50,000 loan to buy timber, nails and other materials to make the items he sells. His business goal is to have a bigger carpentry business within five years.

Kakamega County is located in Western Kenya and is famous for its rain forest. Many farmers in the area grow maize, sugar cane and bananas, with maize being the primary crop. The density of the old growth trees in the Kakamega forest, and the variety of crops grown in the area, make this an excellent area for beekeeping.\r\n\r\nMaxwell is married and has eight children. His wife is a teacher. Both he and his wife farm their land. They have been farming for 40 years now and they are currently growing sugarcane, maize, and vegetables and they raise cows and poultry. Maxwell is looking forward to beekeeping because it will provide him with honey for medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is Maxwell\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and he intends to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay University fees for his children.

and a positive man of 39 years.  He is married and has five children.  Together with his family, Jumanazar lives in a small town.  From a very young age, he earned money by helping his father grow crops.  Jumanazar learned a lot about the trade from his father and was able to continue his business and use it to earn for his family.  The climate in the area where he lives is conducive to growing crop, and he is able to earn a nice income.  His many kids, however, also require necessities which cost money.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Jumanazar has a small plot of land which he uses to grow crops.  Recently he collected a large harvest and now, wishes to sow for the next season.  However, he spent all of the money on providing his family with necessities. Jumanazar turned to Arvand for help.

He is married and has four children.  Together with his family he lives in a small town in the countryside.  Furkat's father made a living by growing crops.  From a very young age, Furkat loved the outdoors and loved working in the field helping his father grow onions, wheat, corn, tomatoes and other vegetables.  Owing to his lack of a university education, Furkat decided to go in his father's footsteps and start growing crops himself, to be able to provide for his family.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Furkat has a small plot of land near his house, where he grows vegetables.  Furkat also has a few heads of cattle which he raises and sells.  In addition, he makes supplementary income as a builder.  Sometimes, he works on building houses as an assistant to the foreman.  Fukrat is spending all of the money that he makes on providing for his family and financially helping his parents.  Today, Fukrat needs to buy seed for the next sowing, but he does not have enough money.  To get help, Fukrat turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase seed.  He thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1515750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-02-15T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-17T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Furkat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1972},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2028}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":419.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":419.05,"local_amount":1972,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2011.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694792},{"amount":430.95,"local_amount":2028,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2068.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626588}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T15:55:40Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victor Khangulov","image":1437106}},{"id":669383,"name":"Munir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Munir is 40 years old.

However, this has never stopped her, and she has always believed she could stand out from the rest. She realises that her way of achieving this is by studying. <br \/><br \/>She has always dreamt of going to university, but this is not currently possible. At some point, she became demoralised because she saw it was going to be really difficult to access higher education.  However, she always believed that an opportunity would present itself. One day, Viviana was visited by a friend who told her about a place called CampoAlto, where she could study and which offered a lot of health programs. Viviana has always liked to help and support people with various needs and problems, and she knows that a special way of doing that is via healthcare. When she realised that through her friend 's help she had managed to get to CampoAlto, she became quite emotional, and since that moment she has been studying at this institute.<br \/><br \/>Viviana decided to study a course called pharmaceutical services and is now very happy studying as she knows she will be able to secure a job and that with that work she will achieve the thing she always dreamt of: studying at university. She does not easily give up, although at times she does lose hope because she can't pay her fees on time or because she doesn't have the money for transport or for an exercise book. This is why she needs a Kiva loan, so she can achieve her dreams. She isn't a person to miss an opportunity, but rather she takes advantage of one to the utmost. She will never forget where she came from and everything she had to do to achieve her dream. She will be forever grateful for everything God has given her and to those who have helped her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1529540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester's tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-15T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-17T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Heimy Viviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":152062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069842},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":152062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882790},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":152062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202154},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286295},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":152062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225002}],"funded_date":"2014-02-15T14:42:04Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon Rees","image":null}},{"id":669541,"name":"Adrian Ramon","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Adrian habitante del municipio de Ticuantepe, soltero padre de dos hijos, el habita en casa de su mama, trabaja para una empresa privada desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, el tiene deseos de superacion y mejorar sus condiciones de vida, el credito lo esta solicitando para la compra de materiales como, cemento, bloques, hierro ya que ralizara modificaciones en la parte tracera de la vivienda, Agradece la confianza y apoyo que recibe de Kiva y Afodenic con este prestamo.","en":"Se\u00f1or Adrian lives in the town of Ticuantepe, sand is a single father to two children.

conditions and stimulate her family's economic situation.  She is married and raising five children.  Her husband earns a small salary.  This salary is not enough to provide the family with all of the necessities.  Guliston decided to help her husband for the welfare of the family.  With this goal in mind, she completed the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained a certificate.  Now she is quite capable of starting her own business and becoming successful in this field.  She wants to organize a business of reselling fruits because fruits have a lot demand on the local market.

He has to feed the calves for one or two years until they have grown up and are healthy, which is a very lengthy and expensive procedure. \r\n\r\nA few days ago, two of his healthy buffaloes suddenly died due to fetal disease; he has been producing milk and breeding from these buffaloes.

Razzaq wants to buy a buffalo to keep constant his income and business but he has already invested his all savings into miscellaneous expenses of the dairy farm. He does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy a buffalo to continue business smoothly. Therefore, M. Razzaq has requested a Kiva loan through Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nOur field partner met with him and let him know about all the terms & conditions of Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan. He has agreed with our repayment schedule and signed happily all the necessary documents, including client waiver. \r\n\r\nThe fetal diseases are the major challenges for him. He hopes that he will pay all the installments on due time. With the profit amount he will buy fodder for cattle and cures against diseases. M.

Three years ago, she started up her business in selling ice cream after her husband became disabled to cover the household expenses. She had no choice but to work and provide her family with food and clothing. Despite her strong determination, she managed to succeed in the first business of her entire life. \r\n\r\nRecently, Seham wants to start selling sweets in new quarters and places in her city, and this is why she applied for a loan of 40,000 YER to buy sweets for resale.

Having more items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and education expenses for her child. \r\n\r\nShe looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. She dreams of being more successful in business and hopes to have a better standard of living. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance

44, is a resident of Cabrera, Pasay, Philippines.

In the Philippines, the working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all family members can consume the meal. This is both a family tradition and a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons. Instead, people buy cooked rice and prepared food which costs less than making your own. She earns additional income by operating a variety store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business, she requests 20, 000 PHP to buy more quantities of meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nJean dreams of being successful in business and hopes that her child will finish his studies. She meets weekly with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work.  She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Akylay is 27 years old, not married, and lives with her parents. Akylay has higher education. She works in the department of physical education and sports in her region. As an additional income for her family, Akylay works with livestock breeding, after having started 4 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Akylay's persistent work and the help of her parents, her farm currently has 5 dairy cows, 2 mares and 10 sheep. The monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Akylay turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan to purchase calves to increase the number of livestock. Akylay plans to invest the income from the loan in increasing the number of livestock, and plans to save money to purchase a new house.

After the death of her husband, Anipa for a long time thought she would not be able to survive the loss of her loved one. She had to raise and support her children, and Anipa decided to take on the financial and household responsibility by herself. Anipa has secondary education.\r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Anipa works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 14 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 7,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Anipa's persistent work, her farm currently has four dairy cows and 10 sheep. She also has a plot of land of 1.56 hectares, on which she grows barley, wheat and hay. She has all conditions for breeding cattle, having harvested 200 pieces of pressed hay and 1.5 tons of barley. The monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Anipa turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan to purchase cows to fatten and subsequently resell at the market at a higher price. Anipa plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock, and intends to save money for repairing her

Odinagul loves her family very much and strives to do everything for their benefit. \r\n\r\nWhile her husband and son work at the school, teaching the children, Odinagul works at home with livestock breeding. She learnt to take care of cattle before she was married, at her parents house. And not long ago, Odinagul decided to use her skills for business. Currently she has two heads of cattle and Odinagul would like to work properly with her business in order to bring significant income to her family budget. However she does not have enough money to purchase cattle. For this reason she applied for a loan.

She is married to Catalino, a farmer. They have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. They both work hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nEmiliana operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a typical family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend money on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also has a farm for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her maintain operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, as well as frozen food products. \r\n\r\nEmiliana hopes that her business will be stable and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

She did not have the opportunity to study, since her parents came from humble backgrounds and could not   \r\ngive her the chance to study. Her family was also very large and there were not sufficient funds to send everyone to school.  She had to work and help her family with the home expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe has four children who are all older with their own families. However, she feels that children always look to their parents for help.  Her husband makes a living in agriculture.  In the last few months, he has had health problems and so Concepci\u00f3n has taken over his work tasks and taking care of the animals.\r\n\r\nShe dedicates herself to raising cattle and to agriculture.  She has done this type of work since her children were very small, together with her husband; he is an expert in livestock and agriculture.  It is a tough job, but they are able to earn a little bit more money.  They do not have other sources of income.\r\n\r\nShe is going to leave the animals with a caretaker since she has to handle all the agricultural tasks now that her husband is no longer able to help her.  This is more difficult and more expensive for her because she has to pay fees for the caregiver.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n needs this loan in order to purchase three goats, manure, and fertilizers.  This will allow her to have more animals, which will increase levels of milk production.  She will also be able to have a more abundant harvest, which will permit her to have what she needs in her home.\r\n\r\nHer future dreams are to expand her house and to have a larger number of animals and therefore increase profits.  She has always been a woman who has learned to live with the bare essentials.

Often, the items are all a single price in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and then selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.<br \/><br \/>She is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.<br \/><br \/>Mercidita hopes that her business will last longer and she dreams of having their own house.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week.  This is also where she can draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

His wife is currently undertaking training in becoming a kindergarten teacher. Their elder child goes to elementary school, while the younger one stays at kindergarten. \r\n\r\nLast year, he bought an electric car from his friend, and the due date is near, but he does not have enough cash for repayment. So, he is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to pay the remaining fee of his electric car. The advantage of the electric car is that it wastes less fuel and emits harmless pollutants. Currently, this car is his family's main income generator.

","en":"Firuza is a hard-working and responsible woman. She was married, but recently divorced her husband. She now lives alone in a small village with her two children. She loves her children very much and tries to give them everything they need to grow up, mature and realize their potential in society. This is why Firuza works for a steady income.\r\n\r\nFiruza raises livestock for a living. She started a business a few years ago and is currently trying to expand. She buys cattle to raise and then sells milk and meat. She has a small field near her house for grazing the cattle, which makes it a very convenient business for her.

She raised 5 children, all of whom are married and live in their own homes with their own families.  Zina's youngest son lives with her and helps her with her business.  Zina has a secondary level education and the main source of her family's income is from the animal husbandry business she started 14 years ago with the purchase of 25,000 som (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of Zina's hard work, today she has 6 milking cows, 30 sheep, and 5 goats.   Her cattle farm is developing along a stable path.

The two eldest are university students and the rest are still in school.  Juldus's husband is a farmer with a great deal of experience.  Juldus has a secondary level education.  Her family's main source of income is the animal husbandry business she started 20 years ago with the purchase of 5,000 som (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Juldus has one milk cow and 39 sheep.  She has everything necessary for raising cattle.  She has feed and hay at the ready.  Juldus also has a large, 1 HA plot of land where every year she grows beans, peppers, and potatoes.  She sells some of the vegetables and uses the rest at home.  Her monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Juldus applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy steers in order to increase the size of her herd.

However, since he was 6 years old he has worked in the purchase of animals to breed and butcher. He also sows 1 hectare of corn and one of beans. His work is 10 meters from his home.\r\n\r\nOscar is requesting this loan because he needs to purchase livestock and breed it since it seems that it is a line of work that generates a very good income for him and allows him to bring his family out ahead.\r\n\r\nHis dream is for his business to function in the best way and provide him earnings to pay the loan, and with the profits save up to purchase more animals to be able to begin a ranch.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1528799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-15T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-17T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Arnoldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768429}],"funded_date":"2014-03-10T14:13:03Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":669867,"name":"Saro's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aged 41 years, Saro is widowed and she lives with her family in a rural area, located in the Memot district of Kampong Cham province.

Nurzada has a specialized secondary level education and she works as a nurse in a rehabilitation center.  Nurzada is very responsible, sociable, and cheerful.  Additionally, Nurzada and her husband are in the business of animal husbandry and farming.  They started their business 25 years ago with the purchase of 5,000 som (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of Nurzada's hard work, today she has one milking cow, a foal, and 8 sheep.  Her monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk.  She also works 2.5 HA of land where primarily she grows beans and potatoes.  They sell their harvests to wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing the business, Nurzada applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy cows in order to increase the size of her herd.  After their purchase, the cows will be kept at the farm.  During the summer, they will be out with a shepherd.

The oldest daughter and son are college students, and the third son is a school student.  Chynara has a secondary-specialized education.  She works as a nurse at a school, and her husband is involved in wholesale sales of coal starting from autumn until the end of winter.  To provide an additional income for her family, Chynara is involved in farming and animal husbandry, having started 19 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 2 bulls, 6 sheep, and also a 1.28 hectare land plot, where she annually grows beans for sale. The aggregate monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Chynara requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy high-quality bean seeds for sowing work and fertilizers for treating soil.

Djamila has a secondary education.  She is very responsible, personable and happy.  Her husband works as a shepherd-for-hire and has a set income.  Djamila is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 3 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 50,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).  She also works on 1.14 hectares of land, where she primarily grows beans.  They sell the resulting harvest to wholesale distributors.  In order to further develop her business, Djamila requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a horse in order to increase livestock headcount.  Having bought a horse, they would be able to simplify and speed up the process of treating the land plot.
