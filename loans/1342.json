She is 32 years old.  Dilafriz is divorced and has two sons.  The divorce did not break her, and she found strengths in herself to move forward for her children.  Dilafriz and her children live with her sister.  She leased a space at the central market of the district.  She is involved in leasing wedding dresses.  Dilafriz likes what she does because this business brings in an income and because she likes to help young women choose dresses.  Dilafriz is a happy and responsive woman; she tries to make sure that every young woman finds her dress.  At the present time, Dilafriz is having financial difficulties and requested this loan to bring in more dresses.  She would not be able to accomplish her goal without the loan.  Dilafriz hopes that she will be helped and that her business significantly

Her reason for requesting this loan is that Paulina needs to buy diesel fuel to operate her machinery, since she has a contract with the autonomous government of an town for the construction of a highway, and the work has not been paid for in advance. Paulina confronts challenges in her business; for instance, she has to travel constantly to the town, which is risky because the road is in poor condition, and it is dangerous especially when it rains.

The area is characterized by people who work hard everyday to raise their families and keep their culture and traditions alive. \r\nOne of the members of this group is Ligia. She is getting her second loan alongside her friends in the Ga\u00f1aloma group.

At the same time, the loans help improve her financial stability.\r\nLigia is 19 years old. She is married and the fruit of their union is their 2 year old son. Her husband works in construction. They do not have their own home, they are renting.\r\nLigia has worked in the city as a maid for the past year but in her homeland she has raised guinea pigs and hens. Her mother cares for them and during the weekend Ligia travels home. She also cultivates and harvests crops for household consumption and for sale. The money from her loan will be invested in buying guinea pigs and hens of better quality. Her goal is to have a store and, therefore, have her own business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3800,"image":{"id":1529697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to invest in guinea pigs and hens.

She made sure her daughter was taken care of and went to study at night because she wanted to make sure her daughter had a better quality of life. She knew studying would bring a better job and better economic stability. \r\nMaria was sure that was her first step to fulfill the dream to start a small or large company. She chose to study financial accounting because this career would help her in the company where she is working. She began to study at an institution of higher learning called Las Mercedes. The day she was doing the enrollment process, she was told that she could obtain the benefit of a Kiva loan. It was news that made her so glad because it is a big help for her as a single mother and household head. It was difficult to pay the fees and with this loan she can be prepared. She was the right person because she got a promotion at the company where she worked. Finally the day came that she longed for: she has her own company distributing and selling paintings.

Her income from the business is assisting their everyday household expenditures. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their family.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for another 40,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSusan hopes that her business will continue to expand and dreams to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

There was no financial support available for low-income families.  With a great deal of effort and dedication, she was able to complete the 11th grade on a weekday evening in 2005.  <br \/><br \/>Later on, it was suggested that she continue her studies by entering the pharmacy assistant program.  This program focuses on the prevention and resolution of drug-related problems so that the well-being and quality of life of the patient can improve.  Afterwards, Olga decided to move to Bogota in search of other ways to improve academically.  She researched and inquired about higher education institutions and corporations that offered payment options, flexible hours, and of course, the field of study that she wanted to pursue. Olga concluded that CampoAlto was an institution with quality standards and a good foundation for building her future.  She is now enrolled and part of the student body at CampoAlto.  Olga hopes to finish her degree program and be able to work competently in her field of study.  <br \/><br \/>The Kiva loan will be a great help to her since she is bearing the cost of her studies by herself.

She is 37 years old and a mother of five children; two of them are in school. To support her family, she grows rice on two hectares of farmland and works for others for a fee.

She buys animals (baby goats & calves) at low prices, raises them and then sells them near the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha (a religious event in Muslims countries).

However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife, Nargis has requested a loan amount from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price.

Now, she is teaming up in a group of two to receive a new loan of 500,000 KHR for herself and 1,000,000 KHR for her co-borrower.

Roger intends to use his loan to buy calves for his farm and to use the pastures on his land. He also wants to take advantage of the low price of calves as in summer there are a lot of calves available on the market. Roger's plan is to use the good land and climate  to his advantage in order to have these animals growing up to later sell them for their meat.

Vestine has been in her business for the past four years. With the loan, she would like to buy fertilizers and support labor costs during rice production. The profits from the business will be used to reinvest in her farming. All the group members practice the same rice farming in the same area. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

an\u00f3nimos, un lugar donde ayudan a las personas que tienen problemas con el alcohol, fue as\u00ed como este hombre dejo de consumir bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas.\nEl padre siempre fue muy responsable y quiso quitarle la custodia de Mayerli a la madre, despu\u00e9s de varios procesos legales a Mayerli la pusieron a decidir con cual de los dos se quer\u00eda quedar, Mayerli  decidi\u00f3 quedarse con el padre quien le dio la educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica primaria, despu\u00e9s de un tiempo Mayerli  decidi\u00f3 irse con la madre, ya que en la casa donde viv\u00eda con los t\u00edos, abuela, primos, no le brindaban la suficiente atenci\u00f3n que ella necesitaba  y quer\u00eda, muchas veces recibiendo la poca alimentaci\u00f3n que quer\u00edan darle.\nYa tomada la decisi\u00f3n culmino los estudios de bachillerato al lado de la madre, la cual trabajaba como vendedora de rosas en discotecas los fines de semana; mientras ella hacia esta labor Mayerli se encargaba de trabajar  vendiendo cigarrillos, dulces, minutos, La joven despu\u00e9s de terminar decidi\u00f3 iniciar una carrera contando siempre con la ayuda del padre, pero todo se vio afectado cuando el padre en un mismo a\u00f1o tuvo tres accidentes, el ultimo dej\u00e1ndolo incapacitado de la rodilla izquierda sin poder seguir ayudando a la hija y haciendo tr\u00e1mites para lograr la pensi\u00f3n, pero fue un tiempo extremadamente largo, tiempo en el cual no daba espera el estudio de Mayerli quien tuvo que retirase falt\u00e1ndo dos semestres. \nMayerli y la madre continuaron trabajando fuertemente para

","en":"Mayerli is a young woman who grew up in a normal life, but unfortunately she didn't have her father by her side. Her mother left him because of problems. They had a lot of problems in the home, but days later he decided to seek help with Alcoholics Anonymous, a place that helps people with alcohol problems. That is how he stopped drinking.  \r\n\r\nHer father was very responsible and wanted to have custody of Mayerli instead of her mother. After several legal proceedings it was left up to Mayerli to decide which parent she wanted to live with. Mayerli decided to stay with her father and he provided her with a primary education. After a time, Mayerli  decided to go live with her mother, since in the house where she lived there were also aunts and uncles, her grandmother and cousins living there and she didn't get the attention she needed and wanted. Often, she would get what little food they wanted to give her. \r\n\r\nOnce she decided, she finished high school at her mother's side. Her mother worked selling roses in dance clubs on weekends. While she did this, Mayerli would sell cigarettes, candies, and phone cards. After finishing school she decided to start a major with her father's help. However, everything was affected when her father had three accidents that same year. The last one left him disabled in his left knee, unable to help his daughter, and in the process of being able to pay tuition. However, it took an extremely long time and Mayerli's studies wouldn't wait, and she had to withdraw after two semesters. \r\n \r\nMayerli and her mother continued working hard to get the money she needed to continue studying her major, but fate again played a dirty trick on them. Mayerli was working at a bread bakery when she got a call from a friend who told her her mother had been robbed of everything. What's worse is that they robbed the house and left them with nothing. They stole their appliances and money that her mother had saved with so much hard work.\r\n\r\nThey picked themselves up again and went on with their lives, working to try and recover their things little by little. Mayerli thought the possibility that she could finish her major was gone. She started to work in a clothing store. Since Mayerli has always been a woman who liked to learn she took advantage of free courses offered in first aid and occupational health. These courses got her interested in the area of health. On one occasion she was working and she received a flyer from Campo Alto, where they offered several areas of study, among them pharmacology. She became interested and she called. They gave her information related to the program.

Quiche, the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Misioneras,\u201d meaning \u201cThe Missionaries,\u201d was formed. The group consists of eight women who are on average, 43 years old. The women share a common goal to improve the standard of living for their families and create a better future for their children. They work in various commercial ventures including the sale of clothing, manufacturing and sale of textiles, as well as selling foods like fruit and tortillas.\r\n\r\nEach Friendship Bridge Trust Bank has officers and a board of directors. The current President of Las Misioneras is 44-year-old Candelaria who is married with four children. She is most dedicated to her children and their success. Two of them have graduated from high school and another child will graduate this year. Her last child is in the 7th grade. Candelaria, along with the women in her Trust Bank, realize that education is a vital key to a successful future for the children.\r\n\r\nCandelaria has been a member of the Trust Bank since the beginning. Her previous loans have positively impacted her bakery business. Recently she began to sell \u201crefacciones,\u201d which are snacks. Candelaria is requesting a new loan and will use the funds to purchase a refrigerator and additional items for food preparation. She sells her snacks during the week at a school in her community, beginning at 9:00 in the morning. When school is not in session and the children are on vacation, Candelaria makes banana bread to sell in the community.\r\n\r\nAlong with the fellow members of her Trust Bank, Candelaria is most grateful for the funds generously donated by KIVA lenders and administered by Friendship Bridge. The women are able to maintain and increase their businesses. They also benefit from the monthly trainings on subjects like business administration and indebtedness, nutrition and health, as well as self-esteem. The combination of the loans and education is a winning one for these women who are able to step into a more empowered future, benefiting themselves, their families and their community of Santa Cruz del Quiche."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5100,"image":{"id":1530349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

\r\n\r\nCelestina is a young 26-year-old single woman who is a member of the Trust Bank. She learned to weave and embroider when she was a child. Approximately one year ago, she decided to open her own small store where she sells aprons, called \u201cdelantales,\u201d that she and one of her sisters make. The aprons are quite popular in her town and can be very elaborate, filled with beautiful embroidery and trim. Celestina also sells baby clothing, gifts, toys and many other things. She feels committed to supporting her family and providing income. She has eight siblings. This hardworking, young woman is requesting a new loan to purchase colorful fabrics to make additional aprons. She also wants to stock additional baby clothing. Finally, Celestina is thinking of selling the traditional skirts used by the indigenous women in Guatemala called \u201ccortes.\u201d They come in many colors and sizes.\r\n\r\nCelestina is most grateful for the financial support provided by KIVA lenders as this not only gives her working capital but also other opportunities as well. Friendship Bridge offers monthly trainings for Celestina and her friends in the Trust Bank with their Microcredit Plus Program, a most useful combination of financial capital and education. In this way, Celestina and her fellow Trust Bank members face a brighter future for themselves, their families and their community.

She shares that her group is very responsible, punctual and supportive. She adds that during the five years that she has been involved in the Friendship Bridge Microcredit Program, her business has grown. Her production and sales have increased as well. Friendship Bridge provides useful monthly trainings to clients and Julia and her fellow Trust Bank members have learned a lot about topics like hygiene and health, natural medicines, empowerment, self-esteem, children and women\u2019s rights. This component of the Friendship Bridge Microcredit Plus Program contributes greatly to their personal growth. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of \u201cLas Rosas de Chipuac\u201d Trust Bank, Julia thanks KIVA lenders who believe in their efforts and work, and fund their loans.

He started studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree but was not able to continue his university studies due to a lack of resources. This has not meant a limit for him and he decided to learn a trade where he could feel valuable.  He is married and his wife has a small coffee stand.  His son is five years old and attends kindergarten.\r\n\r\nHe has been a mason for seven years but this is temporary whenever a construction opportunity arises.

Catarina comments that she enjoys this work, because it is honest work that gives her a way to serve her community.  She has more than 17 years of experience in this line of work.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of contributing to her community, Catarina decided to organize a communal bank where she and her fellow group members could help each other and thereby improve their living standards.

She decided to begin with an accelerated study program for her high school diploma on Sundays, as her husband helps her with the household work. The accelerated program took her three years to complete and it involved a lot of sacrifices and difficulties, but she graduated December 9 with all of her family feeling very proud of her. Nancy would very much like to continue studying. She works part-time, but she and her husband use all of their combined income to pay their household expenses. For this reason, this Kiva loan would be a great financial help for her.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2013 she learned that she could continue studying by financing her tuition for the semester. She decided to study Cosmetology and Holistic Esthetics. This program has been a dream of hers, because she is very interested in the care of the body. She is thinking of having her own business, so that she could support her children in their studies, but she is also thinking of buying a home. She has come through a period of so much financial difficulty that she has not been able to buy one.

El dinero que est\u00e1 solicitando es para comprar los materiales que necesita como lo son tela, cuellos pique blanco tela de delantales y cotonas para ni\u00f1os, franela, botones, ya que ella se dedica a vender ropa de colegio, y es por esto, ya que en Chile, los ni\u00f1os entran en el mes de marzo al colegio, que ella necesita aun m\u00e1s el dinero.

The associates of this communal bank have diverse businesses like, book stores, new and used clothing sales, hair salons. Patricia runs a sewing business that she started 16 years ago, after studying cutting and confection in college. Patricia was able to buy some sewing machines with the help of her husband, but at this time, they've decided to save up in order to buy a house. This is the reason why Patricia lacks funds right now. She is requesting a loan to buy the materials she needs, like fabric, collars, white piqu\u00e9 for aprons, cotton for children, flannel and buttons as she sells clothing for school, and in Chile, the children go to school in March and that's when she needs the most money. She knows it will go very well for her.

He is married and he and his wife have three children: a six-year-old son, and twin girls who are just four month sold. Juan's wife works in their home, but also has a job in a nearby shop that makes fresh cheese. Working close to home allows Juan's wife to earn money while still caring for her family. \r\n\r\nJuan is a farmer and has worked the land from a very young age. When Juan was a child, his father brought him to the fields to teach him to farm. Juan has also worked as a bus driver in his town, but that job doesn't pay enough to meet his needs. Juan therefore also digs wells, and people hire him to dig wells that are up to 13 meters deep.   \r\n\r\nJuan is a hardworking man and needs a loan to invest in land and in the production of his two most important crops, corn and squash. He also wants to invest part of the loan funds in the purchase of pigs to raise in the courtyard next to his home. These animals would become a future source of income. \r\n\r\nJuan hopes to keep moving forward and purchase his own car so that he can take his crops to sell in different places. Selling crops this way would be a great help and allow Juan to earn a higher income and provide a better quality of life for his family.

Specifically, she is a seamstress making ladies clothes.\r\n\r\nTo date, she has earned good profits and now she wants to expand her business to earn more money. As a result, she applied for a loan of 20,000 YER to buy fabrics and sewing materials to use in her business. She is very ambitious and loves her family very much.

Her mother works for a company as a filing assistant and Katerin works doing microfilming for a private company.  Katerin does piecework so everything depends on what she does.\r\n\r\nKaterin's mother supports her and her two brothers, but it's difficult to support the three of them.  Katerin helps by contributing 150,000 pesos [COP] a month when she can, because sometimes she only has enough to pay her monthly school expenses and transportation.  This is why it's difficult for her mother to pay for a lot of Katerin's things, because she has to pay the school expenses of Katerin's brothers, the services where they live, and their own transportation.\r\n\r\nThis is why Katerin needs help from Kiva, because often what she earns isn't enough to make her monthly payment to Campo Alto.  She does what she can to make her payment because she already postponed her dream of studying for a year.\r\n\r\nKaterin enjoys nursing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1530593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay her tuition for a semester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-17T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-19T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katerin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":152361.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882809},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152361.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202173},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":152361.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286314},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":152361.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225021}],"funded_date":"2014-02-17T08:04:22Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":670359,"name":"Concepci\u00f3n Del Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora se re\u00fane en La parroquia La Sequita en Montecristi prospero cant\u00f3n manabita, conocido como la cuna  del viejo luchador Eloy Alfaro.

Her husband has been running a general store in which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap, biscuits, etc. He manages his household necessities from his own store as well; some relatives like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with a monotonous tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relationships with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town; that is the reason his business is running well. \r\n\r\nDue to good relationships, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Yasmeen requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits, etc. Yasmeen thanks Kiva and its field partner

However, due to lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the costs of repairs. For this reason, Shahida has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan in order to help her husband to pay for his rickshaw to be repaired.

The group is made up of nine members and is run by a board of directors headed by Juana, the President. The businesses of the members of this communal association are varied, including selling clothing, knitting sweaters, selling cosmetic products, running a neighborhood store, selling groceries, selling backpacks, and selling electronic items.\r\n\r\nThe loan they will take out will benefit small microentrepreneurs, including Juana.

Nevertheless, his desire to be able to improve himself has lead him to launch his own business.  He is single.  He lives and works with his parents.  Jonathan is very hardworking and is always very responsible in all his doings.  He lives in a town that is considered to be one of Mexico\u2019s \u201cPueblos M\u00e1gicos,\u201d or Magical Towns.  These are picturesque places, full of history and tradition. \r\n\r\nJonathan is continuing with his business making clothing.  This time he is asking for a new loan to buy thread, inks, mesh, and squeegees to make his silk-screened items.  He says that he really likes putting these finishing touches on uniforms.  To do the silkscreen, Jonathan needs to have a lot of imagination and creativity.  In this way his customers are left very happy with the printing on their sports uniforms.  Jonathan doesn\u2019t have any problems with his business; he\u2019s just lacking the funds to reinvest, but with this new loan he will have materials to deliver the orders he has received on time.  Most likely in March he will need a new loan to print more uniforms.  \r\n\r\nHe began this work because his parents began sewing 30 years ago.  Jonathan learned very quickly, thanks to his mother\u2019s teaching, although his father is also an active part of the business, as well.  The loan will help him to invest more, because the classes in the schools are about to start next month and he already has various important orders.  Jonathan says, \u201cOur only difficulty at this point is a lack of money to get the materials.  We need large amounts of money to be able to complete all our deliveries.\u201d His uniforms are distributed to other towns, and not just where they live.  \r\n\r\nJonathan\u2019s dream is to make his business grow, to be able to offer his services in other places and to perhaps open another tailoring shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1402647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy thread, inks, mesh, and squeegees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-02-17T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-19T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2472.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2672.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2738.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2895.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3029.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3191.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":185.44,"local_amount":2472.67,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-02T09:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2495.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459247833},{"amount":200.48,"local_amount":2673.06,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2698.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072884},{"amount":205.38,"local_amount":2738.53,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2764.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479290198},{"amount":217.13,"local_amount":2895.21,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2922.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490986602},{"amount":227.22,"local_amount":3029.61,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3058.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504427534},{"amount":239.35,"local_amount":3190.92,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3220.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517705222}],"funded_date":"2014-02-17T16:11:46Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":660164,"name":"Bicentenario Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cPALMERAS\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el s\u00e9ptimo ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Isidora es la Presidenta.

She takes her responsibilities as a mother and homemaker very seriously. She lives with her family in Rawalpindi.\r\n\r\nFarzana's husband has been providing transport facilities by driving a taxi for the past 8 years. As the sole breadwinner for the family, he is responsible for fulfilling the needs of the entire family. At present, his vehicle is in bad condition and requires essential repairs as well as ongoing maintenance. Due to insufficient financial means, he is unable to afford these repairs. Farzana has therefore applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, Farzana's husband will be able to afford the costs of repairs and maintenance. This will allow him to provide improved transport services and earn a profitable income. \r\n\r\nFarzana also plans to build savings with the increased profit from her husband's business to meet her family's needs in the future.\r\n  \r\nFarzana is very grateful to her Kiva lenders and to BRAC

She has a 3-year-old daughter and is married.  Her husband makes a living working in agriculture.  At this point in the season, he is harvesting coffee on the farm.  They are a very unified and hardworking family.  While he is at work, she dedicates herself to the household chores, taking care of her daughter, and tending their small store.\r\n\r\nLeydi is the one who directly tends the store.  In search of extra money for the family, she decided to open this small business where she is able to generate good income.  In the area where she lives, she is unable to have the store in her house.  Therefore, she has to walk about fifteen minutes to the store every day while also caring for her daughter.  She does this until her husband arrives to help her.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy more merchandise to stock her store.  She currently does not have many products to offer.  In having more merchandise, she will increase her daily income and be able to increase her profits.  By buying her merchandise in bulk, she is able to get a lower price.  She will also save money in transportation costs.  She must go to the city to buy merchandise, however transportation to and from her community is limited.  Therefore, she usually has to pay for a vehicle to move her products from the city to her community store.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants her daughter to grow up and become a good, hardworking member of the community.  She also hopes that her daughter will be able to study at the university level.

She lived in Argentina, where she learned physiotherapy. Next, she pursued the American dream and worked for five years as a physiotherapist. Since then, she has worked for three years in the city, and, because her way of treating her patients is very well-regarded in the community, patients come from other places to be treated by her. Her children include a 19-year-old man who has recently graduated from high school and a nine-year-old in primary school.\r\n\r\nHer experience includes eight years working as a physiotherapist, with three years of experience working as an owner. This type of work has generated Reina a lot of recognition in her communication. She learned in Argentina and, as a medical student, she felt that her job was to help people with massages and treatments. Her clients come to her home for treatments, and she works the whole day. From the moment her clients arrive, she takes care of them, and as a result, she often does not leave her home.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy two machines for massages, since the constant use has damaged the ones she currently has. The machines help her a lot in doing her work. With the loan, she will be able to buy them, and thus, will be able to continue working and continue giving her clients the attention that they deserve. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants to buy land and build the home that she has already dreamed of in a place with a cool climate near the coast, which is different from the warm climate in the place where she is from. She wants her children to study at a college so that her son can become a civil engineer and so that her daughter can become a doctor. Her dreams are that her children have a long and successful career, and she has faith in God that he will help her go forward."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1517742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy two machines for massages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-17T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-19T15:50:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":91.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":99.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.84,"local_amount":71.84,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":71.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088607},{"amount":88.2,"local_amount":88.2,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":88.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902872},{"amount":76.12,"local_amount":76.12,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":76.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216060},{"amount":80.51,"local_amount":80.51,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":80.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817419},{"amount":78.21,"local_amount":78.21,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":78.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242868},{"amount":605.12,"local_amount":605.12,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":605.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525954}],"funded_date":"2014-02-21T10:54:20Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":670762,"name":"Shehnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shehnaz is a 51-year-old woman.

She studied through the eighth grade and is a single mother of two children.  Her kids still live at home with her and are both in school.\r\n\r\nShe works as a domestic employee in a private home where she is paid for her services.  She has been involved in this work for nine years, and it has allowed her to move her kids ahead.  In addition to this work, she also has a small business selling tortillas on the weekends.  This generates extra money.  Before doing this, she was a farmer on a small farm.  This was extremely hard work and the income was not enough to maintain her family.  She therefore decided to set up a tortillas stall in the nearest city center.  One of her sisters helps her with this work.  She works about seven hours a day.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting will be used to buy corn so that she can continue selling tortillas.  The loan will help her buy the raw materials she needs to make her tortillas.  This will help to improve the family's income.  Her children's overall quality of life will also be better through improved diet and nutrition.  The loan will allow her to have what she needs at her business to continue working.\r\n\r\nAna has many dreams that she would like to achieve.  She says that with determination and hard work, she will be able to make her dreams come true, which include starting a business selling basic needs products and constructing a house made of better material; she currently lives in a house made of clay and mud.
