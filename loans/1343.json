Entonces se vino para el cant\u00f3n y vio la necesidad de poner una iglesia de construir una champa y reunir personas y hablarle de las cosas de Dios y es ah\u00ed donde la administraci\u00f3n de la iglesia deciden darle una ofrenda pero que es decisi\u00f3n de los que administran la iglesia, ya que tambi\u00e9n es motorista de un bus que hace un recorrido del Municipio a la ciudad y esa es una fuente de ingresos que tiene para la familia este negocio de manejar el bus le queda a una distancia de 20 minutos y viaja a pie y lo hace de un horario de las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana a las 5 de la tarde que hace el \u00faltimo viaje esto lo hace 4 d\u00edas de la semana.\n\nDon Carlos con el pr\u00e9stamo solicitado,  comprara un poste para el tendido el\u00e9ctrico y pagara la bajada de la luz electr\u00f3nica a al templo,  ya que solo tienen las instalaciones y los cables para la iglesia esto mejorara el templo porque la energ\u00eda se las presta una vecina y cuando invitan a grupos de alabanzas y traen demasiados aparatos esa energ\u00eda no la levanta por lo d\u00e9bil que es, pero ya poniendo la energ\u00eda directo ser\u00e1 mejor ya podr\u00e1n llegar  mas grupos y as\u00ed poder gozarse en las cosas de Dios y los j\u00f3venes y todas las personas que vengan , ya que las cosas de Dios son muy buenas mas hoy en d\u00eda como est\u00e1 la situaci\u00f3n, es para que los j\u00f3venes vengan y los padres puedan enviar los hijos. \n\nLos sue\u00f1os para el futuro es poder tener una iglesia muy grande,  con paredes de ladrillo ya que por el momento son  de l\u00e1minas pero tiene fe que en un tiempo lo realizara  y que as\u00ed sus hijos puedan crecer en los caminos de Dios, ya que otro camino como ese no hay.\n\n","en":"Carlos is 47 years old. He finished sixth grade. His wife is dedicated to domestic work. He has six children and five of them are in school.\r\n\r\nCarlos is an evangelical pastor in a church in the area where he lives. He has been dedicated to this for four years. Before he was in the quarter and there a friend sold him a Bible  which he read every night and felt called by God and decided that wherever he walked he would talk to people about the word of God. Then he came to the area and saw the need to start a church in a hut and gather people and talk about Godly things and there the church administration decided to give him a gift but it is up to those who run the church since he is also a bus driver who does a route in the city and is the source of income for his family. This business driving a bus is 20 minutes away and he travels on foot and works from 5AM until 5PM when the last trip is and he does this four days per week.\r\n\r\nWith the loan requested, Carlos will be a pole for wiring and pay for the electric light installation to the temple since they have only the facilities and cables for the church. This will improve the temple because they borrow electricity from a neighbor and when they invite praise groups who bring too many devices, the electricity doesn't come on due to weakness. But installing direct electricity will be better since they will be able to bring more groups and enjoy the things of God and the young people and all of the people who come since the things of God are very good but today as it stands is for young parents to come and send their children.\r\n\r\nThe dreams for the future are to be able to have a large church with brick walls since, at the moment, they are made of sheets but he has faith that in time he will accomplish this. Also that his children can grown in the ways of God since there is now way like this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1518128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a pole for wiring and to pay for electricity connection to the temple.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-17T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-19T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Mar\u00edo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768313}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T18:48:35Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":661690,"name":"Perlitas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cPERLITAS\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el sexto ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Los Andes, est\u00e1 compuesta por once  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Antonia es la Secretaria.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cA woman can take care of the family. It takes a man to provide structure, to provide stability.\u201d says Ranithoilu, and she also shares about her grief when she lost her husband two years back. Family structures and stability without the father, who is the head of the family, is deterred and weaker.\r\n\r\nRanithoilu is pictured with her hand raised as she is the featured borrower for Akalu Group. Akalu's literal meaning is united; she and the other four members support each other and stood as one to form the group. The village in which they live is about 30 kms from Imphal town and the village is located about 5 kms away from the national highway.\r\n\r\nLeft with no other means to support her two sons, Ranithoilu brews wine and sells it for a profit. Brewing wine is a traditional practice for the tribe and Ranithoilu learnt her brewing skills from her parents' home. She usually purchase rice, yeast and other requisite materials from the main market and brews wine. She also sells the left-over fermented solid rice for pig food. She utilises everything she produces in generating income. \r\n\r\nMost of the customers come to her house and purchase the wine; sometimes she also serves them on the spot and charges them an extra service charge. Bigger clay pots are required to brew a good quality wine, but she could not afford to get one and produce a bigger quantity. The generated income is mainly used for her kid\u2019s education and other basic needs like food and clothes. With the help of the Kiva loan, she will purchase a bigger pot, rice and yeast and produce more wine. The neighbouring villages will be sufficiently supplied and in return get paid.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of the Kiva loan, she wants to purchase materials and expand her business. Her dream is to provide higher education to her sons and let them be successful. She will work very hard to support her kids and will also repay the loan amount. Grateful and delighted, Ranituilu says, \u201c Thank you so much, Kiva, for the wonderful experience.\u201d She will always remain grateful for helping her expand her brewing business.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in brewing wine.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1531375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase materials like rice, yeast and bigger pots to brew local wine, generate more income and support the family and kids' education.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bishnupur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-02-17T17:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-19T17:50:07Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ranithoilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"G Anaona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ph Adim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maipakpi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Panmei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-02-18T02:43:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":670844,"name":"Jamila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamila is smart woman.

Kaiyrkul has a higher education. For 12 years, she worked as a math teacher at a local school but after the death of her husband, she took up fattening up and reselling cattle. She started this business 15 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Kaiyrkul's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow with a calf, 2 bulls, 2 sheep and 2 goats on her farm. Her monthly income is 17,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Kaiyrkul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan to buy bulls to fatten up for future resale on the market for a high price.

However, thanks to her family\u2019s hard work during recent years, Anna and her family were able to run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover monthly payments.

He finished fourth grade only. His wife is dedicated to selling tamales and bread to help beat their economic situation since they have a daughter who this year will study the second year of her degree in legal sciences at university. Only his wife and daughter live with him.\r\n\r\nFrancisco always performs various jobs and always finds work. However, his strength is planting maize, beans and sorghum. He learned this work from his parents who took him to the countryside when he was young. Gradually, he grew and could do the work on his own. He has 30 years experience of being a farmer. He also has a car with which he does trips when he's asked in order to earn more income that helps his family. Previously he was dedicated to making clay tile, brick and crafts like mortars, hammocks and ties. He stopped doing this due to lack of the basic materials. To get to where he works as a laborer, it takes 15-20 minutes walking on foot. His working day varies in the function he's performing in his fields. Generally, he works from 6AM to 1PM.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy 500 tiles to improve the roof of his house, as well as to buy the rod to support it, and 5 metal sheets to put under the tiles to prevent water seeping through easily. The loan will improve his health and that of his family. He will live more confidently without worrying he'll get wet during the rainy season. The need to have an adequate house to live happily with his family.\r\n\r\nHe intends to expand his house more, building one more room. He is also thinking of building a bathroom so his family can enjoy better health. His other dreams are to help, with all sacrifice, his daughter who is finishing her university career, and that she becomes a professional so that in the future she can have a different life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1518156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

The vehicle that he uses to make his deliveries is a Nissan Frontier that he rents from his mother-in-law.  He needs a loan for two things.  One is to repair an old car that he owns,  so that he will save a lot of money by not renting one.  The other is to buy a larger quantity of eggs that he can store in cases, so that he won't have to go and see his wholesaler friend so often.  Ruendy dreams of being an egg distributor who is known not only in his community but throughout the city.  In this way he can establish himself economically and think about starting a

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nMa. Bella dreams to have additional branches for her food stall and hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Eutemio, a security guard, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their retail business. Elena is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Elena earns money by getting bulk supplies at wholesale prices and then selling them individually. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day. Elena is requesting a PHP8,000 loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nElena dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes to make a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. She can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1531534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is a father of three children ages 11, 10 and 6.  He married his wife about 13 years ago.  His wife does house work and takes care of their children when he is working: farming or butchering pigs.  He studied until fifth grade, but was not able to continue because of the war that broke out in the country about 35 years ago.  He had to walk about one hour to get to school, and during that time it was much too dangerous.  Three of his children attend the elementary school in their community.  His three children, as well as the two other children that live in his house, depend on him.  \r\n\r\nHe has worked since the age of ten.  His parents taught him how to farm, planting corn, beans and sorghum, as they are the most common crops in the region.  Ten years ago, his brother taught him how to butcher pigs, which allows him to earn a little money to help provide better living conditions for his family.  He butchers about six pigs a month.  He buys them in neighboring communities and sells them where he lives; he has customers that always buy his products.  \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan from Credicampo to purchase 500 bricks valued at $450, $400 worth of wood, and the rest to pay the workers that will help him build his home.  It is important for him, because with this, he will have a decent and safe house for his children.  Carmen dreams of providing his kids with the necessities, so that they can study and prepare themselves academically since he did not have the opportunity to do so.  The loan will help him to fulfill one of his life goals of owning his own house that he can share with his family.  In the future, he hopes to expand his butchering business as it is profitable.

She is the mother of two children who attend the local elementary school.  She comes from a family of nine siblings with whom she has worked in agriculture and doing house work.  Her husband works every weekday in the city, and has to sleep there because he gets out of work late.  She takes care of their children while he works building houses in the city.  For the past four years, Mirian has worked selling linen goods (lotions, creams and other products).  She decided to enter this field based on the demand in the community and other areas where she sells her products.  She purchases her products in the city that is about an hour and a half away.  She travels there using public transportation.  From a young age, she worked with her family in agriculture and doing house work, helping her mother to take care of the family.  \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan from Credicampo to purchase more linen goods (lotions, bracelets and clothing) to offer a greater variety of products to her customers.  She will also purchase bricks to lay down on the dirt floor that she currently has in her home.  This will allow her to have a more comfortable and hygienic home for her family, with less risk of contracting a disease in their feet.  She dreams of giving her children the necessary education so that they can grow up to be professionals and gradually build their home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1518444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase more linen goods (lotions, bracelets and clothing) to have a greater variety of products for her customers, and bricks to lay a floor in her house.

Etienne holds an envelope in the photo, as a symbol of identification from other group members.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She is a hard-working woman who only went to school as far as the sixth grade.  She is a single mother who has had to struggle on her own to raise her young children, who are entirely dependent on her.  They are both students, and are in the 4th and 6th grades in the community school.  She has operated a small caf\u00e9 in the school for several years.  She decided to start this activity because she is the only provider for her family.  She previously worked in door-to-door sales, but was later given the opportunity to have the caf\u00e9.  Her life partner abandoned her, leaving her alone with their two young children, so she had to take charge of the household and get ahead.  Ana will use the loan to buy merchandise for the caf\u00e9, with the goal of offering a variety of products so that her customers are satisfied and she has more income for herself and her family.  In the future she would like to expand her business more, in order to earn more income, and meet the needs of her customers and her family.  She would like to be able to give her children a better education, so that they have opportunities in the future that will be useful to them in practical

","en":"Aniypakan is 57 years and married. She and her husband have five children. All her children are married and live separately with their own families. Aniypakan has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family Aniypakan raises livestock, having launched this business 37 years ago by buying livestock for 1,000 KGS. Her husband works as a driver on a monthly salary.  Thanks to Aniypakan's hard work, her farm now includes three dairy cows and 10 sheep. Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS.

His wife supports and helps him in everything and they work together in order to give their 2 children a better education.

That is how he learned this business, but he decided to do this work full time when he became a father and the head of a household. He does this work from his house. They butcher two times per week and the store is a business that opens every day from 6:00am until 7:00pm. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is to buy merchandise for his store so that he can offer a better variety of products and satisfy his customer\u2019s needs.

His wife works in the home, and also raises backyard birds, with which she earns some income to help her husband with the household expenses.  There are only 4 people living in the house: the couple and their two children.  No one else depends on him.  Delvin's business is selling fresh fish, which he catches in a lagoon close to where he lives.  He supports his family with this activity, which he has been doing for 10 years. This is the best source of income in the area where he lives, so he learned how to do all the activities that are necessary for fishing starting when he was 10 years old.  He went out with his friends and his father to fish in the lagoon, and grew up fishing.  This was why when it came time to support his family he decided to devote himself fully to this activity.  Although his main activity has always been fishing, he also grows basic grains, but only for personal consumption.  The lagoon where he catches fish is 2 kilometers from his house, which is quite close.  Only his brother works with him.  He works at this activity 4 days a week, going out at 5 in the afternoon and returning the following afternoon with the fish.  Sometimes he also goes out in the early morning due to certain conditions that make his work difficult.  The money from this loan will be used to buy a net, which is being sold at an acceptable price, and also to improve the ones that he already has.  He would also like to make improvements to the roof of his house to provide better conditions for his family.  One of the main dreams of the client is to grow his fishing business and have better opportunities to sell his products in the national market.

In times past, as long as families worked, it wasn\u2019t important to know how to read or write, and such is her case. Due to her economic situation, she didn\u2019t go to school. Not knowing how to read hasn\u2019t been an obstacle for her in providing for her four children; she has given them all the necessities, within her economic possibilities. She is a single mother who has overcome all sorts of difficulties in order to provide the necessities to her children. It hasn\u2019t been easy for them, due to the lack of support from her partner. He abandoned her several years ago, along with their small children, and left them with no help. In spite of these difficulties, she raised her children to be hardworking people. They all have their own families, and she just has the youngest son with her. He helps her with her work and in providing for the family.\r\n\r\nSince the time she was young, Marta helped her mother with the house work. Her father went out to fish at night. In the morning she sold the fish that her father caught. That is how she became involved in selling fish, so that this business would be of great help to her in the future, when she started her own family. She now does this with her four children. They fish at night and sell the fresh product in the mornings. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting is to buy a small boat and nets for her youngest son. When he gets a boat, they will be able to catch more fish and sell more product.\r\n\r\nShe plans, for the future, to have a well-equipped boat so that she can have more income and meet her basic necessities.

His life partner works in the home, and they have two small children who attend school in the community.  These three people are the ones who are exclusively dependent on him.  Since he was young, Norbert has worked in agriculture.  He grows basic grains and sells them, an activity that he learned from his father, who taught him all the basics of being a good farmer.  He works every day on his land, specifically in the mornings, and in this way he can see and care for his crops to obtain a good harvest.  He also has oxen, which he uses for his crops and also uses to do work for other farmers who do not have them, to plow or to transport their products.  The loan that he is requesting is to buy fertilizer and manure, and to hire workers to help him with his crops so that he will have better production and sell all of his crop at a good price.  He would also like to buy a dairy cow with which he hopes to have more income in the future.  Norberto plans to have better production in the future, and thus to earn more income with which he can provide his family with a better quality of life and his children with a different future.  He will succeed at this with the help of God and through the loan which is a financial support for his business and his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1519219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and manure, to hire workers to help him with his crops, and to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-17T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-19T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norberto Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768335}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T13:02:34Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:20:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":671029,"name":"Shabana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shabana is the age of 26 and lives with her four children and husband in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

However, thanks to his hard work during recent years, Artur and his family were able to run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international, which provides a second-chance loan to people who have a bad credit history

Although the income is very low, still Laxmi has a habit of putting aside savings with a vision for the marriage of her daughters in a respectable family. \r\n\r\nAfter learning the business procedure and other knowledge, Laxmi wants to increase the volume of her business. Now she wants a loan to purchase curley flower, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, cucumbers, pumpkins, green nuts, brinjal, drum sticks, etc. For better sales she also goes to weekly markets of nearby villages to sell her vegetables. In future she wants to establish a wholesale grocery shop in her village.  \r\n\r\nThe other three members of her group are Janhabi, Nilendri, Karuna.

He lives with his family, which is made up of his wife and children. His wife helps her husband with the butchering, and on other days does domestic work in their home. They are the parents of four children, who are studying in school.\r\n\r\nHe has six years of experience in butchering. He states that he learned it from his grandparents, since they made a living in the same profession since they were young. He decided to continue with said business, motivated by its economic results and the help that it allows him to offer his wife and children, since this has become the principal income source in their home. He also earns a living in agriculture, particularly in the sowing of basic grains such as corn and beans, which serve to feed his family and to be sold if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe money granted will be invested in the purchase of cattle for butchering, since there is great demand for this product and now he will extend his schedule to include Mondays, which will be for cattle butchering, and Thursdays, which will be for pig butchering. In this way, he will provide his customers with better service and obtain a better income, and he can give his family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHis projections in the future are: to have a butchering stand in town, to support his children\u00b4s studies up to the professional level, and with the acquisition of a new loan, to expand his business and offer better

He lives with his wife and their two daughters.  One of his daughters is in preschool and the other is not yet in school because she is too young.\r\n\r\nWalter has 6 years of experience working in masonry.  He learned this work from his father who he spent a lot of time with throughout childhood and he worked hard to learn how to be a mason. It is his main source of income.  Also, he does woodworking so that he can become a carpenter. On occasion when he doesn't have any work in either of these two fields, he works in agriculture so that he can provide all the basic necessities for his family.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase a motorbike and to buy the tools that he needs to improve his work so that he will be able to provide a better service to his customers.

His wife works selling fruit outside the school, and they both have a store located in their small town that provides supplies for the area where they live.  He learned this trade while working in a store, and then decided to open his own business.  He also works in other activities such as bricklaying and plumbing when he is asked to.  His business is located in his own home, but in order to buy products with which to stock the store he has to travel to the city which is located 9 km away. The loan that he is requesting is to buy 3 quintals of sugar, drinks, three cases of detergent, two quintals of beans, etc.  He says that by buying wholesale, he will spend less on transporting the products that he buys, and will also improve his business and his financial circumstances.  He says that his dream is to see his business grow through loans.  He is also thinking about rebuilding his house, as it is currently made of sheet metal and wooden poles.

Because his job abroad is seasonal, when Obidjon returns home he is left with no income.  Obidjon thought a lot about what to do and decided to start a business of selling cattle.  This is a business that tends to provide a stable income.  Obidjon already has a barn and cattle feed.  He is asking for a loan of 2500 dollars (USD) to purchase three heads of cattle.  He is hoping to receive financial support.

He is a motorcycle taxi driver, and has worked since the age of 19.  He lives with his wife and two children, a boy and a girl of different ages: the boy is 6 years old and the girl is 3 years old.  The boy goes to school.  This young man has worked on his own as a motorcycle driver, and has not had any other opportunities for work.  This is because some time ago his father left his mother, and he had to work to help his mother.  Later his mother went to the United States to provide him with a better life, and he stayed with his grandparents.  He then grew up and married, and now works day by day to provide for his family.  The loan that he is requesting is to buy parts for the motorcycle taxi, so that he can repair it as it is his means of work and the way that he supports his family.  He says that this will make things better for him, because he can then make up for the days on which he has been unable to work.  He is now working with a motorcycle taxi that he borrowed from a friend.  When the repairs are done, he will have more income and be able to pay for many things, such as the electric bill and shoes and clothing for his wife and children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1381664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

His place of work is in his community, as well as in small towns and regions nearby.  He hires a friend who has a car to transport his materials to where he needs to go for work.  With the loan he will  buy iron, electrodes and discs that he has run out of, in order to complete a welding job for a new customer who needs his services.  This will enable him to overcome this new challenge and have another customer who will recommend him to others.  Jose dreams of expanding his business, which will allow him to provide employment for other people and also provide financial security for him and his family.  His idea is to train more young people, so that they can work with him and he can carry out more commitments.  His goal is to do the best work, so that it will speak for itself about the skills that he has acquired in this business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1519438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy iron, electrodes and discs to do a welding job.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-18T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-20T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":21.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":21.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":23.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":23.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":27.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":28.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":30.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.9},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":111.31,"local_amount":111.31,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":111.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088646},{"amount":26.95,"local_amount":26.95,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":26.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216120},{"amount":33.15,"local_amount":33.15,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":33.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817475},{"amount":12.77,"local_amount":12.77,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":12.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526007},{"amount":33.84,"local_amount":33.84,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":33.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008488},{"amount":17.25,"local_amount":17.25,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":17.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500566},{"amount":64.73,"local_amount":64.73,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":64.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419416}],"funded_date":"2014-02-18T13:13:06Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:27:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":662642,"name":"Benjamin Jeremias","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Benjam\u00edn de 23 a\u00f1os de edad,  estudio hasta sexto grado, esta  acompa\u00f1ado; su esposa se dedica a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos, su hija mayor estudia  sexto grado y el peque\u00f1o aun no estudia por su edad. \n\n     El se\u00f1or trabaja en la finca desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, realizando podas, aporco, fertilizaci\u00f3n y corta de caf\u00e9.

It is made up of eight members, and is led by an executive committee of which Delfina is the president.  The businesses that the members of the communal association operate are varied, among others: selling athletic shoes, carpentry, selling lamb meat, driving, selling baby clothes, weaving, making jackets, a mechanic shop, and selling shoes.  The loan that is being taken will benefit small microbusiness owners such as Delfina.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer five years ago, after having been invited by a friend who is a member of the group.  She now has a business weaving and selling leggings.  She says that she learned this business on her own initiative several years ago, as a means of earning income.

When he was young he didn't have a lot of access to an education because of his family's limited resources.  He grew up with his parents, who helped him learn the farming labor of his household.  In time he acquired experience and knowledge in this job.\r\n\r\nCurrently Rubis works in agriculture.  Besides that, he did a course of study in bricklaying and construction, which was useful to him because now it's his main source of income.  He also has a mini-store in his house that his wife runs.  They're the parents of a seven-year-old son who's in first grade in the town school.\r\n\r\nRubis has 25 years of experience in agriculture.  For five years he also has worked as a bricklayer, which has become his main source of income.

It is made up of eight members and is led by an executive committee, of which Virginia is the president.  The businesses that the members of the communal association operate are varied, and include: milk production, cheese production, buying and selling cattle, weaving blankets, and selling food.  The loan that is being taken will benefit small microbusiness owners such as Virginia.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer one year ago, after having been invited by an organizer from the organization who came to visit her in her home.  She now has a milk business.  She says that she learned this business from her parents who did the same work, and then with a bit of capital started her own business. The loan will be used to increase her capital (by buying cows) that she will acquire from neighboring communities later raise in order to sell their milk in the city of El Alto.  This type of work allows her to earn income to help support her family, as she lives in a common-law relationship and has one child.

The businesses that the members of the communal association operate are varied, and include: weaving sweaters, selling cable TV, selling shoes, selling fish, selling food, and sewing jackets. The loan that is being taken will benefit small microbusiness owners such as Mary.  She says that this is the fourth year that she has belonged to Pro Mujer, after having been invited to join by an advisor from the organization who came to visit her in her home.  She now has a business selling shoes.  She says that she learned this business because she already knew the merchandise, having helped her mother sell shoes since she was a child.  Later, after having her first child, she decided to start her own business. The loan will be used to increase her capital (by buying shoes wholesale) that she will acquire from markets on he border between Peru and Bolivia and then sell in her business.  This type of work allows her to earn income to help support her family, as she is single and has three children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the training in health and the loans that the organization provides."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":1521592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

She now buys new furniture.\r\n\r\nThe loan is for the increase of capital (wholesale purchase of sponge) which she will buy from the fairs on the border of Peru and Bolivia and later sell in her store. This work allows her to generate what income she can for her household, since she is married and has a son.\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the medical consultations and the assistance that the institution offers to them.\r\n\r\nIn the picture one of the women is behind her co-member, because she positioned herself badly in the photo.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6025,"image":{"id":1521601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

They are working with one of the regional offices in the province of German Busch.  The group is made up of eight women and it is managed by a board of directors, of which Maria is the president.  The members do various activities, such as selling woolen clothing, food, CDs and fruit and making rugs, miniatures (for the Alasitas fair) and cakes. \r\n\r\nThe loan will benefit the group of small businesswomen.  Maria has been a member of this group for four years.  She joined after being invited to by a friend of hers who was also a member.  Currently, she has a business selling fruit.

She has been with this business for seven years. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan cycle with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for her.

Her husband also helps to earn more income via working at a construction site.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Phoeurn with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She fully repaid her past loan with success and it helped her to improve her lifestyle. For this cycle, she is taking out a new loan in order to buy a decent motorbike for commuting. She hopes that she can reduce relevant transportation costs so that she can use that money to support her child\u2019s education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1532366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal

She is known in her community as \"Tina\" as she is a person of high principles who has earned the love of others. Unfortunately she did not have the opportunity to study as she was poor. Not being literate has made things difficult in her life, not being able to sign her name for something as an example. But a well-intentioned person taught her to sign her name and she is grateful for this. \r\n\r\nNot having an education Rosa had to work from a young age. Today she works butchering animals.

","en":"Mayram is 57 years old. She is married with children and with wonderful grandchildren. Mayram is a very conscientious and responsible woman. When she was young, she was unable to study because of her family's financial problems. Her family works in animal husbandry and and she has spent her entire life fattening cattle; she helped her parents when she was a child. Mayram is very sorry that she was unable to get an education and had to work cattle, so her dream is that her grandchildren will be able to learn a profession. Mayram works day and night to achieve this goal. \r\n\r\nRaising animals is the family's only source of income. Also Mayram's milk cow produces ten liters of milk every day, and she makes dairy products. Her neighbors buy her milk, yogurt and curds. Her husband buys and sells cattle. He goes to the cattle market every month to buy and sell. Thus they live and save money for educating their grandchildren. Mayram has been an active client of Arvand for several years and has a good credit history. She is grateful that Arvand comes to help her family and, if necessary, offers them loans. This cooperation helps her family live and provide decent living conditions for their children and grandchildren. Mayram once again approached Arvand and wants to take out a loan to buy cattle and increase their herd. Mayram has high hopes for financial

good-natured woman. She is married and has four children. Turgunoy lives in a rural village with her family. Turgunoy has been working with Arvand since 2012. Turgunoy's husband works as a laborer in the city. Her husband's salary is not enough to support the family. So Turgunoy decided to start her own business, and began raising cattle. Turgunoy makes a decent income doing this. Currently, Turgunoy has several head of cattle which will soon be sold. Therefore, Turgunoy wants to buy a few head of cattle to fatten and sell. However, she does not now have enough money to buy cattle. She went to Arvand to get a loan to buy cattle. Turgunoy is hoping that this will turn out well and thanks Arvand in advance for its support, which helps her to improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1529028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-02-18T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-20T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turgunoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":202}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081223},{"amount":202,"local_amount":202,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":202,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562103}],"funded_date":"2014-02-18T20:07:39Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":671594,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is widowed with 2 children.

Such is the case that she had to work as a bus assistant with which she saved a great amount and was again able to position herself and open her business which has been gradually adding more things to sell. For this, she will take the loan she is requesting to be able to buy more items for her grocery store and thus be able to have more things for her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and knows that her business will go well having the money to be able to buy what she lacks.

He studied until the second year of high school at night. He is married and his spouse is dedicated to domestic work. She has a son from this relationship who is in first grade. So only his wife and his son depend on him.\r\n\r\nArnoldo works as a baker in a popular bakery in her city. He has performed this job since he was 14 years old. He learned it from his cousin since she had a bakery and taught Arnoldo the process to make bread. Then he went to live in another place and when he went he searched for work as a baker. He has good working references. He has come to have a lot of appreciation for being a young worker and has been given a small house to live in. His work is 5 minutes away on foot. He gets up at 3AM to bake the bread and finishes his work at noon.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help this young man a lot since it will help him buy a pole, pipeline, electrical wire and to pay for the installation of electricity since, at the moment, a neighbor is sharing electricity with him. But it is becoming very expensive. For this he needs to have his own to be more comfortable and also have no inconvenience with neighbors when he is using electricity to get up early for work.\r\n\r\nAmong his goals are having electric light in his house since, due to crime, it is not good for his son to be in a dark place. Also, with his income from the bakery, he wishes to save to build a nicer, dignified house and finally to provide education to his son so he can become a professional."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1530360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a pole, pipeline, electrical wire and to pay for the installation of electricity.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-18T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-20T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arnoldo Santana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.28,"local_amount":36.28,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":36.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903101},{"amount":40.47,"local_amount":40.47,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":40.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216277},{"amount":34.06,"local_amount":34.06,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":34.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817636},{"amount":38.06,"local_amount":38.06,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":38.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243033},{"amount":40.2,"local_amount":40.2,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":40.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526152},{"amount":42.57,"local_amount":42.57,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":42.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008602},{"amount":37.29,"local_amount":37.29,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":37.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500678},{"amount":47.53,"local_amount":47.53,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419517},{"amount":183.54,"local_amount":183.54,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":183.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544358}],"funded_date":"2014-02-21T02:17:29Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:32:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":671624,"name":"Taguhi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taguhi is from Gyulagarak village of Lori region.

and hardworking 55-year-old woman. She is married and has five children. All of her children already have their own families and live in their own homes. Tulgon lives with her husband in a small village. They love their children and grandchildren and are happy to invite all to come and visit. Tulgon works as a waitress in a local diner. She earns a small salary, but at her age it is very difficult to find another job, so she is forced to work there. Tulgon's husband and son are working in Russia, and when it's possible they send cash to Tulgon every month. \r\n\r\nNow, because of the intense cold, Tulgon is very ill and she needs money for treatment. She can't wait to earn the money, so she went to Arvand get a loan to buy essential medicines for her treatment. She is hoping for a positive outcome, and thanks Arvand in advance for their

All of her children are working abroad in Russia. Every month, they send a portion of their salaries to their parents in Kyrgyzstan. Taalaykan has a secondary-specialized education with a degree in pharmacology. She work in a pharmacy affiliated with an outpatient clinic. Her husband is a taxi driver and frequently drives passengers to their destinations. As an additional source of income for their family, Taalaykan and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. They started this business 19 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Taalaykan's hard work, she currently has 5 dairy cows, 18 sheep, 1 goat,  6 mares and 7 calves on her farm, as well as a 1.45 hectare plot of land on which she grows clover and corn for sale. The farming is very well done. The feed for the animals has already been procured. Their monthly earnings are 12,000 som (KGS).

Unfortunately Nelson is separated from his wife. This was a painful loss but it did not stop his desire to get ahead. Instead, every day Nelson fights so that time can heal his wounds and he can be happy again. Following his separation, Nelson's family opened their arms to him and he now lives with them. Nelson is from the Zumbahua parish in the Pujili canton of Cotopaxi province. From a young age, Nelson has been a fighter. He completed only primary school and, due to a lack of money, he was unable to enter a profession. Nevertheless, Nelson realised that society demands that people be educated and he completed various courses. He has now achieved his great dream of being a professional driver.\r\n\r\nNelson lives in an area where agriculture is the main source of income. The climate and lands are good for all its inhabitants. Nelson is a farmer. He learned this marvellous and demanding trade from his relatives, who saw that Nelson was the right person to whom to pass on this knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis loan that Nelson needs and has applied for is to buy seeds and manure to increase production. In the last few years Nelson has realised that demand for onions has increased as many farmers have moved to the city, with only a few remaining in the country.
