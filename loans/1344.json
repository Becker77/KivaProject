Now, he employs one person to operate this shop and assist with the business.\r\n\r\nHe enjoys the business because he has the chance to interact with different people and provide a needed community service.  \r\n\r\nSausten is requesting his third Kiva loan to help him boost his working capital at his two shops; this will help him serve more customers and increase his profits. He anticipates the third loan will make a postive impact and improve the quality of service that he provides to his customer base.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1531341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To grow his mobile money business with capital to service more customers in his community who need financial services.

Two of the oldest sons live and work in the capital of Kyrgyzstan, and the rest of the children live with the parents.  Churok has a secondary education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 39 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 300 som (KGS). Churok and her husband spent a long time working as shepherds, taking local residents' livestock to pasture for a set fee, and, hence, have a lot of experience in animal husbandry.  Thanks to Churok's hard work, today her business contains 4 dairy cows and 45 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Churok requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows in order to increase livestock headcount. Churok plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a new

She always has the desire to help people in need. Tursunoy lives in rural village. She is married and has four children. Tursunoy's children really love her because she is an attentive mother. Tursunoy is a teacher by profession. She works in a local school and all of her students also love her. Tursunoy's husband also works as a teacher in the same school. But in order to completely satisfy the needs of the family, one teacher's salary is not enough.  This is why Tursunoy decided to take up an additional occupation. She, together with her husband, runs a livestock breeding business. <br \/><br \/>Tursunoy has partnered with Arvand since 2011. The first time, she requested a loan to buy her first cow for fattening up. She has been a responsible client of Arvand thus far. By being in the business of fattening up cattle, she has been able to improve the quality of her life. Now, she has the desire to build two rooms for her children in her small house, so that there will be more living space in her home. But she does not have enough personal funds for this. This is why Tursunoy has requested a loan from Arvand this time around to buy construction materials for adding on to her home. She thanks Arvand in advance for the financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1529944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-02-18T21:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-20T21:40:08Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tursunoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":237},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":243.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":257.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":264.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":272.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":279.71},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":287.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":295.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":303.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":307.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.37,"local_amount":237,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":237.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479181020},{"amount":50.76,"local_amount":243.64,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":243.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875616},{"amount":524.87,"local_amount":2519.36,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302843}],"funded_date":"2014-02-20T22:37:50Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":671698,"name":"Rukhsana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukhsana is a 44-year-old woman.

She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products, such as shampoos, colognes, deodorants, perfumes, soaps, fabric softeners, undergarments, and other products needed in her business. \r\n\r\nMedie dreams that her business will grow bigger, and hopes to have a better living.

All their projects are home-based and they have many clients, mostly women. They are from Hodeidah, Yemen.  Amnah, the group leader, is a 52-year-old woman who is married and the mother of an adult child. She has been practicing her profession of making women's clothes for a long time. Her main business is tailoring and, due to her good reputation, she gained experience in a sewing lab until she was skilled enough to buy a sewing machine in order to open her business.

She knows that living and working close to this hub of activity is a great advantage. Veronica was inspired to diversify her food sales and take advantage of the proximity to the market, which allows her to obtain any type of meat now in popular demand. In fact, the sale of beef organs is her target during the lunch hour and into the evening. During the mornings, she focuses on selling her handmade corn tortillas and chocolate\u2013covered bananas.

Currently, Mundia has 22 employees working at his 14 locations throughout western and northwestern Zambia.  \r\n\r\nUpon receiving his first Kiva loan Mundia was able to invest in his working capital to grow the business by serving more customers needing to send and receive money.   In time, he opened three additional outlets with his increased profits.  \r\n\r\nMundia talks about how, by reinvesting back into the business, he was able to earn more commissions and with his increased revenue, open new locations.  Some locations may not be profitable for up to six months but in time all of Mundia\u2019s outlets have become profitable.  Having access to finance has fueled Mundia\u2019s expansion and allowed him to provide 22 jobs in rural locations throughout Zambia where employment is very difficult to find.  \r\nMundia is happy now because he is able to provide well for his family.  Two of his children recently completed secondary school.  Another two of Mundia\u2019s children help manage his outlets in rural locations.  The mobile money business has improved his and his family's income and well-being greatly.  \r\n\r\nNow, Mundia is requesting his fourth Kiva loan to purchase two trading booths  which he will use to expand his business further.

ha estado encaminado a buscar una mejor estabilidad  para as\u00ed poder cumplir con las obligaciones diarias, durante un tiempo busco estudiar algo que cambiara el rumbo y la monoton\u00eda  que a muchos  molesta y que al mismo tiempo fuera una profesi\u00f3n  que le gustara y le apasionara como lo es ahora estudiar servicios farmac\u00e9uticos, la idea que surgi\u00f3 en ella despu\u00e9s  de

Para ella estudiar y realizarse como persona es tan importante como lo es servir a la comunidad y que mejor manera  que brindando un servicio  con un oficio o profesi\u00f3n relacionado con el \u00e1rea de la salud.\nFinalmente Clara  busca capacitarse en el \u00e1rea de servicios farmac\u00e9uticos para brindarse un conocimiento m\u00e1s a la vida, una mejor calidad de vida para ella y la familia, tambi\u00e9n poder compartir  los conocimientos y capacidades a las personas que lo necesiten, el convenio con kiva seria de gran beneficio para ella ya que no cuenta con los recursos econ\u00f3micos suficientes para poder  cancelar el valor de las mensualidades en la totalidad y el valor que le quedan con el subsidio de kiva es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil y c\u00f3modo para pagar.  \n  ","en":"This is Clara.  She was born on August 26th, and she is 26 years old.  Ever since she has been able to think about it, thanks to the values given to her by her mother, who is her driving life force, she has worked at getting ahead and seeking to fulfill her goals and dreams.\n\nShe has been traveling along the path of her work seeking better stability in order to be able to fulfill her daily obligations.  For some time she sought to study something that would change the direction and the monotony that bothers many. At the same time, she wanted it to be a profession that she would like and be passionate about like she is now studying pharmaceutical services. \n\nShe got the idea after she discovered her interest in medication and its great usefulness to human beings.  To her, studying and fulfilling herself as a person is as important as it is to serve the community.  What better way to do so than providing a service with a trade or profession having to do with the health field?\n\nLastly, Clara is seeking to be trained in the area of pharmaceutical services in order to provide more knowledge in life and to improve her quality of life and that of her family.  She also wants to be able to share the knowledge and training with the people that need it.  A Kiva loan would be a big benefit to her.  She does not have enough financial resources to be able to completely cover the monthly payments.  The amount of the Kiva loan is much easier and more comfortable for her to pay.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1529450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay registration for a semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-18T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-20T23:40:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":150787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069836},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":150787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882784},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-12T09:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":150787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202148},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":150787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286289},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":150787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224996}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T00:38:41Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":669016,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer de 34 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja, tiene 2 hijos, una ni\u00f1a de 3 a\u00f1os y un ni\u00f1o de 11 a\u00f1os.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 30 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 1,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Gulaim's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow and 10 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).

She is married and has two children.  She lives in a small rural village.  Shoira had dreamed of being a teacher since childhood, but her circumstances were such that she was not able to receive a college education because of financial need in the family.  Right after high school graduation Shoira was married off.  She became a housewife.  Even though she is always at home Shoira never sits still.  She and her husband try to do everything possible to provide their children with all necessities.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a steady income to feed their family Shoira and her husband started their own business.  They raise livestock.  Shoira raises livestock and then sells the meat and milk.  Shoira earns a good income from this business.  Shoira's husband works at a local workshop and his job brings additional earnings to the family.  Their combined income is enough for a middle class life.  For now they do not have enough resources in order to cover all of their needs.  At the moment Shoira and her husband would like to buy several more heads of livestock to raise.  This is why she turned to Arvand and would like to take out a loan to purchase livestock.  Shoira thanks Arvand in advance for the support, as a result of which  her family's life will improve.

","en":"Nabi is an optimistic and responsible 53-year old man. He is married and has one child. He lives with his family in a small village. However, the house they live in is rather small and not in a good enough shape. Nabi's wife is a homemaker; she is a very hard-working and caring mother. Nabi works tirelessly: he grows produce and also operates a tractor. Still, the income Nabi earns is enough only for day-to-day expenses.\r\nNabi has a dream to renovate the house his family lives in. After a cold winter and heavy rain and snow, the roof in the house is worn and other parts of the house are also damaged. Therefore Nabi would like to do renovations to be able to have some comfort.

Morena is therefore the one who is responsible for her family.\r\n\r\nShe makes a living by selling candies and typical dishes such as savory pastries, enchiladas, empanadas and other items. She has five years of experience, since the father of her daughters left her and she had to make a living from this business, which she carries out at home. On the weekends, she goes to another area of her canton to sell her typical dishes. She does this together with her small daughters.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy plantain, cassava, corn, rice, oil and other ingredients. By buying this she will be able to stock her business, make more sales and obtain more earnings for her family.\r\n\r\nMorena's dreams and projections are to prepare her daughters academically, to grow her business, to be able to improve her home, and that God gives her the health to keep working so that these dreams will come true.

Throughout his life he has been a fisherman, which is the source of his income for his family.  He has a daughter who is just two years old, and his wife takes care of the household and raises pigs and birds such as chickens as another source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nFishing is the main profession practiced by people in the area and this is how Jorge earns income for his family.  One of the advantages he has is that his father taught him the skills he needed to know to work in fishing starting when he was very young.  At one time the work was difficult, but he knew that later it would allow him to make money to get ahead in life, so over time he perfected his abilities and now he is very happy and thankful to his father and friends because thanks to them he now knows a trade and his family has gotten ahead.\r\n\r\nBesides working in fishing, Jorge also serves as a tour guide on the beach.  He learned to do this thanks to an NGO which trained them to take advantage of a tourist destination, and in this way he also earns some extra income.\r\n\r\nBeing in a tourist zone, Jorge has requested a loan to invest in a small shop he has.  He will buy basic baby needs such as diapers, baby food, bottles, etc.  In this area they know that most tourists ask for these products.  Also, he will buy basic necessities like beans, rice, sugar, oil, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams is to be able to have his own house and own the land so that one day his daughter can have a place to live.  He also wants to have a well stocked store where he could have everything available.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1530778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A few days ago, the iron rod's coil was stole from his workshop, and now he is unable to make any chains to sell to earn a living.\r\n\r\nUzma has requested a loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband will be able to buy a new iron rod's coil and start his business again.\r\n\r\nUzma is a mother of three children and it is very difficult to feed all of them in a day. Her dreams are to provide all the necessities to each of her children. She is very thankful to BRAC Pakistan for this honorable favor. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1532850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a new iron rod's coil for her husband's business making iron chains.

This place is known for its traditional culture and for being a few minutes from two of the province\u2019s best beaches, like San Jacinto and San Clemente.\r\n\r\nThis is where Mar\u00eda, age 63, lives.  Her husband died years ago, however she has five adult children from this relationship.  Her daughter, son-in-law, and their two minor daughters live with her.  They are her joy.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Mar\u00eda worked for a state institution.  However, she has now retired.  When she retired she started a business.  She is a woman who does not like to be without some activity that makes her feel useful.\r\n\r\nShe sells products from Avon and Belcop catalogs (beauty items, cosmetics, perfume, and women\u2019s accessories).  She works three days a week in the mornings, and she sells door-to-door.  She sells on credit, and she collects every two weeks.  Cosmetics and perfumes are what she sells the most because they are very good and inexpensive.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use the loan to buy perfume, costume jewelry, cosmetics, and creams.  She has been in the communal bank for over seven years.  She likes it because the loans are quick.  Her goal is to have a store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1530897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfume, costume jewelry, cosmetics, and creams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Charapoto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-02-19T16:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-21T16:00:18Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1070.85,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":107.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":107.51,"local_amount":107.09,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":107.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459103129},{"amount":215.02,"local_amount":214.18,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":215.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467918008},{"amount":215.02,"local_amount":214.18,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":215.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138826},{"amount":215,"local_amount":214.18,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":215,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832737},{"amount":322.45,"local_amount":321.22,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":322.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258785}],"funded_date":"2014-02-19T18:11:04Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T12:46:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":671952,"name":"Nvard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nvard lives in Ghukasavan village of the Ararat region.

She got the idea to start this business because she needed to help her husband with the household costs. She learned in a hands-on way and has had very good results so far.\r\nShe also raises and sells chickens. She has their corrals in her yard. She has 150 chickens to raise and fatten, and 30 more that she saves in a freezer for sale. With this, she supplements her income to cover the household costs.\r\nShe will invest this loan in the wholesale purchase of merchandise (perfume, body cream, facial cream, accessories, clothing). This will allow her to have a greater variety of articles to satisfy her customers' demand. This will improve her sales and her family's income.\r\nRosa says that her age does not stop her from working hard to reach her goals and complete her projects. She wants to open a store in a commercial area in order to offer her products and make more income. She wants to continue selling for the sake of her family and in order to enjoy a peaceful old age with her husband."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1530948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Aram\u2019s older son works in a construction-materials shop as a worker-salesman. His younger son is a student. Aram is also employed working at the city gas office as a locksmith. His life has been difficult, especially the challenge of raising two sons in a way that would make them honest and smart men. Fortunately thanks to his mother\u2019s help he overcame all of these  difficulties and now their life goes on well and happily. Since they need to repair their house, Aram and his older son managed to set aside savings over the last several years, but still need more money to do the work. That is why Aram is asking for a loan for 150.000 Armenian drams, which together with their savings will be enough to repair their house and improve their

","en":"Nurseyne is 48 years old, married and raising 5 children together with her husband. She is calm and hardworking.  She cares about her children and their future.  Her husband is a pensioner and helps Nurseyne with the household.  Two of their oldest children work, and the rest are of school age. Nurseyne has a higher, pedagogical education and works as a teacher at a village school. To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 12 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 12,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Nurseyne's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 bull and 20 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Nurseyne requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls in order to increase livestock headcount.

The classes I enjoy the most are principles of science and creative intelligence, Human resources, Business law and ethics, Higher states of consciousness and Diet and nutrition.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat are your goals after graduation?\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile I would be prepared to start as a receptionist to gain experience, I would like to become an auditor at an international firm such as KPMG.\u201d\r\n\r\nTell us about your background?\r\n\r\n\u201cI was born in Pretoria in 1993. I have three sisters, Peggy, Hildah and Prudence. My father is a pharmaceutical manager at Sastel and my mother is not working. I currently live with my oldest sister and don\u2019t have any children yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\r\n\r\n\u201cI like to play music and DJ at a few clubs in the neighbourhood. I also like reading novels.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow will the Kiva loan change your life?\r\n\r\n\u201cI will have no financial problems and will be able to study knowing that my fees have been paid. This will encourage me to work even harder to achieve my degree.

However, very soon, Mher got tired of that work and he decided to start farming and agricultural activities. Now, together with his brother, they have a small, nice farm. On their farm, they have 2 cows, 5 bulls, 5 sheep, 2 piglets and 30 chickens. On their plot of land they cultivate some vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, greens, pepper and onions) and fruits (apple, plum and fig), which they mainly use for their family. As Mher says, the main income for their family is from the sale of meat, eggs and dairy products (milk, cheese and macun (Armenian national dairy-product)). All these they sell to their regular customers and to re-sellers.\r\n\r\nNow Mher is asking for a loan of 1,100,000 Armenian drams to buy animal fodder and two

Now, by asking for this loan Sanasar asks for your support to be able to purchase a cow and forage. The loan is important for his farm and he hopes for lenders' support. \r\n \r\nSanasar has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before but, because of very difficult financial conditions, wasn't able to pay it back on time. Now, by ensuring that his farm business is successful, he is able to provide monthly payments for this loan, Sanasar has been approved for this loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

In 1934, Italian investors continued their mining activity up until Albania was created as a country in 1944. During the communist era, the same activity continued, and unfortunately since the collapse of the regime, there has been no such activity. Due to the poverty level among the villagers, some children quit going to school and they dig for copper metal to sell.

They average 41 years old with 5 children each. They all live in Hamdallaye, one of the neighborhoods of Bamako, and met through neighbors. \r\n\r\nThe group members sell prepared food, adornments, sundries, fruits and vegetables. In need of increased business, the group members decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso, and are on their 1st solidarity loan cycle. \r\n\r\nSanko (the woman seated on the far left in the photo) is well known for selling prepared food, especially dishes made from grains like millet and rice. She plans on using her loan to buy 2 bags of rice, 1 bag of corn, and 1 bag of sorghum at the market. Sanko prepares the dishes, and then sells them in her restaurant in Hamdallaye to a diverse clientele. \r\n\r\nSanko hopes that this loan will help her earn an average monthly income of 60,000 CFA Francs, which will be reinvested in her business. Her goal in working with Soro Yiriwaso is to buy a plot of land to live on. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1532893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy grains.

She is single and has no children. For the past two years, Bushira has been working hard to manage her carpentry workshop, which sells chairs, tables, stools. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Bushira has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

He is 56 years old, and thirty of those years he has worked as a cobbler, making and selling women\u2019s footwear.  He has a leather goods workshop located near his home.  The income he earns from his work is earmarked to take care of the family expenses.\r\n\r\nWith the objective of strengthening his business, he is asking for the support of a loan to buy forms\/molds for girls\u2019 sandals and materials in bulk (leather, synthetics, adhesive, and decorative elements).  This will allow him to introduce new products to his line in order to expand his market and generate better sales.  He can achieve a positive financial stability for his family.\r\n\r\nMarco has always been known for the well-being of the community that surrounds him.  It is on their behalf that he dreams of teaching his trade to the young people in his area, so that they can shape their future and can set up small production lines.

She buys clothing and natural products and meets all of her customers' orders. She sells on credit so that they can gradually pay her back every 15 days. She started this business 10 years ago, when she separated from her husband and needed to get an income of her own so she could support her family. She has two children who are currently school-aged. Her most important goal is to acquire a new house, and for that reason she works very hard in order to accomplish that.\r\nHer biggest challenge is successfully increasing her sales, but her working capital is not enough to achieve that.
