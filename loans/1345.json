","en":"Brillyd Alexandra, age 21, has a four year old daughter.  She and her husband have lived together for two years.\r\n\r\nThe story of Brillyd\u2019s life is based on having many difficulties ever since she was little.  This is because she lived in the middle of family conflicts and mistreatment.  In this environment she received very little attention from her parents.  She became a mother at age 16, which was a very difficult time for her.  She did not have support from anyone.  She was in the eighth grade when she got pregnant.  Therefore, she left school in order to work and be able to provide for her daughter\u2019s well-being.  After some years, she decided to finish high school.  She registered to go to the Sierra Morena School on the week-ends.  In the year 2012, Brillyd managed to graduate and get her high school degree.  After a time, Brillyd had the opportunity to study what she always longed to, which was nursing.  This is the big dream.  \r\n\r\nHowever, at this time she does not have the financial resources to complete her studies.  She only hopes to have the opportunity to continue with her studies.  What motivates her to study this career is her daughter.  She wants her daughter to be proud of her, and she wants to fulfill her dreams.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to become the head of nursing to be able to provide for her daughter\u2019s improved well-being.  Within five or ten years with this education, with the knowledge she has gotten, she will be capable of doing things that she never though she would do.  She will be able to grow as a person and in her work.  Her daughter and her husband have inspired Brillyd to work to achieve her goals and to have the desire to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to finish with help from Kiva.  As she mentioned before, she does not have enough financial resources to be able to make the monthly payments and the expenses involved with this degree.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1531875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The member is grateful to those who form part of this dream by this means, and promises to make her installment payments on a timely basis. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1531965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy notebooks, pens, pencils and erasers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2014-02-20T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-22T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":5200,"lender_count":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Edwin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Meri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanci Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antuanett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacqueline Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Antonieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Whitney Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":14600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3442.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3579.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3721.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3856.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1226.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1274.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1373.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1226.19,"local_amount":3442.76,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3451.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467828267},{"amount":1274.84,"local_amount":3579.37,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3588.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479050564},{"amount":1325.4,"local_amount":3721.31,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3730.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490746255},{"amount":1373.57,"local_amount":3856.56,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3866.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504174850}],"funded_date":"2014-02-20T12:47:55Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T09:57:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":672248,"name":"Jesus Esta Aqui 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ysabel is the coordinator of her group 'Jesus Esta Aqui 1 (Jesus is here).

years old and married.  She and her husband have six children.  The two eldest are university students and study in the capital of Kyrgyzstan.  The other four are in school or preschool.  Makhabat has a secondary level education and she is a goal-oriented woman.  She is adept at running her household and business.  Her family's main income is the animal husbandry business she started four years ago with the purchase of 25,000 som (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Makhabat has 3 milk cows and a colt.  Her monthly income amounts to 20,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Makhabat applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy cows in order to increase the size of her herd.  Makhabat plans to invest the profits from the loan in adding more cattle and to save up money for home

","en":"Jumagul is a young, 22 year old woman from a village near the city of Vahdat.  She has not yet married and still lives with her parents.  Jumagul does not have a higher education, but she is a professional seamstress.  She works from home sewing traditional women's dresses.  Jumagul has a large family--six people in all.  She sees how difficult it is for her parents to take care of the family.  And so, like the enterprising and energetic young woman she is, Jumagul wants to start a business that she can run in addition to sewing.  The business will be fattening and selling cattle.\r\n\r\nThe family has a cattle barn and Jumagul has $400, which she saved up from her sewing earnings.  Jumagul needs another $1,800 (USD).  She is requesting a loan for this amount.  Jumagul plans to use her savings and the loan to buy three head of cattle and 240 kg of press cake for feed.  This loan is very important to her.  She is waiting hopefully for your

However, Nisreen didn\u2019t give up and instead spent years working in a salon during the day and sewing at home in the evenings to save money. Over the years she saved enough money to finally open her own salon in 1986. The income from Nisreen\u2019s salon now supports her whole family and she has even trained her daughter-in-law who works with her.\r\n\r\nNisreen wants to expand her business further by offering her clients laser hair removal, a service which is very much in demand in Iraq. She applied for an SME loan in the amount of $7,200 to enable her to purchase a laser hair removal machine.\r\n\r\nAs she explains in her own words: \"My name is Nisreen, and I\u2019ve been working in beauty salons for 34 years. My beauty salon is how my family and I make a living. I\u2019m interested in joining the WLIFT program to learn. I want to succeed as a business woman like business women abroad and I would like to learn new things related to my work such as fashionable hairstyles.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7200,"image":{"id":1530222,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2931,"youtubeId":"kr-0X4U7R4o","title":"Kiva

She is a cheerful and conscientious woman and lives in a rural area. She has a degree in education and teaches at the local school. She loves children and tries to teach them with all her heart because she wants them to have a good education. However, her salary is insufficient to cover her family's needs, so she and her husband started a business for additional income.\r\n\r\nSabohat has been a client of MDO Arvand since 2007. She has received both a consumer loan and a business loan. Sabohat says that her quality of life has been slowly improving since she began working with Arvand.

She is married to Jhon Boy, her business partner, and they have children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nFeliza is a dried fish vendor. She buys different kinds of dried fish from her suppliers then sells it in the market. Her store is located in a temporary fish market. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more dried fish needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nFeliza dreams to be more successful in her business and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

She didn\u2019t have the chance to continue her studies because she worked around the home.\r\n\r\nFor one year now she has worked raising and fattening chickens.  She learned this type of work because she needed a means of support and there weren\u2019t jobs available in her country.  She built a chicken house out of metal sheeting and wood on the patio of her house in order to raise her chickens.  It is simple but adequate, with drinking and feed troughs.  She feeds her chickens everyday and gives them clean water.  She also gives them antibiotics and vitamins to make sure they don\u2019t get sick.  She sells her chickens to wholesale dealers in the city markets, and others come to her house.\r\n\r\nTo buy the chickens, Ingrid travels in a bus that passes through her community.  The trip lasts almost an hour.  She always makes her purchases at an agrobusiness store because they sell high quality chicks at a good price.\r\n\r\nThis young woman is asking for a loan of $650 to buy 200 chicks to fatten, as well as 15 sacks of concentrate to feed them.

She can also avoid making numerous trips to the city, because those are difficult.  She will always have a supply of chickens to meet the demands of her customers.

It requires more maintenance charges on a daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means, he is unable to do maintenance of his vehicle. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Jameela has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, Jameela's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily and provide better transport facilities to earn a profitable income. \r\n\r\nJameela also plans to make savings

28 years. The couple have 4 children who help around the house and with the work. The oldest son, Cristian, is soon having a baby and the new family will be moving in. Right now the house is perfect for the family except for the lack of a complete bathroom. Jeronima works hard selling mexican food at the local market and Cesar as a farmer, to make sure the family lives well. Everyone is excited with the new addition to the family but know that the brothers will not be able to share the room and one bathroom will not be enough for everyone. This is why Jeronima has been saving to buy the materials needed to build a new room and a bathroom so the whole family can live better.  Jeronima and Cesar together make around USD 550 a month, so the house that they have today is the result of years of work and savings. Since no one in the family has a formal job and their income is low and variable, they do not have access to credit from banks or other organizations.

She is a determined and enterprising woman. Despite the fact that she only studied through the second grade due to her family's lack of economic resources, she has been able to support herself. She is married, and her husband works in agriculture, raising cattle. She and her husband had seven children, but one of their daughters passed away at twelve years old. That was a very tough blow for them, but they have managed to move on. Only two of their children currently live with them; they are the ones who help with the farming and livestock work, since the others have started their own families.\r\n\r\nCelestina has worked in raising and caring for livestock practically all her life, as it was her parents' livelihood as well, and she learned it. She sells the goods that she produces, like \"cuajada\" [a soft fresh cheese] and milk, so she has a small income. \r\n\r\nCelestina has also worked selling tamales for twenty years. She started working in that business when her husband became ill and couldn't work like he usually did. This led to her looking for a way of obtaining extra income for her family; that's how she started the business, which has given her a very good income. In spite of her age, she still continues running this business to have income for her family that helps her stay on top of expenses. She makes the tamales at her house and goes out selling in the afternoon, as she is very well-known in the area.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy a cow and feed for all her cattle, since now that her youngest son has finished school she feels that she has more time to dedicate herself more fully to this work; then she will be able to give back to her parents much of the effort that they have put in throughout her life. Her life will improve greatly because with the purchase of new livestock, they will have more income from the sale of the goods they produce. They will also take advantage of this season, as cattle are sold cheaper; that will allow her to save a little more.\r\n\r\nHer main dream for the future is to be able to have more livestock and for her children to finish their educations so that they can form their own families. With the help of the loan, she thinks that she will have more earnings and will be able to take care of all the commitments she has as a mother with her family and in the community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1517051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow and cattle feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-20T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-22T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":105.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":112.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":119.71},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":127.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":136.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":145.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":154.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.71},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":554.29,"local_amount":554.29,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":554.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903375},{"amount":343.26,"local_amount":343.26,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":343.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216052},{"amount":102.45,"local_amount":102.45,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":102.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818210}],"funded_date":"2014-02-21T19:49:33Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:44:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":672586,"name":"Yousef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yousef is a 23-year-old single young man from Deir al-Balah city.

Valeria currently has a business of selling blankets.  She has become more knowledgeable about her business since she started it 20 years ago with a small amount of capital.  Valeria began selling as a traveling vendor at the fairs in the city of El Alto and gradually built up more capital so that she could acquire a vending stall.  <br \/><br \/>The loan she is requesting now will be used to increase her capital for buying a knitting machine.

Unfortunately due to their living conditions and low economic situation they couldn't study so they had to work from a very early age to help their families with the household expenses. Today they struggle day to day to offer a better future to their grandchildren, give them better living conditions and help them become professionals.\n\nThanks to her effort and desire to progress Santos is the coordinator of the group. She sells second hand clothing  like pants, jeans, skirts, blouses, shorts, bedding and children's clothes. She spends 10 hours a day selling her product. Her business is located in her home. The aim of the loan is to stock her business with a few bales of good quality used clothing, in this way providing good service to her clients and in the near future she can generate more revenue. The \"Unidas en Cristo\" communal bank is grateful for the support of the Kiva lenders who help people of low resources and poor countries like Nicaragua to enjoy dignified work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1528667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to stock her business with second hand clothes like pants, jeans, skirts, blouses, shorts, bedding and children's clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-02-20T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-22T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":242.63,"local_amount":6176.06,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6217.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955731},{"amount":247.73,"local_amount":6305.9,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6348.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176495},{"amount":256.92,"local_amount":6539.83,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:58:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6583.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490871137},{"amount":266.69,"local_amount":6788.4,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6833.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298385},{"amount":280.78,"local_amount":7147.14,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":7195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517581222},{"amount":292.46,"local_amount":7444.4,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7494.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530064521},{"amount":337.79,"local_amount":8598.27,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8655.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542557818}],"funded_date":"2014-02-25T15:55:32Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:26:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":668523,"name":"Banco Mujer Mujeres Triunfadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Viviana es una mujer con 27 a\u00f1os de edad, casada y madre de dos ni\u00f1os.

right training for him through the Department of Rehabilitation. The government training just seemed too standardized and incongruent with the unique learning styles of the individuals who were seeking rehab treatment. She decided to utilize her background in education and entrepreneurship to start a business that could be used as a platform for training people with developmental disabilities.\r\n\r\nMary created \"Cobblestone Foods\" by combining her love for her son with her passion for organic, healthy and top-quality foods. Inspired by recipes from her aunt, an organic farmer in Northern California, Mary began producing nutritious ready-made soups \u2013 perfect for those with health challenges such as diabetes and child obesity. She hired her son as a part-time employee to help cook, manage the farmers\u2019 market, and help with bookkeeping. This not only gave her son real-life work experience but also helped him become a productive member of society.\r\n\r\nCutting back on her job as a teacher to develop Cobblestone Foods, Mary needed to seek out financing to help fund her endeavor. This loan of $5,000 from Kiva will be used to perform High Pressure Processing (HPP) testing to test the longevity of the product as well as to allow Mary to seek out non-GMO certification, giving customers assurance that no GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients were used to make her delicious soups. Both the HPP testing and GMO certification will positively affect the production and overall image of the company, therefore, increasing sales. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mary wants to be able to train and employ more people with developmental disabilities. She hopes to provide them with training through personable lessons and interactions. One of her life mottos is \u201cAll boats float,\u201d meaning that if we all help one another, everyone can succeed. \r\n\r\nInterested in trying some of Mary\u2019s delicious soups?

She studied up to Grade 4. Her husband is a day worker. They have a son who is still too young to go to school.\n\nAna has worked making bread and tortillas for the last two years. Her grandmother made tortillas and she helped her. She liked it as it is a product that  sells quickly so she decided to continue with this activity. The place where she sells is two kilometers from her house. Sometimes she goes there by bus sometimes on foot. She generally sells in the afternoons. \n\nThe loan that Ana is requesting is to buy 300 tiles to finish repairing her roof and also to buy 2 quintals (200 pounds) of concentrated feed for her pigs.

She didn't have the opportunity to study because her parents lacked financial resources. Once she became an adult, she sought to learn from programs conducted by selfless people from the community who teach literacy to adults. That way she was able to learn several things that she couldn't learn before. She's currently married and lives in a house with her husband. He works in farming by hilling, harvesting, hoeing and fertilizing coffee. They have three children who already have partners and no longer live with them. They all completed high school and each one of them supports themselves only through their businesses so they can provide a decent living for their families.\r\n\r\nEla does household chores, a work she has been doing her entire life. Besides, for the past four years she has run a small store located in her house. This has allowed her to bring in an extra income to her family. Since she grew up in a family of scarce resources, she had to learn how to do both male and female chores. Because of that she has been able to work on projects that are launched by city hall as well as NGOs. Lately she has been working on laying pavement on the streets of her community. While she's working on that, one of her daughters is the one in charge of running the store, since the hours in this kind of work are from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. She spends almost the entire day away from home.\r\n\r\nThe loan she's requesting from CREDICAMPO is to purchase rice, beans, detergent, personal care products, etc. With this loan she'll be able to buy more merchandise so she can expand her store. She'll buy everything she needs in order to increase the profits in her business. She'll obtain higher earnings and she'll save money in terms of bringing the merchandise into her home, since transportation is scarce and she has to pay for a vehicle to carry the merchandise for her. The main necessity that she'll fulfill is that she'll purchase merchandise in bulk and make higher profits.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wishes that her store expands further so that she can obtain better profits from her proceeds. She will achieve this by working harder towards having the items her customers need in her store. She wishes to see her grandchildren grow and play in a community that is safe from crime."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1531872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Actualmente, su mayor desaf\u00edo es la lejan\u00eda entre sus cultivos y el casco urbano de la regi\u00f3n, sumado al mal estado de las v\u00edas, por lo que se incrementan los costos de transporte de sus productos, para ser vendidos; sin embargo, ha logrado salir adelante, con empuje y dedicaci\u00f3n.\nEl cr\u00e9dito que solicita actualmente ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas al por mayor (abonos, fertilizantes, pesticidas), con el fin de reabonar sus cultivos y lograr obtener una cosecha m\u00e1s productiva, para poder vender a mejor precio en el mercado y generar mayor nivel de utilidades.\nEdgar manifiesta que su mayor anhelo es tener una parcela propia en la que pueda continuar con sus cultivos, pero garantizando una mayor rentabilidad para poder brindar oportunidades de empleo y tener la estabilidad econ\u00f3mica favorable para dar a su familia un mejor bienestar y calidad de vida.\n","en":"Edgar is a 23 year old farmer who is humble and hardworking. He learned the trade and tasks of farming through the teachings of his grandparents and parents. Thanks to it, today he has bean, peas and potato crops. The harvests are collected and sold in the town market. He also has two dairy cows with which he is able to add to his income to support the family. Right now, his biggest challenge is that his crops are at a distance from the center of town. On top of the poor condition of the roads, the cost of transporting his crops to be sold goes up. Nonetheless, he has been able to get ahead with drive and dedication.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for now will be invested in buying agricultural materials wholesale (fertilizer, pesticide) in order to re-fertilize his crops and have a more productive harvest so he can sell at a better price in the market and generate a higher level of profits. Edgar says that his biggest wish is to have his own parcel of land where he can continue with his crops, guaranteeing better profits to be able to offer employment opportunities and have favorable financial stability to give his family a better well being and quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1260.9,"image":{"id":1532139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She raises two children.  She has a 17 year old son and a 14 year old daughter.  Her husband works abroad and Rizqinisso raises the children.  She has been raising livestock for 6 years and grows cattle at her home.  This business helps her to cover household expenses for the family.

Due to scarce opportunities she could only study up to 7th grade, which is why she works as a clothing vendor in the informal economy. \u00c1ngela has two children, a 9-year-old daughter who attends the third grade of elementary school and her baby brother who's in first grade. Both her children attend the same school. \u00c1ngela also lives with her mother and a young niece who's 10 years old and also goes to school with her little cousins. Therefore it can be said that there are four people depending on \u00c1ngela, since she's the only one who supports her family on a daily basis, because her mother doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela got her start in the business of selling clothing in the informal economy as a last resort towards getting her children ahead. Her husband passed away six years ago, which was a hugh blow to her, but she moved on as any hard-working woman would do. Acting on advice from friends and family members, she began to approach people who sold garments, and that's how she learned how this business worked. She currently has six years of experience in this line of work. It has allowed her to meet several suppliers who have gained her trust and become her business partners. She has also succeded in building a solid and trustworthy clientele. All of these aspects combined allow her to obtain profits in order to support her family. She owns a stall at the market where she serves customers from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Sunday. She uses public transportation to get from her home to her place of business, which is approximately an 8-kilometer distance.\r\n\r\nShe's requesting a loan so that she can improve her business, that is to say, stock up on merchandise and offer a wider variety of products to her customers. She believes that she can achieve that by using 50% of the loan amount. She intends to use the rest to do home improvements, which means specifically the roof on her house. She reports that by offering more variety she'll be able to increase her sales as well as maintain and expand her clientele. In addition, she could turn hers into a more competitive business. Improving the roof will allow her to improve her family's living conditions. She had negative experiences last winter and she decided to make an investment and improve her roof.\r\n\r\nBecause of her experience selling garments, \u00c1ngela believes that by obtaining the loan she'll be able to make her business grow, diversify her merchandise and get a higher income for her family. One of her biggest dreams is to get her children ahead and have them become professionals. Besides, she wishes to support her mother, since she has been in poor health lately. With help from CrediCampo she hopes to make her dreams come true and be, as she has always been, a woman with the drive to work and get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1517112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing and to replace the roof on her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-21T04:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-23T04:40:09Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u00c1ngela Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":44.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":41.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":46.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":51.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":53.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":56.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":61},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":65.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":77.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.02},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.43,"local_amount":41.43,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":41.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088603},{"amount":50.02,"local_amount":50.02,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902866},{"amount":44.46,"local_amount":44.46,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":44.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216054},{"amount":49.84,"local_amount":49.84,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":49.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817413},{"amount":46.05,"local_amount":46.05,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":46.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242863},{"amount":52,"local_amount":52,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517525949},{"amount":716.2,"local_amount":716.2,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":716.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008435}],"funded_date":"2014-02-22T10:21:33Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:17:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":672731,"name":"Farzana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farzana is a 28-year-old married woman.

She offers many items such as rice, flour, pulses, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap and biscuits. \r\n\r\nBushra has been running this business for many years and this is the major source of income for her family because her husband's earnings are very poor. Now, she wants to grow her business to meet the needs of her family, so she contacted Kiva\u2019s Field Partner, BRAC Pakistan, to request a loan. She will buy rice, flour, pulses, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap and biscuits, and she hopes that her general store will do better than before.

She is a mother of one son and one daughter, and her husband owns a vehicle spare parts (tire) shop in the market. Her husband has been selling tires for all types of vehicles in his shop. There are the most valuable and durable company tires like General Tires, Panther Tires and Service Tires in his shop. He holds regular hours and gives perfect time to his work; that is why people like him. He speaks with a monotonous tone which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up a very good relationship with his customers. His tire shop is very famous in town. Due to his good relations, his sales have increased greatly, but he does not have sufficient stock to meet the demand. Therefore, Rehana requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of tires and tubes for his shop.

He has been continuously driving a rickshaw for many years to meet the family's expenses, but now it requires proper maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Zarina has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan for the maintenance of rickshaw. Her husband wants to buy new tires and do a little bit of engine maintenance for his vehicle. This will help him to drive more smoothly and provide better transport service to his passengers.

She buys animals (baby goats and calves) at low prices, brings them up, and then sells them out in the market at higher prices.
