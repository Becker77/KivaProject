como licenciado en\nhumanidades con \u00e9nfasis en espa\u00f1ol e ingl\u00e9s, no obstante, desde hace dos a\u00f1os ha tenido inter\u00e9s por la carrera de cosmetolog\u00eda y est\u00e9tica integral, particularmente la que ofrece Campa alto.\nEn el 2011 aproximadamente, tuvo la oportunidad de tomar cursos sobre masajes de relajaci\u00f3n, aromaterapia y reiki, estos le sirvieron para notar una falencia que tuvo durante toda la vida como estudiante; ignoramos el cuerpo para casi todo lo que se involucra en la vida cotidiana, se concentra mas en la raz\u00f3n y el raciocinio, que ignora  los cuidados y necesidades del cuerpo  f\u00edsico. Esto se entremezcla con la vocaci\u00f3n como docente, puesto que quiero llevar ese mensaje a otros; debe ense\u00f1ar, educar y cuidar tanto a la mente como a el  cuerpo.\nEscogi\u00f3 este camino y no otro, como el de fisioterapia o medicina, porque la idea de trabajar desde y mediante el cuerpo es muy amena; ayudar a otros con procesos que no involucran directamente la mente, sino el cuerpo, pero aun as\u00ed, tienen grandes impacto mental en las personas. \n\nPiensa en la salud como algo muy amplio, trabajar esta parte  lo hace posible desde esta carrera, donde la parte est\u00e9tica involucra lo social y f\u00edsico, mientras las terapias de relajaci\u00f3n lo mental y an\u00edmico. \nA futuro, dentro de los planes est\u00e1 fuertemente la idea de establecer un Spa, el cual se enfoque fuertemente en las terapias de relajaci\u00f3n y estr\u00e9s. \n\nQuiere  poder llevar a muchas personas la idea de un cuerpo saludable, no solo en el exterior, sino tambi\u00e9n en el interior.\nDesde hace un tiempo hace terapias a seres cercanos, tambi\u00e9n las aplica con el mismo, maderoterapia, masajes, terapia con cristales y gemas, esencias florales.

","en":"This is Fernando, now 22 years old, who recently graduated with a diploma in Humanities, with emphasis on Spanish and English. Nevertheless, for the last 2 years, he has developed an interest in cosmetology and personal aesthetics, particularly as offered at the Campo Alto Institute.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, approximately, he had the opportunity to take courses in massage and relaxation, aromatherapy, and reiki. These courses served to help him note a lack he had all his life as a student; we ignore the body for almost all that is involved in daily life. We concentrate more on reason and rationality, while ignoring the care and necessities of the physical body. This combined with his teaching vocation, makes him want to take this message to others. We should be teaching, educating, and caring for the mind and the body.\r\n\r\nFernando chose this road and no other for physiotherapy or medicine, because the idea of working from and through the body is very agreeable. To help others with processes that involved directly not just the mind but the body can have a great mental impact on people. \r\n\r\nFernando thinks of health as something very broad, and to work in this manner it can be done from his career, where the aesthetics portion involves the social and the physical, while therapies relax the mental and the emotional state. In the future, among his plans is, very strongly, the idea of establishing a spa, with a primary focus on relaxation and stress therapies.\r\n\r\nHe wants to be able to convey to many people the idea of a healthy body, not only in the exterior but also in the interior.\r\n\r\nFor some time now, Fernando has been offering therapy to people close to him. He also applies wood therapy, massages, therapies with crystals and gems, and floral essences. In conclusion, he would like to count on support which would be of great utility in drawing closer to the future he wishes to create and share with others, though his economic resources are insufficient. Fernando knows that a subsidy that Kiva can offer will draw him nearer to fulfilling the dream that he wants so much to achieve.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1532172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester of matriculation fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-21T17:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-23T17:30:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saulo Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":152129.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069862},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":152129.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882814},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152129.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202178},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":152129.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286319},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":152129.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225026}],"funded_date":"2014-02-21T19:56:36Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":671437,"name":"Jorge Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jorge Luis es una joven emprendedora y trabajador que se dedica a la crianza de animales menores como cuyes, \u00e9l desde hace varios a\u00f1os pertenece al banco comunal \"Siempre Juntos\" y en esta oportunidad requiere otro pr\u00e9stamo o adicional para incrementar el capital del negocio y desea comprar m\u00e1s cuyes.

Vincent has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Vincent's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support and was able to save money and feed the family.

Toli J works as a farmer to provide for his 4 children.  The community and other farmers know Toli J as trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community's activities such as the prayer group.  Toli J described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nToli J joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Toli J joined One Acre Fund so that he could earn enough to feed his family.  Because he wants to help more farmers, Toli J has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Toli J's life because he has more profits from his harvest.  In the future, Toli J hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Toli J and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase their harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete-","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-21T18:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-23T18:10:19Z","loan_amount":4175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toli J","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":358383,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358383}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":667783,"name":"Aringo's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group consists of five group leader farmers in the Matete District with Aringo selected as the Kiva representative.

","en":"Jazgul is 33 years old and married. She and her husband are raising four children. Jazgul has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Jazgul raises livestock, having launched this business 14 years ago by buying livestock for 4,000 KGS. Thanks to Jazgul\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes eight dairy cows, four mares, 29 sheep, and 30 goats. From March to November, Jazgul sells dairy product such as baked milk, \u201ckurut\u201d [a traditional   dried dairy by-product], and kefir [fermented milk product]. Jazgul\u2019s husband works on private construction sites in season. Jazgul\u2019s monthly income is 14,000 KGS. IN order to develop her farm further, Jazgul has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in order to increase her livestock headcount by buying cows. She plans to use her resulting income for an additional increase of livestock. She also plans to save for her children\u2019s further

In 2011, she opened her little general store with financial help from her family. She buys her merchandise in the market in her district once a week and is thus obliged to refrain from displaying her goods when she goes to restock her store. \r\n\r\nAfter having attended a seminar organized by Assilassim\u00e9 on how to maximize her profits, she is requesting this loan to grow her stock of oil, rice and detergent. She will then be able to restock twice a month instead of four times a month, which means she will be able to spend more time displaying and selling her goods.

Guatemala. The community is difficult to get to as public transportation is scarce. Most people walk for many miles to get anywhere, including on main thoroughfares.\r\n\r\nRecently in Chunima, a new Friendship Bridge Trust was formed consisting of nine ladies. The women honored their community by naming their Trust Bank Chunima. Their average age is 31 years and each averages three children. Most of them have only had two years of formal education. The ladies are very enthusiastic and excited because this is their very first loan cycle!\r\n\r\nThey understand that with careful planning and understanding of business and money practices, they will be able to grow their businesses. Besides learning about effective business management, they will receive other training during their monthly meetings given by Friendship Bridge staff on other topics like women\u2019s leadership, women\u2019s rights, identity and self esteem. Meetings are held in their own community of Chunima in their own native language.\r\n\r\nCarmen has been elected President of the Trust Bank. She is 30 years old and since she has never held a position like this, she is a little nervous. But Carmen is also excited and is looking forward to being an efficient and informed officer. She is also requesting a loan which she will use to purchase more medicines for her little pharmacy which is a vital lifeline for this remote community. Carmen will also use part of her loan to purchase materials for creating fabrics. \r\n\r\nThe nine hardworking women of the Chunima Trust Bank are anticipating a brighter future armed with the micro-loans and educational training provided by Friendship Bridge. They know that they must work hard and keep their goals in focus. They express their gratitude to KIVA investors for their confidence and generosity in funding their loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1533284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more medicines for her little pharmacy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chichicastenango, Departamento El Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2014-02-21T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-23T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rafaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3336},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3336},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3336},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3336},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3336},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":433.68,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3362.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479136767},{"amount":433.68,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3362.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490830657},{"amount":433.68,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3362.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256600},{"amount":433.68,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3362.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540123},{"amount":433.68,"local_amount":3336,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3362.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530023369},{"amount":431.6,"local_amount":3320,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3345.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542515470}],"funded_date":"2014-02-21T22:39:02Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T12:43:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":672931,"name":"Juvy Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juvy Ann  is 28 years old  and lives in Tagbilaran with her family.

Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are adults. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,469,725 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. Salamatu has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy bowls, tea cups and plates. She hopes that this loan will improve her stock and raise her profit. In the future, Salamatu plans to expand the business to other areas of the town. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1407126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy more stock of plates, dishes and sauce pots","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2014-02-21T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-23T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salamatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-22T08:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":506080.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467830195},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":506080.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479052606},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":506080.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490748709},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":506080.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504177407},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":506080.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462045},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":506080.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529946068}],"funded_date":"2014-02-22T00:16:11Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:06:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mari Lansford","image":623046}},{"id":671451,"name":"Vital Yovany","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vital, adquiri\u00f3 con el cr\u00e9dito anterior variedad de mercader\u00eda, lo que le ayudo a fortalecer la atienda y la venta ambulante en su veh\u00edculo, sus ingresos son mayores, el n\u00famero de clientes a aumentado lo que le genera  mayores ventas, su familia se mantiene con el mismo n\u00facleo familiar y actualmente viven en mejores circunstancias.\nEn esta oportunidad solicita un nuevo cr\u00e9dito con el fin de cubrir la nueva demanda de sus productos, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de granos b\u00e1sicos, bebidas, golosinas, verduras, frutas, jab\u00f3n, aceite, etc., con lo continuara trabajando para cumplir con sus compromisos econ\u00f3micos.\n","en":"With his previous loan, Vital bought a variety of merchandise for his store and the vehicle he uses for selling from place to place.

She is married to Jay, an electrician and she is a mother to their children. Together with her husband, Bella manages their household while operating a business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nBella maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. \r\n\r\nA customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and the item is given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog and the difference represents the profit that dealers are receiving. \r\n\r\nBella's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products needed in her business, like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other products. \r\n\r\nBella dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her children will finish their studies. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1534548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional supplies and merchandise products needed in her business, like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-02-21T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-23T23:40:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.68,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2083.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459307648},{"amount":93.35,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4167.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467888158},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5209.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479111399},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4167.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490806552}],"funded_date":"2014-02-22T00:20:11Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":673261,"name":"Mom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mom is 40 years old and a widowed mother of four children.

He only works these days in this place as that is when most people come to buy their food. But he also sells meat in his house to clients who want it. His wife sells fruits and vegetables in the market. So their sales are good as people come to buy vegetables and meat at the same time.

They fish for shrimp and all kinds of fish. When they return to shore they sell their catch to distributors or to individuals who come to buy the fish directly.

becoming a specialist in financial accounting. All her life she has lived with her mother, who has taken care of her since she was born, and has given her everything that she has needed up to now.  She is an independent woman who works in a hair salon, but the truth is that her income is not very high\u2014 and it is not enough to continue paying an expense as high as Cindy\u2019s tuition payments.\r\n \r\nThis is why Cindy is interested in the agreement that Kiva can offer. Now that she is an adult, she is trying to get a job and thus help her mother, who is head of the household and a single parent who supports her two daughters. With this, Cindy would help her to pay for her tuition and for some of the expenses.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago she registered in a program that provided professional training, which she passed; and thanks to it, she was able to increase her knowledge of everything that relates to the field of public accounting. She has been attending the institution for a year in order to increase her knowledge; and she likes it very much, as it provides her with excellent quality training and helps her personally. Now that she has the opportunity to do something for her well-being she will not think of quitting--and thus she will be able to help her mother.\r\n\r\nShe likes sports, exercising, reading, and helping at home. She also likes participating in theatrical productions and being involved with everything that has to do with culture and the arts in general. She would like to enroll in an academy and study dramatic arts. In the future she wants to become a great actress and a professional accountant, and be known as an enterprising woman with a great passion for helping those who are most in need in the country.  She wants to be able to establish foundations, along with many other people who want to contribute to the future of the country\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1532281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester's tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-22T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-24T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cindy Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069863},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882815},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202179},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286320},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225027}],"funded_date":"2014-02-22T04:31:49Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":671353,"name":"Erika","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Erika es una persona muy trabajadora y responsable vive en una comunidad al sur de Honduras junto a su familia.

Madina owns her own business, a wedding salon.  For the last seven years she has been in the business of selling and renting wedding dresses.  She likes helping brides to chose their dresses.  She has given herself over entirely to her work.\r\n\r\nNow there is a great misfortune in Madina's family.  Her mother is seriously ill and Madina needs to collect money for her treatment immediately.  The only choice she has is to take out a loan.  Since the medicines are expensive, the largest part of the loan will be for medicines and treatments.  Madina wants to use the rest of the money to repair one room in their house.  In their city, winters are very cold and there are also always problems with the electricity.  Madina wants to fix this room up with all the amenities for her mother before she is released from the hospital.

Due to his financial situation, he was only able to complete a sixth grade education.  As a result of his circumstances, he was forced to look for work.  \u00c1lvaro is in a relationship and his partner prepares \u201cpupusas\u201d (tortillas stuffed with various fillings) in order to contribute to the household income.  They have four-year-old son who is not yet in school.  \u00c1lvaro lives with his parents who are also in the business of selling \u201cpupusas\u201d.  <br \/><br \/>\u00c1lvaro sells sweet bread and French bread.  He works for a bakery that pays him a 30% commission from what he sells.  \u00c1lvaro has been in this line of work for four years.  This young man decided to pursue this job since he was not able to continue his studies and needed to generate income for his immediate family.  This is his only means of employment.  <br \/><br \/>In order to sell bread, \u00c1lvaro must travel approximately 20 kilometers each day.  He sells in all of the neighboring villages and must travel on his motorcycle.  \u00c1lvaro wakes up extremely early in order to get ready for work.  His schedule is from 5:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M. in the mornings and 2:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. in the afternoons.  <br \/><br \/>The loan he is requesting from CrediCampo will be used to repay the debt he acquired when he purchased his motorcycle.

The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her children\u2019s education and daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRamona dreams of being more successful in her business and hopes to give her family a good life.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1432076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional supplies and merchandise products like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-02-22T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-24T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-18T08:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459307652},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2679.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467888162},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2679,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479111403},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2678.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490806556}],"funded_date":"2014-02-22T17:52:56Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:16:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cheryl Strecker","image":1412668}},{"id":673394,"name":"Paulina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulina 42, offers manicures and pedicures in the morning, while she sells barbecue, hotdogs and other\u201cihaw-ihaw\u201d in the afternoon to help her husband generate income.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands.

Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. \r\n\r\nMargie hopes to have a larger network and dreams to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He studied through 6th grade basic education. He is single and lives with his father who depends entirely on him because he is 89 years old.\r\n\r\nCarlos works as a mechanic, since he was already aware of the development of pieces of heavy machinery.

Frido also sells hay as animal food, which he gathers from his plot of land. The fact that he lives in a rather crowded city and not in village life conditions, does not impede Frido from becoming a farmer and establishing a farm of his own, with the hope of having some income for his big family.\r\n\r\nFrido requests a loan of 550,000 AMD to buy four calves.

Her husband owns a clothing business, which is the only source of income for the family. He currently needs additional capital to grow the business. \r\n\r\nTo meet that need, Azra is asking for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to buy clothes to resell, so that he can respond more quickly to customer needs. He is planning to put a side some savings from the increased profits to pay for electricity and gas bills. Azra hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

She started her business with a small amount of capital and would now like to increase her sales volume in order to increase her profit and raise her children well. She has requested a loan to purchase more fish and other food (milk). \r\n\r\nPratima hopes to expand her business to live comfortably with her family. She, along with her group members, are very excited and grateful to Kiva and its lenders across the world for this kind help and support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1535010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase more fish and milk for her food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Jeypore, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-02-23T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-25T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pratima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhrmika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ainiki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudhansu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Renuka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-02-26T15:53:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":672218,"name":"Pucaray De Huancalle Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cPUCARAY DE HUANCALLE\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Pisac, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Her husband (the man shown in the picture) works in the construction business, which is the major source of their income. He is responsible for the roofs of the houses during construction.

She says that she has been with ID-Ghana for four years now through the invitation of a friend who is a member of the institution. She currently has a business selling soft drinks and foodstuffs. She began this business seven years ago when she acquired some foodstuffs and soft drinks, which she sold to new customers who are her permanent customers now.\r\n \r\nThe loan is to purchase soft drinks at wholesale from the depot and to sell them later at her residence. This work allows her to generate what income she can for her household, since she is married and has a child.\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked what she likes about ID-Ghana, she responded that she likes the medical consultations and the assistance that the institution offers to them.\r\n\r\nThe group will need a total amount of GHS 3,400 to sustain businesses.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, one of the women is

She and her husband are raising one daughter. Meerim has a secondary education.  To provide income for her family, Meerim grows crops and raises livestock. She started doing this two years ago, with a purchase of cattle for 60,000 KGS. Through her hard work, today Meerim's household has 3 dairy cows, 4 horses, 25 sheep, and 18 goats. From May to January the livestock are sent to graze on distant pastures with a hired shepherd.  Meerim also has a plot of irrigated land on which she grows barley, sainfoin, clover, and potatoes for personal use and sale. She receives a monthly income of 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further grow her business, Meerim has turned to the Bank \"Bai - Tushum\" for a loan for the purchase of sheep for breeding.  Meerim plans to use the loan income to further increase the amount of domestic animals, and plans to save enough money to purchase vehicles for transporting livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1535056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jan Bulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-23T02:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-25T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.05,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meerim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2153},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2187},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2251},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2316},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2384},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2453},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2525},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2599},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2674},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2752},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2833},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2873}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.06,"local_amount":2153,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T10:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2224.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467831162},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":2187,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2259.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053594},{"amount":45.02,"local_amount":2251,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749757},{"amount":46.32,"local_amount":2316,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2393.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178495},{"amount":47.68,"local_amount":2384,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2463.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463117},{"amount":49.06,"local_amount":2453,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2534.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947123},{"amount":50.5,"local_amount":2525,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440461},{"amount":51.29,"local_amount":2599,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2685.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":561578279},{"amount":52.77,"local_amount":2674,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"payment_id":579488879},{"amount":160.51,"local_amount":8458,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8739.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.65,"payment_id":595436072}],"funded_date":"2014-02-23T04:59:52Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":673641,"name":"Khalida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalida lives in Lahore, Pakistan.
