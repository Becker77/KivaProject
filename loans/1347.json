This loan will benefit their small micro-businesses and Felicia's too. She says that she has been with ID-Ghana for two and a half years now, through the invitation of a credit officer who is a worker at the institution. She currently has a business selling a variety of cooked food (rice and stew, fufu and soup, yam and stew, plantain and stew, cassava and stew). She began this business 10 years ago and now can boast plenty of customers who come to her joint to eat. The loan is for an increase in capital so that she can buy plenty of foodstuffs and vegetables to cook and sell to customers. She is standing on the left holding cassava. This work allows her to generate what income she can for her household, since she is a single mother with children to take care of. When she was asked what she likes about ID-Ghana, she responded that she likes the medical consultations and the assistance that the institution offers to them.

operating a retail shop in a rural trading centre in Nyabubare.   He started his business in 2002 with an objective of earning income which he would use to pay school fees for his children. He is also a farmer. The business started small since he had little income at the time he started the business, but he has been injecting some of the profits back into the business and by doing so the business has grown steadily. He works six days in a week and works eight hours per day. Elisam\u2019s clients are mainly residents of the local village and sometimes the passersby. The retail shop gives him reasonable money to cater for the needs of the family but because the children are now grown up, the needs have become many and the money earned from the business and from grain milling, which is his other source of income, is not enough to satisfy their family needs.\r\n\r\nHe has applied for a loan so that he can restock the shop, meet the needs of his clients, make higher sales and hence more profits so that he can ably cater for the needs of his family and most especially be in a position to pay all the school dues of his children which has always been his dream in life.  Elisam, however, will use the biggest portion to pay for a piece of land on which to construct a house for his family to cut on the high rent costs now that the number of family members has increased. Elisam is challenged by untrustworthy customers who never come good on their debts, but he is determined to carry on the business despite the challenge if only he could be given a boost of a loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1535109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To pay for a piece of land on which to build his family house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-02-23T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-25T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":291666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":291666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":291667,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":296400.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468059551},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":291666,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":296399.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479277385},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":291667.01,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":296400.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490973969},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":291666.99,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":296400.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504415013},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":291666,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":296399.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692601},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":291667.02,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":296400.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530922835},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":291666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":296399.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542676245},{"amount":596.04,"local_amount":1458333.31,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1481999.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.11,"payment_id":561809870}],"funded_date":"2014-02-28T18:12:59Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T15:33:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Halaska","image":1530646}},{"id":673703,"name":"Sefer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sefer wants to buy a dairy cow with this loan. \r\nHe plants oats, potatoes and seasonal veggies like tomatoes, green peppers, spinach, leeks, white cabbage and all types of greens in his agricultural land.

Her oldest is 21, and the youngest is 10 years old. Juana grew up in a farming family, and together with her husband, she still farms. The couple grows beans, peas, carrots and flowers on five acres. Juana has requested a loan from Friendship Bridge to purchase fertilizers and seeds. \r\n\r\nJuana\u2019s husband is amazed that nowadays, women can find and receive financial support from organizations like Friendship Bridge. He unconditionally supports his wife, as he realizes that this benefits the family. Both of them are excited that their children are enrolled in school because they realize that the children will benefit and face a more successful future as adults. Juana had no opportunity to attend school because of the economic situation of her family. \r\n\r\nJuana, as well as the other eleven members of \u201cEstrella del Mar\u201d, enjoys the monthly trainings provided by a Friendship Bridge loan officer. They learn a great deal and discuss issues like business and money management, marketing, women\u2019s health, children\u2019s rights and leadership. \r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank is grateful for the confidence and support of Kiva investors throughout the world. They wish to express their gratitude and best wishes to all in their endeavors.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5300,"image":{"id":1535252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Evans works two days in the shop and works two days on the farm which gives him ample time to improve the businesses.

","en":"Gulnor is a 64-year-old resident of the mountainous Vakhsh area of Tajikistan.  She lives together with her husband, her son, her son's wife and her two dear grandchildren.  Gulnor, as well as her husband and son, grow crops and raise cattle for a living.  They've been at it for 8 years, and the money they get from harvesting crops and selling cattle is the sole source of income for the family.

She's 26, married and lives with her husband in the Shahriston region of Tajikistan.  Ozoda is very shy, and couldn't bring herself to look at the camera for very long when they took her picture with her husband nearby; in certain parts of Tajikistan, people don't allow their wives or daughters to be photographed due to religious beliefs. \r\n\r\nOzoda has been raising livestock for 6 years.  She loves animals and spending time on her farm.

","en":"Samara is 22 years old, married, and has two children with her spouse. Samara has a college education. Right after high school she married Ashat, but also studied at a university. After graduation she worked as a teacher in a local school, and she is currently on leave as her family is growing, that is, she is expecting their third child. The family is exemplary, despite her young age. To earn additional income for the family Samara raises animals and farms. She started four years ago with the purchase of 30,000 som (KGS) of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work she now owns a milk cow and 30 sheep, and she also farms 2.28 hectares of land where she plants beans each year to sell. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

Two of the children work and live in Russia, two daughters are married, and the other two are school-age. Kulbubu has a high school education. She earns the primary source of income for the family by farming and raising livestock, which she started 20 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work today she owns a milk cow, a horse, 10 goats and 15 sheep, and also 2.38 hectares of land where she grows beans each year for family use and sale. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop the business Kulbubu came to Bai-Tushum for a loan to buy bean seed for planting, and fertilizer for preparing the land. Kulbubu plans to invest the income from the loan into further expanding their livestock herd, and also plans to save for the further education of two of the children.

has four children with her husband. The children are all married and living separately, except for the youngest who lives with his family with his parents and helps on the property. Kulkan has a high school education. Right after finishing school she began working as a tobacco grower on a collective farm, which gave her considerable experience in agriculture. After marrying, she and her husband began farming and raising livestock together. Her husband worked as a driver for the collective farm, and after retiring began gardening and breeding apples and other fruits. Kulkan always helped her husband with everything, and thanks to her hard work they now own a milk cow, a calf, 50 sheep, and a horse, and grow beans on 2.28 hectares of land. Their monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop the business Kulkan came to Bai-Tushum for a loan to buy sheep to expand their herd. She plans to invest income from the loan into further increasing their number of livestock.

The most popular type of bread is Pandesal, a Filipino version of the Spanish Pan de Sal or salted bread.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTheresa dreams of having a bigger bakery and hopes that her children will have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Because of the lack of capital, he is asking for a loan in the sum of 250 USD to build a small biogas digester, under the project of NBP (National Biogas Program) in partnering with HKL. After an initial investment in this system, he hopes that he won\u2019t spend much money on fuel and will lessen the smoke from wood or charcoal.

Hearing all the benefits she didn't hesitate to become a member. She has received several loans already and paid her obligations in a timely manner. Recently, Nelia requested PHP 14,900 to buy materials to use for house repair. The income she earns from their farming activities shall be used to pay off the loan she requested from PMPC<br \/><br \/>Being a MIGS member (Member in Good Standing) of the cooperative, she has been able to manage her income. She is able to provide for the daily needs of her family. Nelia is very thankful because if it were not for Paglaum, she might not have any savings at all nor be guided properly in her finances.

By requesting this loan, he asks Kiva lenders to support him with the farm. The income that he gets from selling agricultural products at the market is hardly enough to cover the family's costs, and at the same time the farm needs some improvements. \r\n\r\nSo, Armen has requested this loan to purchase cucumber seeds, fertilizer and materials for renovation of the greenhouse. This will be huge help for Armen and he hopes that lenders will support him.\r\n\r\nAs this is Armen's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products in the past because they have no credit

Sra. Neiva will use the loan to buy merchandise for restocking her business such as groceries, sweets, cookies, and a variety of soft drinks.  Her reason for requesting this loan is that she needs to restock her store for this time of year when there is great demand.  Sra. Neiva faces challenges in her business, such as dealing with the competition in the area since there are several neighborhood stores.  She will use her profits to continue buying merchandise so that she can increase her capital.

her."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1154.28,"image":{"id":1534162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

William started this business on his own and his drive to succeed has enabled him to keep it in operation for more than six years.  <br \/><br \/>William Xavier is requesting a loan so that he can invest in his business and satisfy the demands from his customers.  He would like to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for the assistance they provide to people who have limited resources and come poor countries, such as Nicaragua, so that they can work and help their families get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1525403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing, shoes, cosmetics, and other types of merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-02-24T18:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-26T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William Xavier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.67,"local_amount":4171.15,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4189.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955711},{"amount":85.03,"local_amount":2180.26,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2189.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176475},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":2049.35,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2058.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490871117},{"amount":83.95,"local_amount":2152.53,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2162.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298366},{"amount":75.93,"local_amount":1946.69,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1955.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517581205},{"amount":167.38,"local_amount":4291.7,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4310.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542557804},{"amount":73.12,"local_amount":1874.77,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1883.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579618650},{"amount":88.63,"local_amount":2272.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595205251},{"amount":158.37,"local_amount":4060.88,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4078.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610600571}],"funded_date":"2014-03-24T14:07:18Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:09:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":673181,"name":"Maria Felix","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria and her husband Pedro live in Totolapan with their daughter and two-year-old grandson.

Maria knows that the asbestos roof above their house is a health threat and that the dirt floor will only make their grandson's respiratory disease worse. Maria and Pedro have been saving for the last few months to buy materials to replace the roof and install a proper cement floor. Maria is asking for a loan to finish paying for the materials and start working as soon as possible. Since no one in the family has a formal job and steady source of income, access to credit is nearly impossible. The three (Maria, Pedro and their daughter) will work on the construction and a certified technician will supervise the work to make sure that it meets the safety and quality standards.

He is a vendor. He opened a small store he has been managing himself for four years. In this way he supports his family. Offering friendly service and maintaining good relations in the neighborhood, he has been able to build a loyal clientele which keeps growing with time. He is no longer able to meet all demand, and so he needs a loan at this time because this loan will allow him to increase his stock of first necessity goods (rice, soap, sugar, detergent etc). This will increase his sales volume and his revenue margin.

Dirasse appears in the photo with her mother. The older kids find it difficult to share a room and a bed with the little one. They also need a space to study and have privacy. Gloria has been saving for the last few months and is now asking for a loan to finish buying the materials she needs to build the bedroom. Gloria and Filiberto are not employed formally, so they have no access to credit through other organizations. Gloria is looking to give their kids the space they need without compromising their privacy. The teenage kids and Filiberto will work on the construction and receive supervision from a certified technician who will make sure the work meets the quality and safety standards. This new addition will make everyone in the family much more comfortable.

She makes sales in the afternoons three times a week.\n\nShe will use this loan to purchase more merchandise such as yucca, corn, oil, beans, bread, and seasonings, since a soccer tournament is coming up in her community.  She will be there all week, and she is lacking capital to purchase ingredients.  \n\nIn the future, she plans to continue working in the same way.  She wants to improve her business day by day and be able to work hard to move forward like she has always done.  She would like to have a fixed location in a location with more commerce to increase her profits.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1533136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has been taking care of her family and children since her husband passed away. She is a mother known for being responsible, hardworking, and having the desire to succeed for her family. For a period of eight years, Irene has made her living by managing two ventures. One is poultry and the other is a charcoal business. Irene wakes up early in the morning (5:00am) for her poultry business especially when she has small chicks, because they need to be checked on carefully.  Her business activities end up at 08:00pm but sometimes she wakes up frequently at night to look after her chicks, especially to make sure they have enough food, water, or that the light is on and other requirements. Irene is currently managing 500 chicks, but she dreams of reach up to 1,000 chicks per month. From her business, Irene is able to make a very good monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She will use this loan to buy chicks in order to reach 600 chicks, which is 100 more from her current size. Irene appreciates the loan service from Kiva via Tujijenge Tanzania since it enables people through financial support to change their lives. In the coming days, she would like to finish building her house (things left over by her husband at the roof level). \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group\u201d ALPHA NA OMEGA\u201d which consists of six members.

One of his kids is in school while the other is still young. Filbert is a businessman who devotes his time to different businesses. He runs a pharmacy, a food shop and a stored-card money-transfer business (M-pesa, Tigo pesa and Airtel). He employs a few helpers who run all sales. Last year, Filbert was in school studying for a certificate and has now graduated. He has been in these businesses for ten years now. Filbert's businesses are open from 7am to 10pm, and he is able to make a very good profit.\r\n\r\nThis is Filbert's ninth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. He will use the loan to increase in his M-pesa, Tigo Pesa and Airtel money vaults to serve more people. He used his previous loans, which he paid back successfully, to open two of his current businesses: money transfers and pharmacy. Filbert earned a profit, which he used to pay school fees for his child and his own tuition fees. Filbert also covered household expenses and saved. His dream is to build a nice family house.\r\n\r\nFilbert will share this loan with his loan group, Wazo Tegeta, which totals three members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.
