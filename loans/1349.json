She is pictured here in a group of 6 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 65 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Violet has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nViolet is 41 years old and has been a farmer for 17 years.  Violet works as a farmer to provide for her 4 children.  The community and other farmers know Violet as hardworking.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community's activities such as the women's group.  Violet described her harvest last year as excellent, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Violet\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  She first joined One Acre Fund in 2010 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to earn enough to feed family.  As an active member in her community, Violet also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she wants to help more farmers.  Violet plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from harvest.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nViolet and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

The community and other farmers know Robert is friendly, hardworking and trustworthy. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community, for example with the men's group and prayer group. Robert described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nRobert joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Robert joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family. Because he is an active community member, Robert has become more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Robert's life because he has been able to save money and feed the family. In the future, he hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and invest in a business.  \t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Robert and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment of the loan.

John joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed his family. Because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, John has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved John's life because he has more profits from his harvest and was able to feed the family. In the future, John hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and buy a cow. \r\n\r\nJohn and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

Celestine described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nCelestine joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Celestine joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices and send her children to school.  Because she likes being a leader and an active community member, she wants to help more farmers by spreading the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Celestine has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Celestine's life because she has more profits from harvest and is now able to feed her family.  In the future, Celestine hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school and repair her home.\r\n\r\nCelestine and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":1512337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-24T20:46:45Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-26T20:46:45Z","loan_amount":4425,"lender_count":159,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Winstome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":379779,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4425,"local_amount":379779,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":380992.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723043}],"funded_date":"2014-03-25T23:30:38Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jim Lee","image":null}},{"id":674497,"name":"Joseph's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph  is a member of this group in Matete District.

With much effort, she has been able to bring her children out ahead despite being a widowed mother. She has been able to support her 4 sons and 2 daughters, very hard-working youths that make a living in agriculture. Mirna only studied to the sixth grade since in that time the conditions in which her parents lived did not permit her to continue studying. She had to join in with the housework until one day she decided to start her own family, for which she currently is strongly fighting.\r\n\r\nMirna makes a living in domestic work, along with her daughters who help her with the housework.
