She lives with her parents and her two young children.  Two years ago, she started a business raising sheep, a business that has helped her increase her earnings because the market pays a premium for lamb.  She also has a few cows that produce milk, another product that sells well in the markets in and around the city, but a business that requires her to start very early in the morning because she has to collect the milk and sell it to her customers while it's fresh for their morning breakfasts.  This is Zelmira's 13th MFP loan and she's repaid all of her past loans.  She's a star among the members of her community bank.  The loan will be used to buy sheep which cost around 300 soles per head.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Panaogao Marland, Brgy IV, Silay City, Negros Occidental. Her husband Anselmo works as a laborer in Hacienda on a sugar-cane plantation.  He earns a minimum salary that depends on the time of year:  during sugar milling season, he works six days a week, but during the off-season he works only three to four days a week. The couple is blessed with four children, ages 21 to 27. They work and contribute to help support the household. Melanie dreams of improving their living, fixing their house, buying productive assets and saving enough to support herself and her husband when they grow old.\r\n\r\nShe knew that all these dreams would be for naught if she stayed at home and just waited for her husband to hand her his meager salary. She saved enough from her husband's salary to start a small general store selling only the most in-demand household commodities. When she realized that she needed additional capital to sustain her growing business, it was timely that she heard about the microcredit services of NWTF-Project Dungganon. She became a member in 2004 and from that point on, she never looked back but continued to expand and diversify her business activities. Today, in addition to her general store, she has a rice retailing business where most of her customers are the laborers who work on the sugar-cane plantation where they live. They get the rice on credit for their daily needs and pay back at the end of the week when they receive their salary. She has also put up a barbecue stand. She earns a cumulative net profit of PHP 4,400 per month.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 9,500 was used as additional working capital for her businesses. The loan was fully repaid without delay. Now she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to be used in her general store and for her rice retailing business. She needs this higher capital because sugar milling season has already started and she anticipates a higher demand for all her goods.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The representative of the group, named Brigitte, is the one whose hand is raised in the photo.\r\n\r\nBrigitte is 37 years old and is married to a teacher named Florent. The couple has five children, of whom three are dependents. All attend (or have attended) school. Brigitte has not attended school herself.\r\n\r\nFor the past fifteen years, Brigitte has been selling throughout her region the charcoal and palm oil she produces.

Ms Le Thi V. puts a lot of efforts to raise all four children. When V. was 43 years old and her first child attended college, her family was in a great need.  With the encouragement of her husband, a retired officer, Ms. V. applied for a 125USD loan from TYM Fund to open a shop selling tea, sundry goods and clothes.  Her monthly income has increased constantly in the past 11 years.  Although all her children are now grown up, and her family has become pretty stable, she has never thought of leaving TYM Fund.  After more than 10 years, V. has considered TYM Fund her second family.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

A. lives in the town of Nurek. She has 4 children. Since her children are still very young, she is the single provider for the family.  She has been in the business of cattle farming for the last 25 years. She purchases skinny animals, feeds them for a number of days, and sells them later on. This process is continuous and it brings her profits, which are sufficient for food only.

She gets supplies once a month from farmers in the surrounding villages of S\u00e9lingu\u00e9.  Once the peanuts are sorted, they are dried, roasted, and winnowed. Then they are taken to the mill for making the peanut butter (a very popular condiment among the staple foods of Mali) and for packing it into tubs to be sold wholesale. \r\n<p>\r\nShe hopes to

(pig-raising) business, aside from helping her husband in the farm as a farmer as well. It has been five years now that Catalina and her husband have been able to have a rice-farming business. This has been a great source of income for the couple so they are able to send their only child to college until graduation. <P>\r\n\r\nCatalina's loan from ASHI when she joined in 2008 was used to finance this business instead of borrowing money from other people in their neighborhood which requires bigger interest rates per month. This was what they had been doing in the past when Catalina was not yet a member of ASHI and had no access to loans. Profit then was not really big and growing a business was very hard. <P>\r\n\r\nNow that Catalina has fully paid her first loan, she is requesting a much bigger loan to be able to accelerate the quality of rice they are producing for a better price and profit. Since Catalina is still using rice land which she doesn't own, every harvest they are required to give the owner of the land a share of the rice depending how many sacks they have agreed on for every acre. Someday, through her profit and helped by loans from ASHI, Catalina wished to purchase her own rice land.

They have four children who no longer live with them since they have moved to the capital in search of a better future and a good education.  Ninda and her husband live in their own home.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works every day selling food, basic necessities, and toiletries.  At the same time, for the past 15 years, Ninda has been growing bananas, avocados, and citrus fruits native to the Peruvian jungle.  She manages her businesses by herself and enjoys her work.  Ninda is already accustomed to waking up early so that she can tend to her beloved husband and the early-rising customers who come to her general store to buy bread, milk, and chocolate for breakfast. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the evenings, she takes a rest.  Since there are no stores that are open late, she has neighbors who come by to her establishment when it is closed and knock on her door requesting to be served.  \u201cIt does not bother me because the poor have no other place to shop,\u201d says Ninda.  She considers her business to be very profitable and emphasizes that her earnings have enabled her to educate her children and cover the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nAs an entrepreneur, she has plans to open another grocery store or hardware store across from her home.  In addition, she wants to finish construction of the second floor of her house and turn it into a tourist lodge.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.

He, his wife Ana, 22, and their little daughter, live in his parents' house. She works in a factory.   Since he was 10 years old, this hardworking man has dedicated himself to the transport business.  At the moment, he works as a conductor  on one of the area's public transport lines.  He is very happy with his work, since he receives a regular income, which allows him to offer his family an adequate quality of life.  He enjoys taking payment from his regular customers, although he doesn't like it when people don't want to pay the actual price and cause trouble.  He works four days a week from 5 am to 9 pm and rests on the weekends.  In the future, he hopes to turn himself into a driver, since he knows how to drive and wants to increase his income. He also wants to install a grocery story in his home, and for this reason, he has begun to prepare a space for this shop.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with microfinance partner MFP, and he promises to pay his installments promptly.  The loan will allow him to keep working to better his conditions.  Nelson plans to invest the funds in restoring part of his house.  He needs to change the roof, which already has some holes in it, and thereby start preparing his home for his grocery store business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":628106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To restore the roof of his house and to install a shop in it.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":139.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588806},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":139.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725303},{"amount":100,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":278.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886785}],"funded_date":"2010-11-01T11:36:17Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":247271,"name":"Ly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The young woman in the photograph is Ly S., age 31, who lives in the province of Kompong Cham, the best territory for farming. \r\n\r\nLy S. is a married woman who is devoted to her three young children, who attend school and depend on her care.

She is 59 years old, married and has five adult children. To make a living, Perla owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, snack foods, and beverages in the local community. Perla has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Perla joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Perla is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods and beverages. This loan will be Perla's fourth loan from HSPFI.

She will use the 3000 new soles to buy more medicine to stock her drug store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":822633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy medicine to stock her pharmacy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-25T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":203.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":210.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":221.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":226.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":237.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":240.94},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":253.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":264.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":282.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":290.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":299.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.1},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.59,"local_amount":203.42,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":204.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350791},{"amount":77.28,"local_amount":210.78,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":211.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851153},{"amount":81.21,"local_amount":221.48,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":222.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666329},{"amount":83.02,"local_amount":226.42,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":227.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621486},{"amount":86.96,"local_amount":237.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":237.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835559},{"amount":88.34,"local_amount":240.94,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":241.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245319},{"amount":608.6,"local_amount":1659.81,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1665.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098549}],"funded_date":"2011-07-25T23:25:31Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":325131,"name":"Catherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Catherine is a 37-year-old rice-growing farmer, she is a widow with three children.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

members of the group \"Benkadi 3\" are married women averaging 30 years of age and four children each all living in traditional families in Bougoura, a village in San (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The women are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to carry out their farm work during the wet season. They are on their fifth loan with the institution. The past loans have indeed been paid back. \r\n\r\nThe crops grown are rice and peanuts, as is the case with NANA, the first one seated from the right in the photo.

With this goal in mind, they decided two years ago to start raising guinea pigs. In earlier years they had practiced agriculture, but due to the physical effort involved and for health reasons, they had to give it up and sell all their plots of land, so that they could devote themselves entirely to this new business venture. \r\n<p>\r\nDay by day they wait for their guinea pigs to grow, watching the fruits of their investment with satisfaction. In order to house the new members of this small business, they plan to improve the facilities of their farm and become better prepared in order to obtain better results.

She is married and has three children. For 11 years, she has worked as an operator for the \u201cTojiktelecom\u201d company in Vakhdat city. She works from morning to night for a small salary which she uses to feed her family. Her husband takes on odd-jobs also bringing home a small salary.

Nkwaateng is in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A sizeable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. However, quite a large number of women are involved in palm oil production. Augustina is one of the women who actively produce palm oil. She has been in business for six years. \r\n\r\nShe buys the palm nuts from the local farmers in her community; processes it in her house to produce the oil and sells at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from the food of the palm fruits. It has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours. The reddish substance (the oil) is skimmed off and boiled again to expel water content. Augustina wants to use the loan to expand her business by buying the palm fruits in bulk. She will then be able to increase the number of customers she serves.  She owns a refrigerator and uses it for the sale of sachet water to support her family with additional income.\r\n\r\nShe believes the loan assistance would enable her to scale up production to serve a larger market and, eventually, help improve her family finances. She is a member of a Trust Bank group called Kingdom Trust Group.

This is Polly. He is the Deputy Head Teacher of Ryakasinga CHE School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Kabwohe in Sheema with 800 students. Ryakasinga CHE School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nRyakasinga CHE School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Polly ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2050863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Sheema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ryakasinga Che School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3817300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2018-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477166}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":621,"name":"Bridget","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'\">Bridget is the chairlady of Karura Mwangaza Women Group and a retired primary school teacher.

She lives with her children, Melani, 14 and Andi, 4 years of age. For the past 8 years she has been selling clothes for a living in order to maintain her young children. Marivel begins work daily at 8 a.m. and finishes at 5-6 p.m. Fortunately sales are good as she is very charismatic and therefore she receives good economic income to create welfare for herself and her family. But to work alone is difficult as she misses her children during the day.

A sizable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. An appreciable number of women are involved in palm oil production.  Emmanuel identified this as a business opportunity and bought three sets of milling and processing machines to start commercial palm nut processing in his community. \r\n\r\nHe has one set of machines that pound the cooked palm nuts, and another one that extracts the oil from the palm nut fiber. His services have greatly reduced the drudgery that was previously associated with palm oil extraction and processing.\r\n\r\nSince palm oil production is increasing in his community, he seeks a loan to enable him to buy additional milling and processing machines as well as accessories, in order to provide satisfactory and on-time services to his clients. He believes the loan will enable him to increase production and thus to serve a larger market. Eventually, the income will help improve his family's finances. \r\n\r\nEmmanuel is a member of a Trust Bank group called Temple Trust Group. Members in this group guarantee for one another, as social collateral, so as to access loans, and they support one another in handling the repayment of a loan. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":287250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To procure milling machines and accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Nkawkaw","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.55 -0.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-03-14T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":181.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36029752},{"amount":130,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":181.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44616052},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":90.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53013520},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":90.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53013521},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":90.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63235557},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":90.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63235558},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":90.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73666932},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":90.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73666933}],"funded_date":"2009-03-15T06:44:45Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:17:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":98950,"name":"Vasile","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vasile is 35 years old and he is the father of three children.

This business has allowed her to help the finances of her home. Recently, with the savings she managed to put together with this activity, she installed a small store in her house. This business has been accepted gratefully by the locals because she lives far away from town and they don't usually have access to basic day-to-day products nearby.\r\n\r\nAlberta wishes to increase the size of the store by buying more products, so she can get more profits and satisfy the demand in the zone. She also wants to acquire feed for the animals. This is why she needs to request a 1500 nuevos soles loan to Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nAlberta is a woman who is devoted to her family and that is always working for their development and well-being.

It still exists and at present she sells soft drinks and artisan crafts. \r\n\r\nDuring the local fairs Jenny exhibits her products and has to look for an assistant because sales increase and she can't attend to all the business. Her largest sales occur during June and July, and between December and carnival, when many people buy back packs and attire to add to their costumes.\r\n\r\nJenny is a very responsible with her obligations and she is notably punctual in her payments. Her children are all professionals and this has been achieved with her help and the discipline required by their studies. Her principal customers are passers-by and she uses suppliers in Cucuta in the north of Santander, where her children live and can help.\r\n\r\nThrough her work, Jenny has acquired her home and a stall which she rents in the popular gallery of the city of Valledupar. This 'credikiva' will be her 5th loan received through the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. Jenny will buy artisan crafts, and general merchandise to restock her kiosk, because the era when her sales pick up is very near and she needs to be prepared if she is to continue successfully responding to her decision to make her business grow.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":795033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy artisan crafts and general merchandise to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-22T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":159532},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":162191},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":164894},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167642},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":170436},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":173277},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":176165},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":179101},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182086},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":185121},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188206},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":191349}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.26},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.26},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.8},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89.26,"local_amount":159532,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":160046.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673851},{"amount":90.75,"local_amount":162191,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":162714.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320409},{"amount":186.06,"local_amount":332536,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":333608.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803527},{"amount":95.36,"local_amount":170436,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":170985.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614613},{"amount":96.96,"local_amount":173277,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":173836.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779907},{"amount":98.57,"local_amount":176165,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":176733.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188302},{"amount":306.4,"local_amount":547615,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":549381.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324531},{"amount":104.58,"local_amount":186899,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":187501.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140382},{"amount":107.06,"local_amount":191349,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":191966.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100336}],"funded_date":"2011-07-15T18:25:23Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:09:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":312866,"name":"Tatiana Rosibel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Tatiana Rosibel de veintis\u00e9is a\u00f1os de edad vive con sus dos hijos.

The main source of income for Zeby's family is animal husbandry, started by her in 2006. Having started with a sum of 32,000 som (KGS), her farm today brings in around 14,000 som (KGS) per month. The income from the business allowed Zeby to pay for tuition at the university for her son. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Zeby turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of three calves for fattening and resale. Zeby plans to invest the income in further increasing the number of livestock, and dreams of seeing her younger children as university students in the future.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa.

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

She lives with her partner, and they have two children. One is eight years old, and the younger one is five months old. She lives in the house of her partner's parents, where on a daily basis she shares the joy of raising her children and working hard to provide them with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nJeimy's work consists of a nighttime food stall. Every day she goes out at 5 p.m. to put out her tables and set up her kitchen, where she prepares the various dishes to offer to her guests. Besides selling food, she also sells beauty products. She has been making these sales to her friends, neighbors, and relatives for the last four years, while she has been selling food for the past year. She really likes what she's doing, since having two activities provides her with two incomes, and that gives her greater financial security. At first she was afraid, like anyone just starting out with their own business. With time, however, she overcame that, and now she is a large source of income for her household. Her future plans are to be able to expand her business and increase what she does. \r\n\r\nThis will be the third loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support, since that makes her feel calmer as she does her work. She promises to continue being a punctual client, as she was with the prior loans that she had. She is very comfortable as part of her communal bank, since they are all very friendly and supportive people.

He lives with his wife and 9 year old daughter, and helps his other two children who are grown up and independent. He relies completely on rice farming to feed his family, as his lands are only productive for this activity. He was born and raised in Baba and learned to farm rice from his father. He wants to make his land more productive by plowing them with rented machinery. In the long run, he wants to save for his daughter\u2019s education. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of one the new Communal Banks formed in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Anzuelo Baba Communal Bank are part of an association of rice farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their organization, El Anzuelo Asociacion, works cooperatively to help their members cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. Most recently, El Anzuelo was able to start a program that improved their members access to watering services..  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of La Asociacion El Anzuelo de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":30429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-18T22:53:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-03T08:58:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-06-16T16:56:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23689},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T21:37:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33123},{"amount":517,"local_amount":517,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:23:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":517,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99066},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T17:01:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210204}],"funded_date":"2007-04-19T08:58:58Z","paid_date":"2008-05-14T17:01:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12942,"name":"Chuon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chuon S. is 30 years old and mother of 1 child.

She studied through the second year of secondary school, but was forced to stop because her parents could no longer support her because they were very poor.  Maria married Fernando Azabache and they have 2 children, who are their dependents.  Maria began her business by selling toys, and later began to sell food as she saw that it was more profitable, but she did not have the capital.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 38 years old. Geraline is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Geraline owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling bananacue to the local community. Geraline has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Geraline joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Geraline has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from GDMPC. Geraline is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Geraline from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
