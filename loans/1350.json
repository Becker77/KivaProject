He lives with his mother, wife, two sons, daughter-in-law and an infant granddaughter.  The only source of family income is a cow, whose milk is used in cheese products.  Kakha's wife milks the cow everyday and makes cheese to sell at local markets.  \r\n\r\nAs the income is not enough for such a large family, Kakha decided to build a greenhouse, as he has land near their house. The startup loan program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, enables him to get a loan of 5000 gel.  He will purchase all the building materials and will build a greenhouse where the family will grow vegetables. Kakha will also renovate the mill and will take orders to grind the cereals and generate additional income. \r\n\r\nThe startup loan program will be a great support for the family.

He sells harvested products locally and earns approximately 350 GEL per month. As the existing income is not enough to meet daily costs and save for his family, Kurban decided to start his own business. The start-up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, will enable him to get a loan of $3,200 to purchase a secondhand car. Kurban will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them throughout the city. This credit will offer great support to his family.

He plants and harvests wheat and corn, which he then sells to generate more income. He is very satisfied with this work and having the opportunity to provide even additional income for his family, since the salaries that he and his wife receive are low. \r\n\r\nNikolla requested a loan 1,400 Euros for the first time in order to buy new working tools for his tractor.

He is very professional and works very fast and efficiently, gaining much popularity and many repeat customers. \r\n\r\nArmend has worked in this field for over seven years now. He gained his experience for the first four years by working for someone else and, in the last three years, by working for himself independently. His main projects and business include making different types of iron products for private companies and individuals. He really enjoys his work and is satisfied with the income he generates. \r\n\r\nSince this business is the main source of income for his family, Armend is requesting a loan to purchase new tools and raw materials to improve his current business and expand it as well. This will allow him to increase his profits and, therefore, his family's standard of living and quality of life. He is very grateful to the lenders for their help and support.

Her children are often ill due to the conditions of their house especially in the cold and wet winter months when poor insulation allows mold and other bacteria to enter the home. Since they have always been poor, Suzana and her family have been unable to change their living conditions or save money to make repairs to help their health.\r\n\r\nSuzana is requesting a loan to replace the doors and windows and fa\u00e7ade on the inside and outside of her house.
