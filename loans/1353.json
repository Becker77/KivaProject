At her home, it is only her and her husband, who works in agriculture, planting and growing coffee, and in apiculture (keeping bees to sell their honey).  They have had the apiculture business for over ten years, but their main source of income is the coffee crops, as their customers are different markets, neighbors, relatives, friends, local stores, etc.  She has an incomplete primary education, as she only attended school through the third grade because her parents had little money and were not able to support her when she was a child.  She and her husband acquired the land they work through a great deal of hard work and sacrifice; it is located 20 minutes from their home and they get to it on foot.   \r\n\r\nHer dream is to keep expanding her coffee crops, improve their cultivated land with better labor, and be able to expand their land by buying so they could be more competitive in the market with varietals such as caturra and catuay, which are attractive to their customers; this would allow them to earn more profit to keep on working.  For these reasons, today she is requesting a loan from COMIXMUL to buy farming supplies, such as manure and fertilizers, among others, which will allow her to provide her coffee crops with more and better care.

Currently their good management has allowed her and her husband to purchase unused land, and the profit from this harvest will hopefully allow them to put it to use next year and have five acres planted, which is more than they currently have.

She was only able to get a third grade education as her parents could not afford more.  She is the mother of ten children, six of whom work and the other four attend the local primary school where they are in different grades.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Carmen and her husband work every day to cloth and feed their children and give them everything they need.  For seven years she has been selling coffee, although she has worked for 15 years in farming.  The cropland belongs to the family and was bought thanks to the efforts and good management of savings.  It is located 15 minutes away from their home so they can walk there.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Carmen dreams about her childrens' future and wants them to become professionals, and she also wants to farm a wider variety of crops.  This would attract more customers and generate more income so she could meet her goals and accomplish her dreams.  Therefore, she is requesting a loan through the COMIXMUL co-op to buy Nutricafe, Formula 18-46-0, urea, plant fertilizer, ALTO 10 SL, Formula 12-24-12 and coffee plant formula for her crops in order to insure a good harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":737.5,"image":{"id":1533296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm supplies for her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-02-24T22:26:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-26T22:26:05Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":737.5,"local_amount":14500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14561.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762638}],"funded_date":"2014-03-24T19:50:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":672174,"name":"Modesta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Modesta tiene una edad de 62 a\u00f1os, casada y madre de 8 hijos quienes est\u00e1n adultos y en hogares aparte, con un grado de estudio cursado hasta el segundo grado.

Her hard work and her honesty in business have helped her greatly to grow the business; by doing this she gains customer loyalty. \r\n\r\nZabibu is challenged by the stiff competition in the area she operates in but she is hopeful that if she gets a loan she will be able to buy more stock and make bigger sales, which will help her business to grow to greater heights. \r\n\r\nPictured is the group, but the lady at the extreme right is the area Councillor who mobilized the group. Although she is not taking the loan, she signed the waiver for it. She thanks UGAFODE for serving the needs of her community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1536107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I developed a love for carving at a tender age. My late uncle was a very skillful carver. I used to sit with him at his workshop to observe how he went about his carving, when I returned from school. I just loved the beautiful items he carved along with other carvers at his workshop. He would sometimes give me pieces of wood to try my hand at sandpapering and I worked with him for 15 years. Before he passed on, he handed over his workshop to me and, since then, I have continued to produce quality items just as I was trained. It took hard work, determination and consistent practice to become a master of this art. Now I train people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be very thankful to all of you for helping me get money to produce my designs.

Last May, the group successfully paid it back in full! Currently, the twelve members of the Trust Bank are requesting an additional loan, funded by Kiva investors through Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nThis Trust bank is located in the hills of San Francisco El Alto in the department of Totonicapan, Guatemala. The local economy thrives on hundreds of small family-owned and operated clothing fabricators. People in the area are also engaged in weaving as well as animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nFlorinda is a 40-year-old married member of the Trust Bank. She has six children who range in age from 7 months to 15 years. Florinda and her husband are both tailors and produce tee-shirts. Due to high demand, Florinda is requesting a new loan which she will use to invest in a new sewing machine. It is important for her to keep her production line moving. Florinda is so grateful to have access to working capital which not only benefits her but also her family. She realizes the importance of education and wants to keep her children in school.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank Vision have created a strong circle of support with each other. In each monthly meeting, they emphasize the confidence and accountability that they have with one another. Their goal to continue together for many more loan cycles and maintain an excellent credit record. In addition, they are gaining a lot of useful knowledge each month with the Friendship Bridge Loan Officer who presents various educational trainings on relevant and useful themes like money management and budgeting, nutrition and health, women\u2019s rights and self-esteem. It is the combination of the loans and education that makes the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge so useful for the women. They can step into a more prosperous, successful and educated future, ensuring that future generations will not have the same struggles as they have experienced. They want to share that they are very grateful to Kiva investors for believing in them and funding their loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":1536356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to
