He is looking for a way to improve his family's living conditions. Gabriel has thought about increasing his livestock. He currently has nine livestock. Four are his own and the rest are his mother-in-law's. He is a responsible person and was able to gain respect as a rancher. He is always thinking about satisfying the demands of his customers who have confidence in the livestock he sells. \r\n\r\nHe is applying for a loan to buy more livestock to offer his customers. He wants to buy four more cows. He thinks that offering more variety could improve his sales and would also allow his business to be more competitive. \r\n\r\nOne of his greatest dreams is to move his family forward. With the help of CrediCampo, he hopes to be able to make his dreams a reality and be as he has always been: a man with hopes to improve himself.

Guatemala, called Quetzaltenango. A Friendship Bridge Trust Bank named Santa Maria is located here and is composed of thirteen animated and strong women. They have collectively decided to apply for a new loan with Friendship Bridge. \r\n\r\nThe ladies work in various commercial ventures, including the sale of food (chicken, meat, fruit, vegetables, bakery items, pastries and tortillas), medicine, clothing, including lingerie, the sale of firewood, as well as catalogue sales. The women are quite industrious and motivated.\r\n\r\nElena is a 39-year-old member of the group. She has four children. Both Elena and her husband work in their bakery and sell pastries and bread. They have two locations, one of which belongs to them, while the other is a rented one. The couple works arduously seven days each week. \r\n\r\nElena is starting her second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. She plans to use the funds to purchase ingredients like flour and eggs. There is a high demand for the bakery items, including bread and cakes, and so Elena is planning and budgeting carefully.\r\n\r\nElena and the other women in the Santa Maria Trust Bank feel blessed and grateful to have businesses where they can improve their quality of life. They are most grateful to Kiva investors who have generously funded their loans. The Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge does more than make funds available for clients. Each month, the women meet with a loan officer from Friendship Bridge. Besides making payments on their loans, the ladies receive educational training on relevant subjects like effective business practices and money management, nutrition and health, as well as children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights. This month\u2019s topic was about leadership and women\u2019s identity, where the women learned about discrimination and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen women of the Santa Maria Trust Bank look forward to a brighter and more prosperous future for themselves, their families and their community. Empowered by their educational training and loans, they step into the next chapter of their lives with confidence and determination! Thank you, Kiva investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5650,"image":{"id":1536340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Farkhunda is a young married woman who lives in the Shahrituz region.  She is 22 years old and she worked as a seamstress in a sewing shop until the shop closed because of tax evasion.  At the moment, Farkhunda works as a caretaker at a hospice, which covers part of her family's expenses.  She really wants to return to her previous work as a seamstress, but now she has resolved to work for herself and to open her own business out of her home.  Farkhunda has nearly $300 in hand to fulfill this goal, but she needs a loan for the rest.  She wants to buy a sewing machine and fabric for sewing.  Farkhunda is a very experienced seamstress and she has thought of several different dress styles all by herself.  She won't have any problems with her commissions, as everyone in her neighborhood knows about her talents as a seamstress.  She is anxiously awaiting your

She is a single parent bravely raising three children.  PMPC supported her by providing the capital to start her pig raising business. She sold one pig at a time, helping the family survive. She gives her best efforts to produce good pigs in order to sell them continuously. \r\n\r\nFrancisca is now trying to expand her pig business and has decided to venture into a little snack house. She presented her project proposal to Paglaum MPC to finance the project and has applied for a loan of PHP 10,000 to buy additional sacks of feed.  She is thankful to Paglaum MPC for financing her capital needs. In addition, she wants her business to be well known and to build good business management for her loyal customers.  With her extra income, she wishes to send all her children to school so they may have stable careers.

","en":"Latofat is a joyful, kind, and hardworking woman. She is married and has three wonderful children. Unfortunately Latofat did not receive an education as a young person, which she greatly regrets. She wants her children to study at the best schools, and does everything to reach this goal. Latofat's work is selling groceries. For over 10 years she has been selling at a market close to her home. She used to sells herbs and a few fruits at the city market, so she had to travel from her house to the big marked to sell on the street of the market. It was difficult for her to travel with her goods to the city to sell there, so she began renting a place near the house. Now she sells groceries, various cookies, bread, and candy there. Latofat has been working with the organization Arvand for over eight years. During this period she has earned a large number of customers. This is their primary, stable, income for the family. Latofat wants to buy products to fill out her inventory. She is very happy that there are organizations like Arvand which people who need help with financial support and use to reach their goals and dreams.

","en":"Husanboi is a kind, hardworking person. He is 58 years old, and has worked in the fields since he was a boy. At first he was a worker on a collective farm, and over time became a farm foreman. Like all of the residents of the village, Husanboi has also raised livestock for many years. He has livestock on his property, and his sons help him. Husanboi has a friendly and close family, and they all live together. Husanboi's wife Zainab keeps the house, and a teacher by training. She teaches at a middle school. She loves children and does everything she can to give all her knowledge to them. Husanboi's oldest son left for Russia to work, since it is hard to find work in the village and doesn't earn enough money to live on. Husanboi currently farms. As we already noted, he has a lot of experience in this area. He would like to plant corn and wheat, but doesn't have the money for planting. He wants to buy fertilizers and seeds, so he came to Arvand for a loan.

He went to school until third grade.  He has been married for 16 years and his wife takes care of the household chores.  He has five children who live with him and go to school.  As such, all of Mardoqueo's family is financially dependent on him. \r\n\r\nAgriculture has earned Mardoqueo his living for 25 years.  He learned the trade from his father.  When he was very young, Mardoqueo's father taught him to grow basic grains.  Mardoqueo decided to make his own living with this work since he didn't have the opportunity to go to much school and it was the only way he knew of to help his family.  Where he works is two kilometers away, a distance he travels on foot.  His eldest son and his wife also help him with his work, which he performs for seven hours a day. \r\n\r\nMardoqueo is requesting the loan to purchase a team of oxen to aid in transporting his grains to his house.  He doesn't currently have this kind of work tool, and it is difficult for him to transport his grains.  With the help of the loan, transporting his agricultural products will be easier and assure his ability to feed his children. \r\n\r\nMardoqueo's dream is to progress in life though his work.  He would like to have more land to plant and be able to harvest more product, which would improve his income and give his family a better quality of life.

He is married, and just recently started a family. Gairat has a young, loving family. They live in the parents home. Gairat, like all village residents, raises livestock, but it isn't his primary job. He also works in the fields, raising crops. Gairat loves working in the fields, as only there can he breath in fresh air and admire nature. Towards spring field work picks up and Gairat has practically no free time. He is currently preparing ground for planting. He needs money to buy fertilizer and seeds, but doesn't have enough saved up, so he came to Arvand for a loan. Gairat is getting a loan now, and in the future would like work more with the organization since he finds their service useful. Gairat thanks Arvand for the support and trust in advance.

She hopes to be able to continue working in her business for a long time.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to open another store dedicated to the same business, with the goal of having a better stocked and larger business, from which she can obtain income that will help her support herself, along with her daughter and her 4-year-old granddaughter. She thinks she can achieve this with much effort through work and the help that CrediCampo offers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1534332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy products for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-25T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-27T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Delmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":29.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":30.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":31.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":31.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":41.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.3,"local_amount":38.3,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:51:25Z","rounded_local_amount":38.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903165},{"amount":37.05,"local_amount":37.05,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":37.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216335},{"amount":38.37,"local_amount":38.37,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":38.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817703},{"amount":40.69,"local_amount":40.69,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":40.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243091},{"amount":41.75,"local_amount":41.75,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":41.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526206},{"amount":42.92,"local_amount":42.92,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:20:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008660},{"amount":44.06,"local_amount":44.06,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":44.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500723},{"amount":116.86,"local_amount":116.86,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":116.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419561}],"funded_date":"2014-02-25T15:28:00Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:28:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":673071,"name":"Cielito Lindo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cCIELITO LINDO\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Alto Lima, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Soledad es la Presidenta.

es Katherine, Caracterizada por ser una persona sencilla,  directa, car\u00e1cter maduro, carism\u00e1tico, sensible, fr\u00e1gil, juicioso, trabajador, responsable y comprometido. \nNacida el 2 de Abril, despu\u00e9s de la separaci\u00f3n  de los padres, la madre se va para otra ciudad, donde vive la familia, en donde se radica a vivir con ella, la mama empieza a trabajar, para responder por la hija, la cual comienza a crecer cada d\u00eda mas, en esos tiempos ocurre una de las perdidas familiares m\u00e1s significativas para el n\u00facleo familiar, la muerte del abuelo, 14 meses despu\u00e9s el fallecimiento del  t\u00edo,  consecuencias que llevaron al cambio de lugar de vivienda.\nAlgunas veces la madre tuvo la obligaci\u00f3n de dejarla en varios lugares donde amigos para el cuidado de la hija, en donde llegaban hasta una semana que no se ve\u00edan, por cuestiones de trabajo para la manutenci\u00f3n y educaci\u00f3n de la hija. A pesar de esa falta de convivencia entre mam\u00e1 e hija,  Katherine siempre fue una excelente estudiante, con un buen desempe\u00f1o acad\u00e9mico, sue\u00f1os, ilusiones y metas propuestas.\nEmpezar a realizar una carrera despu\u00e9s de salir de und\u00e9cimo es el sue\u00f1o de cualquier persona, el \u00bfQu\u00e9? El \u00bfD\u00f3nde? Y el \u00bfCu\u00e1nto? Son las principales preguntas que pasan por la cabeza cuando esta a unos cuantos meses de salir del colegio.\nLos inconvenientes eran el \u00bfD\u00f3nde? Y el \u00bfCu\u00e1nto?, ya que solo contaba con la madre como apoyo econ\u00f3mico, en ese tiempo la madre no contaba con un trabajo, ni un sueldo estable, por ello el Sena ser\u00eda una buena opci\u00f3n de estudio; debido a que en grado d\u00e9cimo se empez\u00f3 a realizar un curso en el colegio con convenio con el Sena, este se llev\u00f3 a cabo por unos cuantos meses, y no se pudo terminar, \nElla se entera de Campo Alto, en el cual iba a realizar los estudios. Katherine indaga en internet, se comunica directamente con el instituto, le informan sobre el descuento que en esos momentos manejaban y se matriculo en el programa de mercadeo y ventas. \nEstudiar en campo alto es una puerta abierta no solo para el aprendizaje superior sino para la vida laboral, profesional y sobre todo para la vida personal y familiar. Retribuirle a la madre los a\u00f1os de dedicaci\u00f3n, esfuerzo para que este donde esta es una de las metas por cumplir, por ello lucha cada d\u00eda mas, para poder terminar lo que en este momento se encuentra realizando, dando paso a nuevas metas por cumplir, nuevos objetivos enfocados y las mejor actitud para aprender cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s.  \nElla ingresa a trabajar los fines de semana para tener ayuda econ\u00f3mica en el estudio, all\u00ed aprende a conocer personas, escuchar, observar, adem\u00e1s de trabajar all\u00ed e interactuar con la sociedad, con actitudes, totalmente diferentes a la suya ha sido una experiencia inolvidable para ella, adem\u00e1s con este trabajo se ha podido cancelar los dos semestres ya terminados en Campo Alto, en donde solo falta un semestre para finalizar, la meta pr\u00f3xima es realizar pr\u00e1cticas remuneradas, para terminar de pagar el estudio, colaborar a la madre, y continuar el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o con la carrera profesional, no solo esto, sino aprender cada d\u00eda mas, de las personas, hechos, actos y actitudes vistas y vividas, para ser cada d\u00eda mejor.\n\nComo ya menciono antes el convenio de kiva le ser\u00eda de gran ayuda, ya que ella misma es la que cancela el valor de las mensualidades y el trabajo es solo los fines de semana. \n","en":"This is Katherine, who is known for being a simple, direct, mature, charismatic, sensible, fragile, wise, hardworking, responsible, and committed person.\r\n\r\nShe was born on April 2nd.  After her parents got divorced, she and her mother moved to another city (where her family lives).  She started to work to support her daughter, who grew more every day.  During this time, one of her closest family members, her grandfather, died.  Fourteen months later, her uncle died and as a result they had to move to a different house.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, her mother had to leave her with friends so she could be taken care of.  At one point, they went without seeing each other for a full week due to work.  Despite these challenges, Katherine was always an excellent student and did well in school.  She also had goals, hopes, and dreams.\r\n\r\nStarting a career after 11th grade is everyone's dream.  What, where, and how much are the main questions that occupy the thoughts of every student who has only a few months left of high school left.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenient questions were what and how much, since she only had her mother to support her.  At this time, her mother didn't have work or a stable salary.  For this reason, El Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (Sena) was a good option.  In 10th grade she started a high school class with a contract with Sena.  She participated for a few months but wasn't able to finish.\r\n\r\nShe heard about Campo Alto and planned to do her schooling there.  Katherine looked it up online and communicated directly with the institute.  They told her about a scholarship that they had at the time and she started school there studying commerce and sales.\r\n\r\nStudying in Campo Alto has been a great opportunity not only due to the great education but also because of the work, professional, and above all personal and family life that she enjoyed.  One of the reasons she is where she is is because she wants to pay her mother back for her years of support.  For this reason, she keeps going every day and works to finish what she has started.  She always has new goals to meet, new objectives to focus on, and always has a good attitude about learning more every day.\r\n\r\nShe started working on the weekends so she could have financial help while studying.  There, she learned to get to know people, to listen, to observe, and also to work there and interact with people who had totally different attitudes than hers.  It has been an unforgettable experience for her.  In addition, with the help of this job, she has been able to pay for both semesters that she has spent at Campo Alto and she only has one semester left.  Her current goals include paying for her last semester, paying back her mother, and starting her professional career next year.  Not only this, but she wants to learn more every day about people, facts, actions, and attitudes seen and lived.  She wants to make every day better than the last.\r\n\r\nAs she already mentioned, before her payment is due, Kiva would be a great help.  She will make the monthly payments by working on the weekends."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1534341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay for another semester of school.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-25T05:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-27T05:10:11Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069866},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882823},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202188},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286329},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225036}],"funded_date":"2014-02-25T06:42:13Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":674924,"name":"Leofe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leofe has been working in her own farm to make a living.

hardworking man.  He is 48 years old, married, and has three wonderful children who deeply love and respect him. Murodjon and his family live in a rural village.  Murodjon's wife is a housekeeper and takes care of household business as well as helping Murodjon run the business he started in order to provide his family with a stable income.\r\n\r\nMurodjon and his children went into the business of selling dried fruits at the local bazaar where he has his own sales stall.   He does a good business, especially among the people in his village.  Everyone has to be ready for guests and to have on hand an assortment of treats, including dried fruits.  The majority of tourists also buy them because they are the essence of Tajikistan.  \r\n\r\nPresently Murodjon wants to buy a large quantity of assorted dried fruits at wholesale prices, but he doesn't have enough money.  Because of this he has applied to MDO Arvand and wants to take out a loan for the purchase of dried fruits.  Murodjon is really hoping for a positive response and wants to thank MDO Arvand for its support in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1531556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Burulkan is 38 years old, divorced, and is raising four daughters.  Her two eldest daughters are in school, the youngest two are still too young.  Burulkan has a secondary level education and her family's main income is the animal husbandry business she started 14 years ago with a purchase of 25,000 som (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Burulkan has three milk cows, two calves, and ten sheep.  Her father and brother, who live next door, help her with the business.  Her monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Burulkan applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy calves to increase the size of her herd.

She earns her income through animal husbandry, which she began 30 years ago when she bought cattle for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, she now has 9 dairy cows and a 0.33 hectare plot of land for planting potatoes, corn, and cotton. She earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to expand her farm, Bunazira applied for a loan with Bai-Tushum and Partners to buy cattle to fatten and resell.

Ainagul and her spouse have higher pedagogical educations. Both teach at a school, and have a lot of respect among the villagers, since they had graduated more than one generation of educated and talented students. As an additional source of income for their family, Ainagul and her husband raise livestock, having begun 14 years ago with a livestock purchase of 15,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Ainagul currently has on her homestead: five dairy cows, ten sheep, 12 goats, and two mares. The home has all the conditions for tending livestock. In the winter, the livestock are cared for at home, and with the start of spring are driven to the pastures until the end of autumn. There is a small irrigated area of land, where feed for the livestock prepares itself. Monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Ainagul applied to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan - to purchase steers for increasing her livestock count. <br \/><br \/>Ainagul plans to invest income from the loan in further propagating the quantity of domestic animals, and plans to save money to purchase a lot of land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1538119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Elmira has a secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Elmira raises livestock, having begun 15 years ago with a livestock purchase of 12,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Elmira currently has on her homestead: two dairy cows and 21 sheep. Monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Elmira applied to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan - to purchase a heifer for expanding her livestock count. <br \/><br \/>Elmira plans to invest income from the loan in further propagating the quantity of domestic livestock, and plans to save money for home

","en":"Jeniffer would like to tell a little bit about her life. She was living with her parents and was very spoiled. Everything that she wanted, her parents gave her. But when she became an adolescent, which is that most difficult age, she fell in love with a very nice young guy without knowing that he would cause a lot of pain in her family. She always supported this guy in everything he wanted, but she never received the same in return, so she decided to break up with him, but not before she ended up failing to complete tenth grade because of him.\r\n\r\nShe met another young guy who fell in love with her, and although he was from the country, she supported him. He started to work in the city and he came to visit her at home. They left to live together and she became pregnant at age 17. Her parents took it very badly, and they threw her out of the house. She left with the young guy, who never had left her alone in anything. After a few days, her parents allowed her to come back home with the young guy. And with the baby that was coming, her relationship with her parents improved. During that year she looked after herself and the baby, and on November 20, 2012 the joy of that home was born and everything began to return to normal. She studied to complete her high school degree, graduated, and started working. But with work she wasn\u2019t able to look after the baby, so she decided to stop working and return to being a caring and attentive mother to her son. She found work in a daycare, which she realized was something she was passionate about. She enrolled her son in the daycare so that she could look after him. \r\n\r\nHer parents supported her and she decided to study Comprehensive Early Childhood Care, thinking that she would start her own daycare or a foundation to support children with limited resources after she finished her studies.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan would be a great help, because it is difficult to pay the full tuition payments while she is also paying for the needs of her son. If she receives the Kiva loan, the amount of her tuition payments will be more affordable and she will be able to pay other expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1530342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-25T18:10:59Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-27T18:10:59Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeniffer ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069848},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882796},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202160},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286301},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":131845.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225008}],"funded_date":"2014-02-25T20:05:07Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":673756,"name":"Rosaura Liuvixa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Es una joven con iniciativa, soltera, tiene 18 a\u00f1os de edad.

The businesses of the members are varied and include spinning wool, making party favors, a convenience store, making empanadas and pastries, a bakery, spinning vicu\u00f1a wool (a llama-like animal), and knitting clothes from alpaca wool.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they are asking for will benefit small businesses including that of Lidia.  She says that she has been involved with Pro Mujer for 7 years following the invitation of a Pro Mujer worker who visited her at her home.  Currently, she has a business spinning vicu\u00f1a wool.  She learned this trade by observing her sister work.  After learning how to do it herself, she decided to start her own business.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is asking for will be used to increase her working capital by buying vicu\u00f1a wool wholesale.  She will buy the wool from La Paz suppliers and then sell it according to the demand of her customers.  By working in this way, she can make income to support her family.  She is married by common law and has one son.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the health benefits, the training, and the loans that the group offers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4300,"image":{"id":1535197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"buy

He is currently starting his fourth semester while completing this internship. He has been very responsible in all of his commitments, and he has done very well in his written tests. He also enjoys what he is learning.\r\n\r\nHis family includes five siblings, and he is the third. His mother, who is the head of household, has always supported him, which is why he is requesting the benefit of the Kiva program, so that he can finance his fourth semester on his own. Mario chose the Nursing Assistance Program because he is following his dream of becoming someone capable of helping the people who need it the most, and he is passionate about everything related to healthcare.\r\n\r\nHe has learned a lot during his time as an intern, and perhaps one of the most significant things he has learned is that life is the most important thing we have. By working with patients through their hospital stay, he has not only learned how to observe and carry out nursing duties, but also overcome his fear of public speaking and gained self-confidence. \r\n\r\nHis short-term goals in life are to earn his degree as a Nursing Assistant, move on to university, and put everything he has learned into practice. Mario's long-term goal is to study a specialty and do a doctorate, because he loves studying.\r\n\r\nRegarding his family life, Mario wants to support and guide his siblings. He wants to be a role model for them and to make his parents proud.
