She is the mother of 7 children, and lives in a traditional family in the Heremakono neighborhood, north of the city of Bougouni (in the third Administrative Region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nShe has been in the business of selling clothing for more than 10 years. Her experience in the domain earned her a good reputation, helping her get clothing orders. So in order to have the necessary resources to satisfy her customers, she is working with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She is now on her 9th loan, after having paid back her previous loans on time. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will enable her to buy 50 lengths of pagne [traditional cloth wrap].

With a population of roughly 5 million people it is by far the largest city in the country, and it also boasts the largest electrification rate. However this remains around 60%: this means that an estimated 2 million people living in the city have no access to the national grid.\n\nThis is a significant obstacle to economic development: shops have to close after sunset or use expensive (and sometimes very unhealthy) alternatives for lighting, such as small generators and kerosene, or battery-powered lanterns. For the hundreds of thousands of children living in Dar es Salaam's slums and poorer areas, it is impossible to study at night or do their homework.\n\nWith the help of African Solar Rise, Deo has opened a solar shop in Dar es Salaam, where he offers a sustainable alternative to his community. With his solar systems, they will be able to light their homes and shops at no extra cost for the next 5 years, thus increasing their income as well as their quality of life; their children will no longer have to read surrounded by kerosene smoke; and for some of them, this will be the opportunity to start a new business or expand an existing one by offering phone charging facilities.\n\nDeo's solar shop has been open for a month now and has already registered sales of over 10 systems. A loan from Kiva will help Deo purchase more solar systems at a wholesale price and on credit from African Solar Rise, making his business flourish. It will also give him the opportunity to make his shop better and invest in marketing activities - to reach more and more families in the area and give them access to electricity and light."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8000,"image":{"id":1538256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy solar systems for his Solar shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":309,"posted_date":"2014-02-25T22:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-27T22:40:08Z","loan_amount":8000,"lender_count":219,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deogratias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":8000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":8000,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-08-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-05T12:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696779778}],"funded_date":"2014-03-05T14:54:54Z","paid_date":"2015-09-05T12:10:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":675304,"name":"Kheang's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A rice farmer from Prey Veng province, Kheang, is a married father to four children.

This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family, since she is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the group work and the savings that the institution offers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1535237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-02-25T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-27T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sinforosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascuala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Gabrielina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27768,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3016.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3232.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3320.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3411.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3504.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3600.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3697.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3984.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":507.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":521.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":536},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":577.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":437.22,"local_amount":3016.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3021.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467924050},{"amount":468.59,"local_amount":3232.76,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3237.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144895},{"amount":481.38,"local_amount":3320.96,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3326.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838625},{"amount":494.49,"local_amount":3411.4,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3416.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264657},{"amount":1029.8,"local_amount":7104.48,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7115.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546761},{"amount":536,"local_amount":3697.84,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3703.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530029930},{"amount":577.52,"local_amount":3984.23,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3990.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522164}],"funded_date":"2014-02-28T19:57:03Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T13:18:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":673807,"name":"Francisco Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisco es originario de Camoapa, casado.

When he switches to the Teusaquillo campus that will become more complicated due to the increase that these transportation expenses mean for him.\r\n\r\nUpon finishing his program of studies, he hopes to specialize in advertising photography, turning himself into the best photographer in that format of communication.\r\n\r\nThe agreement with Kiva would be a huge help to him because he would be studying at a campus far from where he lives, so the transportation expenses and the monthly payments would increase a lot.  He is grateful if they can collaborate with him with the Kiva subsidy, because the amount of the charges on his monthly payments would be lower."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1535149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one semester's registration","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deivyd Duv\u00e1n ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":153704.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882825},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":153704.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202190},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":153704.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286331},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":153704.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225038}],"funded_date":"2014-02-26T03:04:39Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":675507,"name":"Danaya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe DANAYA est compos\u00e9 de femmes mari\u00e9es elles ont en moyenne 43 ans et 5 enfants.

He attended school until the third grade, because his family's finances did not allow him to continue his studies. However that hasn't prevented him from getting ahead. Providing for his large family's daily needs has entailed many difficulties, and he has worked hard with his wife to guarantee that his children don't lack for basic necessities. Jose works in agriculture, growing corn and beans. This job is done in the rainy season and in the summer his job is making artisanal tiles as a day laborer. The tiles are made with a mixture of clay and other types of earth, then the tiles are \"burned\" in ovens that they build themselves. Jose has worked for tile businesses since he was very young, and his father is the person that taught him the trade. It's one of the predominant economic activities in the area, and four of his children also work in tile manufacturing. The rest of his children are in school. With the loan he will purchase materials necessary for tile production, and this year has set the goal of setting up his own tile business and not have to depend on being hired. He will establish it with his children and they see a market for this type of business. Currently he doesn't have the necessary financial resources and that's why he has decided to request the loan. His dream is to really strengthen his tile business so he can have a guaranteed job that's sustainable in the long term, and thus guaranteeing support his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1519946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials necessary for making tiles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ndres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":31.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":32.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":34.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":31.67,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":31.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088652},{"amount":33.24,"local_amount":33.24,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":33.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902941},{"amount":34.15,"local_amount":34.15,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":34.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216133},{"amount":100.94,"local_amount":100.94,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817487}],"funded_date":"2014-02-26T06:32:23Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:36:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manolo Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":675432,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is 37 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nMercy works hard to provide for her family.

Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1494080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T04:40:03Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenepher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":144423,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144423}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1700,"local_amount":144423,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":146454.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723048}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T16:14:32Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":675434,"name":"Muhtasar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muhtasar was born in 1971.

This will meet a great need because winter is coming, which is a harsh time for her and her husband.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her house can have the features necessary for them to live in ideal conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1519952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"buy sand, cement, iron, and cement blocks so she can build two walls in her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Nelis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":37.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":47.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":52.14},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":53.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":63.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.14},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.15,"local_amount":61.15,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":61.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902931},{"amount":29.89,"local_amount":29.89,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":29.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216124},{"amount":36.91,"local_amount":36.91,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":36.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817479},{"amount":872.05,"local_amount":872.05,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":872.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504242921}],"funded_date":"2014-03-25T18:16:10Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:12:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Bales","image":1239603}},{"id":675444,"name":"Remia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remia is 39 years old and married with six children. \r\n\r\nShe earns a living by farming rice in the Philippines.

old and married.  She and her husband are raising three children.  Almakan has a secondary education and is involved in agriculture, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business 31 years ago with an initial capital of 5,000 som (KGS) and she is now an experienced farmer.  Thanks to many years of hard work, she currently owns 1.5 hectare  (3.7 acres) of land on which she grows beans and corn annually, for domestic use as well as for resale.  She makes a monthly income of 12,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nEager to further develop her farming business, Almakan has turned to the Bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan to buy bean seeds for sowing, and fertilizers to prepare the soil.  She plans to use the earnings from her loan to buy some livestock.  In the future, she would like to expand her activity and get involved in animal husbandry.  She is also planning to save enough money to buy some home

She and her husband have three children, two of whom are currently working in Russia as migrant workers and helping their parents financially.  Kimiyakan has a secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business 14 years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to years of hard work, she now owns 25 sheep and three goats.

Alice has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 79 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. <br \/><br \/>Alice is married and has eight children. She is 60 years old and is known as hardworking. She is active in her community in groups such as the prayer group. Alice has been a farmer for 37 years.  Alice described her harvest as good last year but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.   <br \/><br \/>Alice first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Alice joined One Acre Fund in order to earn enough to feed her family.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member. Alice plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Alice\u2019s own life improved because she was able to save money.<br \/><br \/>Alice and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. <br \/><br \/>The field officer is also included in the

His parents unfortunately couldn't help him so that he could study, since they had a lot of needs, and on top of that, the closest school was more than three kilometers from his house, which made the situation even more difficult.Today he is married, and his wife takes charge of doing the household work. They have five children, of which two have finished high school and two more are still in school. \r\n\r\nCarlos began working in agriculture at the age of 14 alongside his father and brothers. He learned everything about growing corn and beans, which he continues to do, thanks to his father, who taught him to be a honest and responsible person. At the age of 20 he decided to get married, to the woman who is now his wife and with whom he has five children. They sow together 28,000 square meters of corn and beans, and this work ensures their income for the following year, thanks to the produce that results at the end of each growing period. His workday begins at 5:00 AM every day. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy two oxen, with which he plans to begin working this year, to prepare the 28,000 square meters that produce his crop every year. And he will also have a new source of income, since he will be able to hire them out to other farmers in the area. \r\n\r\nCarlos and his wife dream of starting a little store out of their house. That way they wouldn't be directly dependent only on agriculture. Also, like all parents, he had the intention of helping his children to study higher education, but unfortunately their income has not been enough. He has faith that soon, if this year's yield is good, the following year he can send his children to school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1520794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two oxen","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T07:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T07:40:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216643},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545739}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T23:51:47Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Meravi","image":1279777}},{"id":663627,"name":"Sandra Elisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sandra de 39 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta s\u00e9ptimo grado, dej\u00f3 la escuela porque se cas\u00f3, su esposo se dedica a la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, tiene 4 hijos, uno ya est\u00e1 casado y los otros 3 estudian en la escuela, y nadie mas vive con ellos. \n\n Sandra trabaja como cocinera en una iglesia donde atiende a ni\u00f1os, que asisten a reforzar sus conocimientos educativos, tiene 2 a\u00f1os de desempe\u00f1ar este trabajo. pero desde que ten\u00eda 11 a\u00f1os se dedica a vender frutas, tamales, ropa, ya que ten\u00eda 7 a\u00f1os cuando muri\u00f3 su padre y su madre, la mandaba a vender para sacar adelante a sus hermanos, y vend\u00eda en los caser\u00edos vecinos.

He has no education, because his parents were of low income and they had the idea that education wasn't useful for anything and the only useful thing is work. He is married and his wife is a homemaker. All of his children are married so his only dependent is his wife.\r\n\r\nRight now, he grows corn and beans. He has done this since he was a child because his father would have him in the fields so that he would learn the trade. He has to go from one canton to another and has to travel approximately 3 kilometers to get to the cornfield. In addition, he is an evangelical pastor  and has been leading a church for 19 years. He gets up very early to go to work in the cornfield and later from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. he is at the church with his wife. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in making a new church building. The place where the church is now is made from adobe and it is also very small. Every day more people visit. It is also work noting that it isn't very safe because it was built several years ago.  \r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have a better house than the one he has now and to be able to have a vehicle to go to church in with his wife, because they are both elderly. He also dreams of finishing the church building, which is the best inheritance he can leave his brothers in Christ.

He started working in agriculture 20 years ago, when he decided to leave home, start his family and focus on his agricultural work.  He learned how to do this work from his father.  \r\n\r\nWilfredo also has another source of income in his home, which is a mill.  In the region, there are very few mills, and many people had to travel very far to do their grinding.  Seeing this, he decided to open one so that he could have the additional income for his family.  Where he does his agricultural work is about 35 minutes away from his home.  He travels there on foot, and does so only with his helpers as his wife stays at home working the mill, and his son goes to school.  \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, he will harvest his crops to prepare them and bring them home.  The loan will help him a lot as he currently does not have the finances to pay people to help him harvest his crops, and to pay for the machinery that shucks the corn so he can have it ready to use at home and to sell in the market.  \r\n\r\nHis dreams are to be able to continue growing his crops so that he will never be without corn in their house, to have an income for his family, and to be able to put his son in college.  With his earnings, he wants to repair the building where his mill is in so that the people who come to use it can avoid the sun in the summer, and do not get wet during the rainy season.

He is pictured here in a group of 8 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 81 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  George has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGeorge is married and has 8 children.  He is 60 years old and is known as friendly and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and burial committee.  George has been a farmer for 20 years.  George described his harvest as poor last year, but believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGeorge first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  George joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and get new farming methods. George plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  George\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from the harvest and has more farming training. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nGeorge and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from the One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5050,"image":{"id":1494974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to allow him the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seed.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T15:20:05Z","loan_amount":5050,"lender_count":192,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bredsian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Walter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Electine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":433269,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433269}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5050,"local_amount":433269,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":435057.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723056}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T00:54:14Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":675572,"name":"Abisaki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abisaki is a 40-year-old lady from Kakamega county who is married to Christopher, a civil servant.

She is married, and her husband works construction.  All of her children are already married, and they no longer depend on her.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Dinora is a seamstress, and she has many customers in her community.  She learned this craft as a young girl, since her mother also worked as a seamstress.  She realized that it was a good career that would allow her to support herself and her household.  She also has a mill, which she was able to purchase after a lot of effort.  The mill allows her to earn extra money for her expenses.  Since the business is in her home, she does not have a fixed schedule.  She wakes up very early to tend to the mill, make breakfast so that her husband can leave for work, and attend to her tailoring customers that come to the house.  \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase a refrigerator, as she is planning on opening a store because many people come for the mill, and she thinks that she would be able to sell a lot of products.

He is pictured here in a group of three One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 37 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Godfrey has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. (The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.) Godfrey and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for growing \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nGodfrey is married and has 10 children.  He is 47 years old and is known as hardworking.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group.  Godfrey has been a farmer for 10 years.  He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nGodfrey first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Godfrey joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  Godfrey plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Godfrey\u2019s own life has improved because he was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nGodfrey and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 74 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Okumu is pictured on the right of the group with his hand raised. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOkumu is 49 years old and has been a farmer for 30 years. Okumu works as a farmer to provide for his 9 children. The community and other farmers know Okumu as a reliable experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the men's group and the burial committee.\t\t\r\n\r\nOkumu is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Okumu joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Okumu plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and repair his home. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Okumu\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest and was able to feed his family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOkumu and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.

He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nJohn plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his child to school.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. John\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and was able to feed the family.  \r\n\r\nJohn and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1496990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":139074,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139074}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1625,"local_amount":139074,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":139993.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723050}],"funded_date":"2014-03-04T15:59:12Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":675576,"name":"Nasreen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Nasreen is a 37-year-old married woman.

The only source of the family's income is Bela's husband's job. He works as an artisan on private orders that generate 300 GEL per month. As you notice, this salary is hardly enough to meet all their basic needs and household expenses, so the family lives in poverty. For lack of economic resources, Bela was unable to learn a professional career. That's why she can't find any stable job. \r\n\r\nBela decided to start her own business and requested a loan. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. Bela received the loan for repairing the place and to purchase raw materials for opening a cafe. She will serve clients herself and will get regular customers for good food and good service. The loan will greatly assist Bela and she will be able to improve her economic situation and give her family a better style of life.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.

He is 46-years-old and is known as a reliable and trustworthy farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group.  Edward has been a farmer for 18 years.  Edward described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEdward first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Edward joined One Acre Fund in order to get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed family. Edward plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Edward\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest and was able to save money to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEdward and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1494969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T15:50:04Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":288846,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288846}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3375,"local_amount":288846,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":290756.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723057}],"funded_date":"2014-03-27T19:46:25Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":675562,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricia is 50 years old and lives in Dansoman-Accra with her husband and her two children.

The group leaders represent a total of 30 individual OAF farmers who are not pictured here. Rosemary has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nRosemary is 40 years old and has been a farmer for 25 years. She works as a farmer to provide for her 11 children. The community and other farmers know Rosemary as hardworking and trustworthy. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community in the women's group and the savings group. Rosemary described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of OAF and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nRosemary first enrolled with One Acre Fund (OAF) in 2011 and is now preparing to be a OAF farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. She joined OAF in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods and obtain fertilizer and hybrid seeds. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member and wants to spread the story about OAF farmers. Rosemary plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and to save for the future. She notes that working with OAF has led to many benefits for OAF farmers. Rosemary\u2019s own life has improved because she now has more profits from the harvest and has been able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nRosemary and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund (OAF). OAF will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. OAF pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, OAF also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to them. With support from OAF and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1494965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":160470,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160470}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1875,"local_amount":160470,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":161531.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723058}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T00:02:32Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":675593,"name":"Isaac","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isaac is 30 years old from Nakuru.

This group consists of eight members and is led by a Board of Directors in which Sra. Yolanda is the president.  The members of the Communal Bank engage in different businesses such as selling sweaters, selling \u201capi\u201d (a traditional beverage made from corn), weaving blankets, providing construction services, selling clothes, and selling shampoo.<br \/><br \/>This loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Yolanda.  She says that this is the first time she has joined Pro Mujer after receiving an invitation from a promoter of the organization who visited her at her house.  Yolanda currently has a business in which she provides construction services.  She has gained knowledge about this business since starting it so that she could help her husband with his work.  Yoland eventually learned construction techniques, so she decided to work with him.  <br \/><br \/>The loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying construction tools.  She will acquire them at the distribution stores in the city of El Alto and then put them to use at her workplace.  By working in this manner, Yolanda is able to generate income for supporting her family.  She is married and has two children.  <br \/><br \/>When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Yolanda said that she enjoys the loans and the training seminars offered by the organization."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1534375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicky Flory\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beltran","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16480,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3024},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3200.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3278},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3384.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3592.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":466.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":523.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":440.39,"local_amount":3024,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3042.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467924043},{"amount":466.11,"local_amount":3200.64,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3220.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144888},{"amount":970.25,"local_amount":6662.4,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6704.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838618},{"amount":523.25,"local_amount":3592.96,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3615.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264650}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T13:10:46Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T13:17:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":675587,"name":"Wasef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wasef is 19 years old and lives in Gaza.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.

Martin works as a farmer to provide for his ten children. The community and other farmers know Martin as friendly, hard-working, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community, in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Martin described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Martin\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.

As an active member in his community, Martin also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nMartin plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money, and can feed the family.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMartin and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved

as the Kiva representative.  Francis has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 95 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFrancis is married and has 9 children.  He is 53 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Francis has been a farmer for 23 years.  Francis described his harvest as not with One Acre Fund last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFrancis first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Francis joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, send children to school and earn enough to feed his family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Francis plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a goat.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Francis\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and was able to feed the family. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFrancis and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5900,"image":{"id":1494957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":5900,"lender_count":193,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Almelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilkister","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":508155,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":508155}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5900,"local_amount":508155,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":508284.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723060}],"funded_date":"2014-03-28T04:11:50Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":664674,"name":"Oscar Anibal","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar de 30 a\u00f1os de edad,  estudio hasta noveno grado, esta acompa\u00f1ado y su esposa trabaja de ama de casa y actualmente cuida dos ni\u00f1os los cuales son sus hijos que est\u00e1n peque\u00f1os todos ellos dependen de el.\n\n\n\u00c9l es empleado ya tiene cinco a\u00f1os de trabajar en una empresa el\u00e9ctrica,su trabajo le queda bien cerca su horario es de 6 am a 4:30 pm.\n\n\n El pr\u00e9stamo mejorara su vida porque le permitir\u00e1 terminar de construir su vivienda, comprara lamina antes que empiece el invierno la necesidad quedara cubierta porque tendr\u00e1 su casa terminada.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o es seguir mejorando su casa, y que su familia viva en mejores condiciones y lograra su objetivo con la ayuda de Dios y seguir trabajando con credicampo.\n","en":"Oscar, 30, studied until the 9th grade.

He is pictured here in a group of seven One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  (The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.) The group leaders represent a total of 70 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Patrick  has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for growing \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatrick  is married and has five children.  He is 36 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Patrick  has been a farmer for 12 years.  He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPatrick  first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Patrick  joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, send his children to school and earn enough to feed his family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nPatrick  plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Patrick \u2019s own life has improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nPatrick  and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.

Emilie, in order to avoid public buses disturbance, bought a business car. She managed to earn a profit, which she used to build a house, buy house furniture and an electric stove. She dreams of opening a poultry business. \n\nShe will share this loan with her loan group, \"Sabasaba\", which totals two members.

She is pictured here in a group of four One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 50 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Beatrice has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBeatrice is 50 years old and has been a farmer for 28 years.  Beatrice works as a farmer to provide for her five children.  The community and other farmers know Beatrice as friendly, hardworking and trustworthy.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group and prayer group.  Beatrice described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBeatrice joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Beatrice joined One Acre Fund so that she could earn enough to feed her family.  Because she is an active community member, Beatrice wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Beatrice has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Beatrice's life because she has more farm training and was able to feed her family.  In the future, Beatrice hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Beatrice and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":1494952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase better harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete-","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T19:00:06Z","loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":267450,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3125,"local_amount":267450,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":269218.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723062}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T06:58:33Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":671848,"name":"Gorden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gorden thanks the Kiva lenders for the support they accorded him during his previous loan.\r\n\r\nGorden also deals in cattle trade and cattle fattening to supplement his income.

He also works on Saturday mornings.\r\n\r\nFrancisco will use this loan to buy pipes, cement, sand and bricks and to pay labourers as, during the winter, the pipes were damaged as they were not big enough to remove all the rainfall. This resulted in rainwater coming into the house when it was falling heavily. This loan will allow Francisco to install larger pipes. He also has to remove parts of the floor to lay down the pipes, and connect them to the city's water system. Francisco needs to do this in order to have a safe home for his family.\r\n\r\nFrancisco dreams of giving his children a secure house so that they can live in good conditions. He wants to support them in their education so that they can have a better future as a result of university studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1523956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He is pictured here in a group of 6 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 75 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Christopher has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nChristopher is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 6 children.  Christopher is 42 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 20 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Christopher is very active in his community and is involved in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue with the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nChristopher joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Christopher joined One Acre Fund so that he could get new farming methods, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  Because he is an active community member, Christopher wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Christopher has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Christopher's life because he has more farm training, has more farm group support and was able to feed the family.  In the future, Christopher hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nChristopher and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included

He is married and has five children. His oldest daughter lives with her partner, two of his children are in school, and the other two are working.\r\n\r\nHe has worked as a farmer ever since he was very young. He learned from his parents, who were also farmers. Pedro farms 1.7 acres of land that produce an average of 3,000 kg of corn. He also owns a mill where his wife works, which allows them to make extra income. His farmwork schedule is from 6:00 am to 12:00 pm and his land is ten minutes away from his home. \r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will allow him to prepare the last crop that was harvested and store it so that it doesn't suffer any damage. He will also use the money to pay rent on the land he uses and start preparing now for this year's harvest in 2014.
