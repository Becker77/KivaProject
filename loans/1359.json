Obed described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nObed first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Obed joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  Obed plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.

Currently he struggles day by day to give his children the financial means and achieve every father's dream of educating them to become professionals. Thanks to his efforts and desire to advance, Acencion works selling sorbets and ice creams in different flavors as a street vendor. He works about ten hours every day offering his product. He will use this loan to invest it in working capital and stock up in ice cream, so that he can earn more income. Acencion is thankful to the Kiva lenders for the help they give to persons of scarce resources and poor countries such as Nicaragua so they can have a worthy job.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1532188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to invest in working capital and to stock up his cart with ice cream of different flavors.

He works alone, from 6:00 a.m. to 12 noon. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is for the purchase of a calf, with which he will be able to improve his assets, increase production, have more income for his home, and take a step toward developing himself and his family.\r\n\r\nHis wish is that his children grow up with an education, and that he will be able to support them through the sacrifices that he is making in order to keep them in school. He hopes that they will prepare themselves, so that one day they will be the ones who help him in his old age.

She was able to complete 5th grade, but left school because poverty made her move to the capital and work as a housekeeper in other people's homes for 12 years. She's married, and her husband works in agriculture and sells tiles. Her four children live with her and attend school.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she makes tiles and helps her husband with the farm work during rainy season. Aside from that, she does household chores. Selling tiles is a family business and they work on it from December through April (dry season).\r\n\r\nThey manufacture the tiles on a plot of land that they rent every year. It's located four blocks away from their home. They start working at 3 a.m. and finish by 11 a.m. Then at 3 p.m. they go and pick up all the tiles they made in the morning.\r\n\r\nShe'll use the loan to invest in purchasing supplies (white adobe, mud and firewood) and also in paying the rent on the land where they work. She needs to have working capital in order to get started. Later on, with their production and subsequent sales, they'll keep on working with nonstop production. With the loan she'll be able to seize the opportunity to improve her profits, because it's a good time for that.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her children continue their studies and have the possibility to go to college, get trained and become professionals.

selected as the Kiva representative.  Vincent has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 72 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nVincent is married and has 4 children.  He is 61 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Vincent has been a farmer for 7 years.  Vincent harvest was not with One Acre Fund last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season will be Vincent\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He joined this year in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family, and send his children to school.  As an active member in his community, Vincent also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers, and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Vincent plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Vincent and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":1494199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":4475,"lender_count":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kizito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Immaculate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":385128,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385128}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4475,"local_amount":385128,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":385520.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723066}],"funded_date":"2014-03-26T02:40:01Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":665530,"name":"Berfalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Berfalia de 39 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta s\u00e9ptimo grado, no est\u00e1 casada y tiene tres hijos, uno de ellos trabaja adiestrando caballos, su hija ya se cas\u00f3 y solo depende de ella su hijo menor, que actualmente, se encuentra estudiando bachillerato.\n\nElla se dedica al destazo, lo hace todos los martes de cada semana, tiene tres a\u00f1os de dedicarse a esta actividad, pues fue de su madre quien aprendi\u00f3 este trabajo, con el tiempo le fue gustando y es por ello que decidi\u00f3 dedicarse a este negocio y porque adem\u00e1s, le genera buenos ingresos.

At age 15, he emigrated to the United States of America, where he works very hard for 10 years so he could help his family. Thanks to his efforts, soon he was able to build his own house.

She sells corn tortillas in the community.\r\n\r\nReinaldo works in masonry. His father and some of his local friends helped him, and thus he successfully learned and became self-employed. In addition, he sells iron, because in the area where he lives there are small shops that manufacture sickles and he sells the iron. He also makes sickles alongside his father six days a week, beginning at 3:30 a.m., so he can sell them in town. His father helps him in this line of work.\r\n\r\nReinaldo also works in agriculture (he grows corn and beans) and raises cattle on a small scale. This was taught to him by his parents, because they own a small herd of cattle.\r\n\r\nReinaldo is requesting a loan from CrediCampo so he can purchase a dairy cow which is valued at U$ 600.00. He'll buy it in his community.\r\nHe'll also purchase 20 quintals of iron which are valued at U$ 40.00 each. He'll be able to sell them in the community, because the upcoming season is the one when iron sales are highest, since people from that area and from neighboring areas are getting ready to sow their crops.\r\nHe dreams of having plenty of health so he can provide the best for his son and his wife.

He is active in his community, in groups such as the men's group, prayer group, and burial committee. Calisto has been a farmer for 20 years. He was not with One Acre Fund last year, but believes he can have an even better harvest this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season will be Calisto\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He joined this year in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough money to feed his family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, Calisto also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nCalisto plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, and buy a pig.  He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money, and feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nCalisto and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":1494171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T22:50:04Z","loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Calisto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":310242,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":310242}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3625,"local_amount":310242,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":312293.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723067}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T11:53:24Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":675720,"name":"Kyamukube Bakyara Nabasaija Tweyimukye Group.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is a hardworking woman living in Fort Portal, Uganda where she has been dealing in fresh food and produce selling since 2009 to support her family.

She is a single mother; her husband left her when her son was six years old.  With a lot of dedication, she is raising her child and he is now starting at university.\r\n\r\nYanira has been a health worker for 20 years.  She got her job thanks to a friend of her father.  She officially works eight hours a day but in reality it is more because sometimes she has to stay with her patients at night.  However, she says that she enjoys doing it because it gives her great satisfaction to be helping people, no matter what time it is.  Besides this, at times she has to walk for up to eight hours when she has to give vaccines to children or attend to pregnant women.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan in making a down payment at the university and settling the rent where her son is going to stay.  He has to stay there because the university is a long way away and he cannot commute every day.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her son become an excellent doctor, which is his chosen area of study.  She gives him her unconditional support because she always wanted to be a nurse herself, a goal she was unable to achieve.  She would also like to buy a house nearer the university so they don\u2019t have to travel so far to see each other.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1527386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to pay for university studies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-26T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-28T23:10:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yanira Emperatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":77.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":94.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105.03,"local_amount":105.03,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T10:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459088789},{"amount":77.99,"local_amount":77.99,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":77.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903061},{"amount":77.04,"local_amount":77.04,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":77.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216241},{"amount":80.08,"local_amount":80.08,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817598},{"amount":83.07,"local_amount":83.07,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":83.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243743},{"amount":576.79,"local_amount":576.79,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":576.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526119}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T01:22:50Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:17:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":675749,"name":"Loise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loise lives in the Homa Bay area of Kenya.

His mother was very poor and had money only for food since there were five children.\r\n\r\nHe has a partner and his wife sells torillas and dairy products. They have three children, one of whom has a partner while the other two are currently in school and still dependent on him.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has been a farmer since he was 18 years old. He learned the work with some friends. In addition another friend taught him how to drive a truck and that has been very handy since that is how he has earned his daily bread.

Economic resources were scarce and she was one of the oldest daughters, so she had to help her parents work in the home as well as in the fields. She is married, but her husband lives elsewhere. Only her three children live with her, in addition to her mother. She works selling tamarind and carao fruits, since she has some of these trees at her house and when she doesn't get much from her harvest, she buys from her neighbors. She learned this work from her mother, because ever since she was little, her mother took her to the market. Previously, she and her husband worked together in agriculture. But because sowing went badly for them and they had losses, her husband decided to emigrate to the United States. She sells in the market in the mornings, and in the afternoons she returns to do the housework. This loan will help Luisa to build a room, since her house is very small and her children are older now. She will also build a wall in front of her house. The money she has is not enough, and with the loan she will have what she needs.

He has a partner and his wife works selling curd. They have two children and both have partners. No-one is dependent on them and they live alone in their house.\r\n\r\nHe has been a farmer since he was 12 years old. He learned the work from his father who also taught him bricklaying. He also enjoys caring for cattle since his father always had cows in their home.\r\n\r\nHis daily routine begins at 4 a.m. when he milks the cows. Then he drinks a cup of coffee and takes all of his cattle to pasture. He remains working in his corn fields. He has to make a long trip on foot of about 30 minutes. He works approximtley six hours in the fields and then returns home for lunch. In the afternoon he feeds the cattle so they will give more milk, since it is from that product that he makes a living.\r\n\r\nMiguel needs this loan and hopes to invest part in the purchase of another cow and the rest in the rent on pasture land for his cattle. The loan will also cover the rent for land.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to purchase land, so that his children have a place to build their houses since where they live now is remote, and to purchase another five milk cows and thus achieve economic stability. He expects to be able to pay off the loan with the profits from his milk sales.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1527371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

village in Vihiga, Kenya. Josphert is a friendly, goal oriented and hardworking member of the community with 6 children. Josphert lives with them in a house made of mud walls, sand floor and grass roof.\n\nMuyundi village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Josphert and the 20 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nJosphert has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Josphert volunteered to be the promoter because he is trusted by the community and he wants to help his community prevent diarrhea. There is also another volunteer promoter, Florence, from the surrounding community who is part of this group loan.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Josphert\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1527095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josphert ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T06:38:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":675808,"name":"Jessica Camila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jessica, 23, is married and lives with her parents and a brother.

Also, he has worked with 'mototaxis\u2019 [three-wheeled motorized vehicles] for four years.  He also saw that this was a good business.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, Jos\u00e9 has always worked in agriculture.  His children help him with his work once in a while.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 needs this loan to buy some furniture for his house and to repair the mill and the mototaxi.\r\n\r\nHe also dreams of remodeling his house in the future.  He wishes to see it in better condition.  If possible, he wants to buy more mototaxis in order to increase the service that he provides the community where he lives.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1528020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy some furniture for his house and to repair the mill and the mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T01:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T01:20:06Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Amilcar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1310,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1310}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":673787,"name":"Las Estrellitas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cLAS ESTRELLITAS\u201d es un grupo conformada por personas empe\u00f1osas a mejorar la calidad de sus familias.

","en":"Amilcar is 48 years old and only has a first grade education.  Due to his family's financial situation and because of armed conflict, his father did not want him to go to school because he was afraid the guerrillas would take him.  For this reason, he had to quit school.  <br \/><br \/>Amilcar is in a relationship and his partner takes care of the household duties.  They have a son who is already in a relationship.  The only person living with them is a granddaughter.  <br \/><br \/>Amilcar has been farming since the age of 10 since it was his father who taught him how to work.  However, for the past 20 years, he has worked as a handler at a stable out of necessity because he needed to support his family.  Prior to working as a farm hand, Amilcar served in the military for six years.  <br \/><br \/>His day begins at 3:00 A.M. since he must milk the cows before the product is delivered at 7:30 A.M.  Afterwards, the cows are taken out to pasture and he continues to look after them until 1:00 P.M.  He returns home to have lunch before rounding up the cows at 4:00 P.M.  This is his daily routine.  <br \/><br \/>The loan he is requesting will be used to buy a calf since he dreams of having his own cattle.  Amilcar would also like to build a house for his son who is living abroad.  In addition, he would like to have 10 dairy cows.  This loan will help him to start fulfilling those dreams with the purchase of a calf.  With his earnings, he expects to repay the loan from CrediCampo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1520738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T01:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T01:30:08Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amilcar Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":475,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":475,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420864}],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T04:55:26Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":675913,"name":"Daisy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daisy joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative in the year 2009 and she appreciates the programs, services and continuous education of the co-op.

She was raised by an aunt and not given the opportunity to go to school because she wasn't her aunt's own child.  She only worked very hard from a young age to get her food.  Now she's married and has three children.  Two of them live with her and attend school; her oldest son lives in another city.  Her husband works in the canals and helps Mar\u00eda economically.\r\n\r\nCurrently Mar\u00eda makes a living selling fruits and vegetables, work she has done since she was a little girl.  Back then she had to do everything she could to work at something, and now this is helping her support her family.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda gets up very early to go to the market and shop.  Then she has to walk to the nearby cantons to sell her products.  She doesn't stop working, because she doesn't go home to take care of her children until she sells all her merchandise.  Sometimes Mar\u00eda's daughter goes with her if she doesn't go to school.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's requesting this loan to build a room, because her house is very small.  She also wants to invest in her business by paying someone to help her.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to have a decent house to live in with her children and grandchildren, and be able to give them an education, something she, unfortunately, wasn't able to have.  She also wants to get a stall in the market so she won't have to walk so much.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda trusts in God that this loan will help her get ahead.  It's a big effort, but the only way she'll have a better financial situation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1527993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to build a room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T02:30:06Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Orphan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":42.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":46.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.28,"local_amount":38.28,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":38.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903067},{"amount":36.44,"local_amount":36.44,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":36.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216247},{"amount":37.52,"local_amount":37.52,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":37.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817604},{"amount":39.26,"local_amount":39.26,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":39.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243010},{"amount":40.39,"local_amount":40.39,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":40.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526124},{"amount":129.36,"local_amount":129.36,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":129.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008583},{"amount":478.75,"local_amount":478.75,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":478.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500657}],"funded_date":"2014-03-26T02:47:08Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:30:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":675934,"name":"Jubie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jubie is 39 years old and lives in Nacional, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

She works at domestic chores, but also works in agriculture with her husband.  She also takes care of the chickens when she returns from the fields.  Her father taught her agriculture from a very young age.  She now wants to devote herself full-time to buying and raising chickens, because it is a source of income that she can obtain when she sells them, and in this way can help her husband to support the household.  With the loan requested she will help her husband to harvest the crops, and with the rest she will buy more chickens, and try to have a bigger farm to keep them on.  The loan will improve her life greatly, because in addition to bringing in harvest and storing them in the house, she will have the opportunity to have her own farm in the future.

He and his family live in a small house in a rural village.  He's hale, hearty and works hard to provide for his family.  He grows crops and raises cattle for a living.  He has a 12-hectare plot of land; 8 hectares don't have irrigation systems, while the other 4 do.  He grows carrots, potatoes and grain crops on his land, and his wife helps him tend the cattle.  As their plot of land is large, they graze their cattle on it as well. His cattle business brings in a good amount of money.  Zafar also earns money on the side as a taxi driver; a trade he plies with his very own car.\r\n    \r\nHis oldest kids are already adults and have their own families, while his youngest daughter still lives with him.  Zafar hopes to see her married soon, just as her brothers and sisters are.  It's a very important event not only for her, but for the whole family as well, and it takes a lot of careful preparation.  He wants to provide a dowry for her wedding, but doesn't have enough money to buy everything necessary to do so.  For this reason, he's turned to Arvand for a loan to pay for his daughter's wedding dowry, and would like to thank them in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1530221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

","en":"Oksana is 34 years old and married.  In spite of her young age, she is already the mother of five children, whom she raises with her husband, named Nabrek. She has a secondary education.  She graduated from high school in 1996 and got married the same year. Oksana and Nabrek got involved in animal husbandry together, after buying their first livestock for 16,000 som (KGS).  After years of hard work, Oksana now owns five dairy cows, three calves and one foal.  Her husband and children help her around the farm.  In the winter, Oksana keeps her livestock on the farm where she has a heated barn.  In the summer she sends her livestock to graze in the pastures, with a shepherd.  Oksana and her family own 0.64 hectare of land on which they grow clover to feed their animals.  They also buy additional fodder.  Every month they make 16,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk.\r\n\r\nEager to further develop her farming business, Oksana has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan.  She will use her loan to buy some young bulls and increase her cattle headcount.  She is planning to reinvest the earnings form her loan into further increasing her number of farm animals.  She is also planning to save enough money to pay for her children's education.

He is married, and his wife takes care of the household. They have a daughter and their family is just the three of them. Sandro likes to work and has had a car-painting workshop for eight years. When he finished his studies, he took a good look at the difficult situation in the country, saw that he could not find a job, and decided to start his own business in his house. This is his only activity. He took one year to learn the trade in a workshop, and now he has his own and only hires help when there are more cars than he can paint on his own. He works from 7 am to 5 pm. He asks for a loan to pay outstanding loans to another financial institution, which he feels practices prohibitive interest rates. He will use his income from the workshop to repay the Kiva loan. He also intends to invest in his business by buying more paint wholesale and improving the workspace in order to have a better workplace environment. He dreams of his workshop becoming well-known in the region, and already has many customers. He also wishes to expand his workshop in order to be able to help other people by giving them a job and to improve his family's standard of living."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1530397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to pay outstanding loans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T09:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T09:20:02Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandro Ernesto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":62.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":65.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":69.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":74.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":77.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":79.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":82.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":88.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":94.99},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":107.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":675996,"name":"Gracelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of four children, Gracelia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fish vending business in the Philippines and earns additional income from her general store.

She is in her early forties and a married woman. For three years now, Elizabeth has had a business selling second-hand clothes and fabrics. Her business is showing a good viability but she does not have enough capital to improve. She operates her business from 10am to 6pm daily and is able to make a fair monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loan to buy stocks of clothes. Elizabeth managed to pay back her entire loan. She manage to earn an extra income which she used to pay school fees and home food expenses. She also saved a portion. \r\n\r\nElizabeth will use this loan to buy new stocks of second-hand clothes and fabrics to resell.

Jaime se encarga de distribuir en la bicicleta, los tamales que hace su espossa, pues ella padece de una enfermedad y la operaron recientemente, su estado le impide salir a vender los tamales.

He is married and his wife makes chicken and red bean tamales.  They have three daughters who, through hard work, were able to get a high school education.  His mother also lives with the family.\r\n\r\nJaime has a small bakery business.  He learned he trade when he was 17 and his brother got him a job at the bakery where he worked.  Jaime delivers his goods and the tamales his wife makes by bicycle.  His wife is ill and had an operation recently, so she is unable to go out and sell the tamales.  Jaime's daughter and sister-in-law help in the business.  He goes out on his bike at 5:00 a.m. to sell throughout the village.  In the morning he sells chicken tamales and in the afternoons he sells the red bean tamales.  All of his customers love the products because they are a national tradition.\r\n\r\nSince Jaime also has his bakery business he is requesting a loan to buy supplies: flour, sugar, shortening, trays, etc. and a table to display the products.  This will be helpful for him because he already has an oven for the bakery, and most importantly, already has experience in the business.\r\n\r\nJaime has many goals in life.  He wants to be a good baker and buy an oven with much more capacity.  He also wants to buy a motorcycle to sell bread, so it is easier to go out to sell.  Another goal is to renovate his house to make it more comfortable.  He says he can achieve all of this through much effort and the support of the loans, so he is very grateful to the

She hopes this loan will enable her to fatten her pigs and grow more crops so as to make a better living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1538219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers and gasoline for pumping water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham Province, Koh Sotin District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T14:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T14:50:15Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokngi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3087649.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542684450}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T17:21:05Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T18:36:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":671416,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase corn and wood to make tortillas, and finish paying for the deeds of some land that she had acquired.

As the business is in her house she has time to attend to her family and the business.  She learned to do this work as she had to come out ahead with household expenses. Her husband\u2019s income was very little and so she decided to look for a way to obtain extra income to contribute to her home.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to build a house of adobe for her son as he wants to become independent. She will provide a little bit of help with the loan so that he can fulfil his dream of having his own house. The client\u2019s life as well as her son\u2019s would extremely change as she would have the satisfaction that she helped him build his dream. With the loan, he could start building his house before winter arrives and not have any problems of it getting wet.\r\n,\r\nIn the future the client wishes to see her son\u2019s dream of having his own house fulfilled as well as her satisfaction of seeing it completed. She wants her income from the shop to continue to grow, to expand the shop and to try to bring all the products that her clients want to buy.

She only studied until the second grade due to her parents living in poverty. She is married and her husband works in the mayor's office. They have four children; three of whom are in relationships and just one child lives with them. She has been selling tortillas for two years. It was out of necessity that she tried this business. The woman who used to sell at this stand left her business. She suggested that Maria take it over and so her business was started. Before she began working in the business of selling tortillas, she worked daily as a farm worker. Her father taught her how to work in the fields. \r\n\r\nShe usually wakes up at 4:00 A.M. to sow the corn and carry it to the mill before beginning to make tortillas at 8:30 A.M.

financial resources she had to leave school. She lives with her partner, who works in construction. She has two children and they are in school. No one else lives with them.\r\n\r\nNubia has been sewing uniforms for 18 years. She says that when she left ninth grade her parents could no longer afford to send her to school, as there were seven siblings. \r\n\r\nDue to that situation she felt it necessary to look for work, and a friend got her into an assembly plant and that's how she learned the occupation. She is a determined person as she says she has done a little bit of everything. She works as a house keeper, selling at a small caf\u00e9, selling bread, and currently has been working in a sewing workshop where they make uniforms for four schools. Her day begins at 4:00 a.m., so that she can get up in time to make breakfast for the family and prepare her children for going to school. She gets to work at 7:00 a.m. and leaves at 4:00 p.m. but in order to earn extra dollars she goes out at 5:00 p.m. and to get to her work walks for 20 minutes. That is her daily routine. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy three steel doors, as the ones she has are of wood and are in poor condition. The rest is to build a bathroom. Her dream is to have her own sewing workshop and help her children become professionals. She wishes to continue studying and pay off the loan so that the doors remain open for her at the institution."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1533251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

familia. En la actualidad vive solo con su esposa, aunque su familia est\u00e1 formada por 4 hijos los cuales ya est\u00e1n separados, tienen su propio hogar. Solo una hija vive con el cliente, pero no depende directamente de \u00e9l,  porque es una joven trabajadora que se dedica a su trabajo de maestra y que es de donde le ayuda a sus padres.\n\nLuis, se dedica a la agricultura desde que ten\u00eda 16 a\u00f1os, porque su padre fue una persona que toda su vida se dedic\u00f3 a cultivar la tierra y es as\u00ed como desde muy peque\u00f1o, inicio a conocer de las actividades que requiere un cultivo de ma\u00edz, maicillo o frijol y es as\u00ed como hoy en d\u00eda agradece esas acciones que su padre le ense\u00f1o porque, conoce de mucho sobre la agricultura y dif\u00edcilmente alguien podr\u00e1 mentirle en las actividades que se requieren en ese cultivo.\n\n Adem\u00e1s de la agricultura, el cliente a aprendido otras actividades, como la ganader\u00eda de donde tiene tambi\u00e9n sus alimentos y esto lo ha realizado poco a poco, con mucho esfuerzo compro una vaca, la cual fue el principio de unas actividades que el cliente desconoc\u00eda. Pero gracias a la ayuda de unos amigos y el apoyo econ\u00f3mico que credicampo, le ha dado al cliente ha ido fortaleciendo su trabajo y es gracias a todo eso que es una persona de muchos conocimientos, en agricultura y ganader\u00eda.\n\nEl dinero que solicita ser\u00e1 destinado para la compra de una vaca, que seg\u00fan el cliente es de buena productora de  leche, su precio oscila por los $900 y con esto estar\u00e1 mejorando su hato de ganadero y la producci\u00f3n de leche.

This activity is what he has done for a long time, and it has been the only source of income from which he has been able to move his family forward. Currently he lives only with his wife, although his family is made up of 4 children who are already independent and have their own homes. Only one daughter lives with him, but she does not depend directly on him because she is a hard-working young person who works as a teacher, and that is how she helps her parents.\r\n\r\nLu\u00eds has worked in agriculture since he was 16 years old because his father was a person who cultivated the land his whole life. This is how, since he was very young, he began to learn about the activities required for a corn, sorghum, or bean crop. Today he is thankful for those actions that his father taught him because he knows a lot about agriculture and it would be hard for someone to be able to lie to him about the activities required for those crops.\r\n\r\nIn addition to agriculture, he has learned other activities, such as ranching, from which he also gets his food. This he has done little by little. With a lot of effort he bought a cow, which was the first of several activities he did not know about. But thanks to the help of some friends and the economic support Credicampo has given him, he has strengthened his work. It is thanks to all of that that he is a person who knows a lot about agriculture and ranching.\r\n\r\nThe money he is requesting will be used to buy a cow, which according to Luis is a good milk producer. Its price is around $900 and with this he will be improving his cattle herd and milk production. The rest of the money will be used to prepare the land he cultivates, which is 14,000 square meters.\r\n\r\nOne of his greatest dreams, and he hopes God gives him the strength to achieve it, is to improve his cattle. This means selling the cows he already has and buying dairy cows, and in this way improving his family's income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1533422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lu\u00eds Alonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832219}],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T06:12:28Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:02:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":676073,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is a lady of forty six years, married, and a mother of five children.

volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser. Sophia is a hardworking and trustworthy member of the community with 5 children. Sophia lives with her family in a house made up of mud walls, dirt floor and iron roof.\n\nKedeta village does not have a piped water supply so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Sophia and 30 other households using the local water sources need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nSophia has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and will also be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine when the tank runs low. Sophia has also volunteered to be the promoter because she likes to work towards her community\u2019s well-being and wants to ensure her community prevents waterborne diseases by always drinking treated water. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding communities who are part of this group loan: Alex, Margrate and Beatrice.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Sophia\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1531437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margrate ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-02-28T00:44:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":671282,"name":"Lu\u00eds Alonso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lu\u00eds de 45 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta  primer grado en la escuela.

Esther has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter and will be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine and encouraging the whole community to treat their household water in order to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy. There are three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding communities who are part of this group loan: Damaris, Grace and Beatrice.\n\nRuvuka village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers in the area. Esther believes that the dispenser will prevent waterborne diseases through killing bacteria and other germs. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits.

The sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Esther\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1531500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To allow the community to treat their water to make it safe to drink using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damaris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-04T15:45:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":671834,"name":"Florence Chahilu's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is 62 years old, has 1 child and lives in Burudi village, Vihiga County, Kenya.

The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Wamuhira, 38 households will benefit from the dispenser by having access to safe water. Violet has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter and will be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine and encouraging the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding communities who are part of this group loan: Mary and Amina. \n\nWamuhira village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Violet believes that the dispenser will prevents waterborne diseases and kill germs. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Violet\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1527766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine dispensers to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T18:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T18:20:10Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-01T22:54:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":676089,"name":"Bienvenida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Due to financial hardships, Bienvenida aims to improve her small variety store to increase her income.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink.

Philis will be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine whenever the tank runs low. Philis has also volunteered to be the promoter because the community members perceive her as informative and she enjoys helping them. She particularly wants to help children in the community, who she knows are always the most affected by water-borne diseases.

Igakala village community collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Igakala village inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by drinking unsafe water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Igakala village, 33 households will benefit from having access to safe water through the dispenser. Tabitha has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter and will be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine whenever the tank runs low and encouraging the community to treat their water in order to keep themselves and their families healthy. There are two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding communities who are part of this group loan: Benard and Benjamin.\n\nIgakala village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers in the area. Tabitha believes that the dispenser will prevent water-borne diseases. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Tabitha\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1533025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-06T01:11:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":676218,"name":"Kodjo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Jeune homme de 29ans, Kodjo est mari\u00e9 et n'a pas d'enfants en charge.

Foster lives with his family in a house made up of concrete walls, concrete floor and iron roof. \n\nNyira village does not have a piped water supply so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water at the point of collection to make it safe for drinking. Foster\u2019s family and other households using the local water sources need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nFoster has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill the dispenser with chlorine whenever the tank runs low. Foster volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to help his community drink safe water. Foster believes that regular chlorine dispenser use will prevent waterborne diseases in the community.

His wife does the housework. He has a daughter and she solely dependent on him. Since he was very young, Celestino worked in agriculture. He has four cows from which he gets milk and sells their by-products. Currently, the majority of his income comes from a beach food shack which he started in this area three years ago. He participates on the tourism committee in his community and is working on projects to increase tourism in this area. He and his wife run the food shack, and it is only open to the public on the weekends after 7:00 in the morning. He has a lot of experience in food service as he worked at a restaurant for many years in the United States. \r\n\r\nHe applied for a loan with CrediCampo to buy tables and chairs since he has very few. He also wants to build a shore barrier for the food shack so that sand cannot come in during high tide and continue to affect his business. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to use the tourism committee to increase publicity for the beach so that the influx of people is not only limited to the weekends so he can be open Monday through Friday. This will improve his sales and the sales of the other people who have businesses in this region.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1534174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy chairs and tables for the food shack.

promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program. Phanice is a friendly, goal oriented, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and a well-known member of the community with 7 children. Phanice lives with her family in a house made of mud walls, dirt floor and iron roof.\n\nBugamangi village does not have a piped water supply so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Phanice and 65 other households using the local water sources need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nPhanice has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and will also be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine when the tank runs low. Phanice volunteered to be the promoter because she is willing to serve the community in the fight against water-borne diseases. She believes that chlorine dispensers will greatly contribute to her community\u2019s wellbeing and prosperity. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding communities who are part of this group loan: Noah, Jescah, Bendeta and Violet.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits.

The community of Madidi village collects their drinking water from a flowing stream because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Madidi\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by drinking unsafe water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Madidi village, 50 households will benefit from having access to safe water through the chlorine dispenser. Felister has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter and will be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine and encouraging the whole community to treat their water in order to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy. There is one other volunteer promoter from the surrounding community who is part of this group loan, named Florence.\n\nMadidi village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers in the area. Felister believes that the dispenser will greatly contribute to improved community health. Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and to make sure that Felister\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1537510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felister ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-03T15:41:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":676174,"name":"Kabessizi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe KABESSIZI sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de  27ans, 2 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles polygames \u00e0 FAKOLA, une des sous -pr\u00e9fectures de la 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s \u00e0 tout moment.

His parents were only able to give him a second grade education, since their economic situation was very low. His family was large, and his parents had to work and couldn't keep all of them in school. Pablo's wife takes care of their home. Their children are studying in a community elementary school and one in high school.\r\n\r\nPablo works selling sweet bread. Every morning, he goes at dawn to get the product from the community bakery. Then he has a route of more than 7 kilometers in various close communities. He does this all morning, 5 days a week. In the winter, he also works growing corn after distributing the bread.\r\n\r\nHe learned this job from a friend who was an area vendor, and now he has been doing this activity for 4 years.

Friendship Bridge Trust Bank was formed here called \u201cOrquideas Visitecas\u201d meaning \u201cVisiteca Orchids\u201d. The group consists of eight women whose average age is 29 years. One of the leaders of the Trust Bank is 18-year-old Magdalena. After graduating from high school and failing in her search for a job, Magdalena opened a pharmacy. Soon after, she found herself pregnant and a single mom. Since her business is progressing well, she wants to improve it even more and so, she is requesting a loan to invest additional capital to purchase more medicines and increase her inventory. Madgalena has received valuable and relevant educational training about medicines. She is associated with two medical professionals in the community. Her customers will avail themselves of the expertise of the three of them. This will be especially important in cases of emergency.\r\n\r\nMagdalena, along with the seven other ladies of \u201cOrqideas Visitecas\u201d, is looking forward with great anticipation to their monthly meetings with a Loan Officer from Friendship Bridge. They not only make repayments on their loans but also receive training on topics like women\u2019s identity and leadership, Marketing and business administration, as well as health and self-esteem. The women are hungry to learn about these subjects and more, so that they can more fully educate and develop themselves.\r\n\r\nMagdalena and The \u201cOrquideas Visitecas\u201d Trust Bank wishes to express their gratitude to KIVA investors for their confidence and their belief that the women can climb out of poverty with a loan and education. Armed with these tools, the women can step into a more prosperous future, benefiting themselves, their families, and their community of Santa Maria Visitacion."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1535204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more medicines and increase the inventory of her pharmacy.

She is married to her husband who is a farmer. She is a mother of 5 young children who study in the community's school. With her husband, and only the two of them, they work in farming. Farming coffee is their source of financial income, an activity she has been doing for 10 years, having learned it from her parents. The land they farm is their own thanks to having inherited part of it and bought the other part. They thank God that the land produces coffee and that it is located one kilometer away from their house, to where they go by bus from their community. Their goals, plans and dreams are to maintain their coffee crops in excellent conditions, to buy more land to grow a better variety of coffee, and in this way to insure the necessary earnings to give their children a different level of life. They would like them to be prepared for a college career and to find good jobs so they have a different income. Therefore she is requesting financial support which she will invest in cleaning and buying agriculture inputs to fertilize, foliar feed and pay laborers to maintain the land.

","en":"This is Camilo. What Camilo wants is to acquire various skills, making the most of his time and thoroughly exploring different subjects that he's interested in, so he can get into every possible field.\r\nHe believes that in today's world it is necessary for a person to have knowledge of multiple areas, because they will always be well-accepted and will be able to tackle any task that they're assigned, not necessarily work-related. This will always bring them new experiences.\r\nHis immediate goal is to begin his studies in auto mechanics and get a degree in this field of expertise. This is a subject that he's very interested in, especially in regards to knowing the parts that make up the engines, how they work and how important each one of them is.\r\nFrom an early age, Camilo has been interested in cars, mechanics and, in general, devices that have to do with manual, electronic or electric movement. Perhaps herein lies the connection to his enjoyment and his penchant for skating, an extreme sport that is a hobby and a passion for him and that brings him a great deal of adrenaline and interest in wheels.\r\nWhat motivates Camilo is how enthusiastic he gets everytime he thinks about his biggest hobby: skating. His dream is to combine his studies with his hobby. Gradually he begins to ask himself how to get an idea to create a new device or machine that combines his studies and his training with his favorite sport.\r\nIn two years, Camilo would like to own his own business repairing vehicles and manufacuring unique accessories that are different from the ordinary ones, luxury and exclusive. That way he'll become well-known and popular in his trade and he'll be able to teach others, and above all he'll provide job opportunities for young people with no experience. Unfortunately, in his country they have limited opportunities, and their energy and especially their creativity need to be put to use.\r\nNevertheless, in order to get there he has to go through several steps, and that takes practice. Therefore, first he has to start working some place where he'll get experience and ask around about so many well-known and renowned places that are mainly in Bogota, so he can get a job in one of them.\r\nAt the moment, the loan would be of great help to Camilo, because his parents would have to pay for his tuition fees. Since he's currently beginning his first semester, he still has two more to go, and each semester the costs would increase."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1530481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one semester's tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T20:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T20:00:11Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johan Camilo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-03-17T09:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":459069853},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882801},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202165},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286306},{"amount":65,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":132111.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225013}],"funded_date":"2014-02-27T21:08:46Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":673700,"name":"Ara Poty Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Ara Poty est\u00e1 en el 2\u00ba ciclo  del programa de Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras, donde todas trabajan y se ayudan por salir adelante.

When he married, given that he was unable to study, he decided to look for work on the farm and from that be able to support his family. The work is four kilometers away and during the season the schedule is from 8 to 4 pm.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will buy material to expand his house, which was built for him by the church and Caritas, since his house was destroyed by the earthquake.

With this, he will improve his family's condition, since when his children visit him, they note that they do not have enough room in his house.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to be able to repair his house in order to have a better home, since his family is a little large, and when Christmas comes and they all visit him he says that at times they have to sleep in the hallway due to the small amount of space his little house has.

","en":"Anipa is 58 years old, a widow, a single mother with a son whose husband died in 1996. Anipa has a secondary education. The primary income for the family is Anipa's work in farming and animal husbandry. She started 19 years ago when she bought 10,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Anipa's hard work, her farm now has a dairy cow, twenty sheep, and a 4.50 hectare plot of land where she grows beans. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Anipa approached Bai-Tushum for a loan to buy cattle for breeding. Anipa plans to invest profits she makes from the loan into increasing her livestock, and she plans save money to educate her grandson.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1538382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Boo-Terek village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":53.98,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":682.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":585},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":682.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":682.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":35445.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947139},{"amount":580.21,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":30381.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.79,"payment_id":579488898},{"amount":633.31,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":35445.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":49.19,"payment_id":624798837}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T15:32:21Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T09:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":676115,"name":"Goretti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Goretti, a 55-year-old widowed mother of three from Embu, owns a business selling cereals and other grains.

After her husband's death, she raised two children. Shirinkan has a secondary education. The family's primary source of income is Shirinkan's work in farming and livestock. She started 30 years ago when she bought 1,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Shirinkan's hard work, her farm now has a dairy cow and 0.60 hectares of irrigated land where she plants beans. Her monthly income is 16,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Shirinkan approached the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan to buy bulls.  Shirinkan plans to use profits from the loan to increase her livestock, and she plans to save money for her eldest son's

She has 8 children and is a single mother who is very enterprising. She could only study until the fifth grade and has made an effort, on her own, to help her family get ahead. Two of her children are adults and already have their own households. Her remaining six children are dependent on her. \r\n\r\nVilma has been a merchant for 15 years. She leaves every day in the afternoons to sell tamales and bread in adjacent neighborhoods. This job is a bit tiring but the desire to help her family get ahead motivates her. She learned this business from her mother, who was also a merchant.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan from CrediCampo in order to cover a debt that she incurred a year ago when she faced a serious family problem and needed to request a loan. Consequently she now has to repay it and at the moment does not have the exact amount. Thus she needs help and will also invest a part of this loan in her business so that she can continue working and supporting her family.\r\n\r\nVilma dreams of having a stable business that will enable her to earn enough to provide her children with an education and cover household expenses. She also wants to have a small farm in order to earn a supplementary income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1534309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

She also skillfully embroiders the dresses with different kinds of beads, creating flowers and other decorative designs. She is an experienced and talented seamstress. Guloro says she has a special interest in sewing and turned it into a business. Her mentor was able to pass on skills and help her become a good seamstress.\r\n\r\nGuloro used a sewing machine she rented from her neighbors before she bought her own. But as the demand for high-quality sewing and embroidery began to increase, she decided to apply for a loan to buy a modern sewing machine. This will help her small business to survive and allow her to serve more customers and earn enough money to support her children's education and her family's well-being. She hopes that the loan will be the foundation for new opportunities and open doors to a brighter future. She thanks Kiva for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1536062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T20:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T20:50:07Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guloro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":76.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":81.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":89.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":92.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":99.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":102.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":111.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.12,"local_amount":76.1,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":82.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467960267},{"amount":17.7,"local_amount":78.68,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":85.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479181035},{"amount":18.3,"local_amount":81.35,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875631},{"amount":18.92,"local_amount":84.1,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":90.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302857},{"amount":19.57,"local_amount":86.96,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":93.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585657},{"amount":20.23,"local_amount":89.9,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":97.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081237},{"amount":20.91,"local_amount":92.95,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562118},{"amount":21.62,"local_amount":96.1,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":103.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694810},{"amount":22.36,"local_amount":99.36,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":107.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626603},{"amount":22.84,"local_amount":102.73,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":111.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":595209096},{"amount":24.63,"local_amount":111.77,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":120.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":610752084}],"funded_date":"2014-02-28T02:34:45Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":676134,"name":"Mt Ulunguru Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose, who is in her early forties, is married with three children who are still in school. She has been running a poultry business for one year now.  She works from 8 am to 8 pm daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Rose's 14th loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans for buying and selling chicken layers (which are for meat only not for laying eggs).

Her previous loan was a big help to her business because she was able to buy needed products for her variety store. The loan also helped her to meet her household expenditures. She and her husband are helping each other to provide for their everyday needs. \r\n\r\nJemina would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. She hopes that having more items to sell will result in better profits. Additional profits will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nJemina dreams of expanding her business. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Serliana has been running a kiosk business since last year. She decided to run the business in order to assist her husband in fulfilling the family needs. They spent their own money IDR 3.500.000 to initiate the business. The kiosk is selling daily needs to their neighbourhood such as sugar, instant noodles, cooking oil, shampoo, soap and detergent etc.  Serliana plans to add more stock to her kiosk such as kerosene and gasoline. Therefore she applied for an individual loan of IDR 3.000.000 to TLM. The loan will be spent on cooking oil, gasoline, kerosene, instant noodles and eggs etc. She is hoping the loan from TLM will help her to improve her business in the future.

He also farms during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nHe has lots of experience in the tile business and has been working on this as long as he can remember.  His father taught him the trade and he is grateful because this is how he supports his family.  He works Monday through Saturday from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm.  His brother helps him.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan to buy supplies (clay, white dirt, sod, firewood, and other things he needs).  This dry season is the perfect time for making tiles.  He also tells us that he has customer orders.  He also needs to repair his kiln which is in bad shape.
