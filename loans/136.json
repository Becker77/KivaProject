She runs a sewing business out of a 10 square meter rental room. In 2007, she started her business by buying a sewing machine and fabric that cost MNT 40,000 ($1.00 USD=1,600.00 MNT). Her business has been successful ever since and allowed her to purchase three more sewing machines and hire two tailors. Her working capital has grown from 40,000 MNT to 1.5 million MNT. Her daily income now is around 1.0 million MNT. She gets many orders due to the lack of competing businesses in her area. With her profits, her husband built a 40 sq. meter house on the plot of land that they own. Before her business flourished, she lived in a \"ger\" (traditional, nomadic form of tent housing) in the local ger district.

His tailor's shop, which he started with much effort and dedication, is located on one of the most centrally situated streets of the city of Juliaca. \r\n\r\nHe is a very skilled tailor, so that he always has clients for whom he makes good suits. What Publio likes most is to observe the results of his labor and see how, with much determination, he can create a piece of clothing of very good quality. He has been working in this field for eight years and believes that the most difficult is to cut the cloth without making a mistake since any error of his steady hand could spoil a whole day's work and cost him a lot of money. \r\n\r\nTo move ahead he wants to have a larger tailor's shop where he can provide better service to his clients. This is the second loan Publio has with MFP. He knows that he has to pay all the installments on time and is ready to do so. In his community bank he is a very responsible member. With the 1500 soles requested he will buy a mending (sewing) machine to improve the work that he performs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":324573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-28T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Publio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":251.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596325},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":251.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990627},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":251.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211738},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":251.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641262},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":251.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080700},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":251.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996833}],"funded_date":"2009-05-28T10:02:47Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Burke","image":11816}},{"id":114994,"name":"Sagheer Choudhary Iqbal Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukhsana baji wants a loan to buy a sewing machine for sewing clothes. <P>\r\n\r\nHuzaira Bano baji wants a loan to buy juicer machine for her drinks corner. <P>\r\n\r\nSamra baji wants a loan to buy cloth for her cloth-selling business. <P>\r\n\r\nRukhsana baji wants a loan to buy costume jewelry to sell. <P>\r\n\r\nMy name is Sagheer and I have been living in a city named Lahore, Pakistan for the past 15 years.

Rahima lives in Dushanbe, Tajikistan with two children. She has been selling women's clothing in one of the local markets for 5 years. Due to her highly motivated entrepreneurial spirit and meticulous survey of the market, Rahima has found her niche and customer base. Her unique ability to market her inventory and meet her customers' needs is contributing to the rapid growth of her business. However Rahima believes her venture has only started to grow and there is still great potential for further expansion. She would love to open more vending facilities. Her strategy is to increase her stock and generate additional profits which will then be reinvested in her trade. That is why Rahima is asking for a loan of $500 US to purchase new inventory and help develop and upgrade her small business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Actualmente vive solo, pues es soltero. Su dedicaci\u00f3n principal son los cultivos de caf\u00e9, pl\u00e1tanos y frutos c\u00edtricos (naranjas y mandarinas), con los cuales se siente muy feliz. Nos comenta que la siembra de caf\u00e9 es dificultosa porque el abonado debe ser constante y eso requiere de mucha inversi\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s que se cosecha cada a\u00f1o. Pero en el caso de los pl\u00e1tanos, aunque tambi\u00e9n necesitan de abono, su cosecha es semanal o cada quincena, donde los compradores van hasta su chacra y le compran por racimos dependiendo del tama\u00f1o de los pl\u00e1tanos. Con respecto a las naranjas, las vende por ciento. Cirilo prefiere vender sus frutos desde su chacra, en vez de transportarlos y comercializarlos \u00e9l mismo, pues aun as\u00ed logra buenas ganancias. A \u00e9l lo acaban de invitar a integrarse a un banco comunal, por lo que se siente muy agradecido. Asimismo, hace compromisos de pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente. El dinero del cr\u00e9dito que viene solicitando lo piensa invertir en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos para sus cultivos cafetaleros.","en":"Cirilo is 38 years old and fighting for a better life. He currently lives alone, as he is single. His main activity is growing coffee, bananas, and citrus fruits (oranges and tangerines), and this makes him happy.\r\n\r\nHe told us that planting coffee is difficult because it requires fertilizer constantly, which requires a lot of investment considering it is only harvested once a year. Although the bananas also require fertilizer, they can be harvested every 1 to 2 weeks. Buyers come to Cirilo's farm to buy the bananas by the bunch, depending on the size of the fruit. He sells the oranges by the hundred. \r\n\r\nCirilo prefers selling the fruit at his farm, instead of transporting and selling it in a market, because he makes better profit that way. He has recently been invited to join a community bank, and feels very grateful. That is why he has committed to making all his repayments on time. He plans to use the loan money he is requesting to invest in chemical fertilizers for his coffee crop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":374834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-22T06:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1036,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751007}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T17:13:40Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":135516,"name":"Rabab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rabab is a young married woman who lives with her husband and five children in the city of Nablus in Palestine.

Adolphe\u2019s wife is a farmer and they both work hard for the development of their family. Adolphe owns a small shop which sells spare parts. This is his 5th year of successful operation in business! The hours of his shop are from 6 in the morning to 8 in the evening every day except on Saturday.\r\n\r\nEven though Adolphe has a lot of experience, his monthly profit is too low to expand meaningfully and he believes that a small amount of additional capital would change that for him.

The main activity is agriculture. They grow potatoes, papaliza, and beans on their 2.5 hectares of land in the community of Pie de Gallo. His wife helps in the farming, taking care of cattle and the house.  \r\n\r\nMr. Feliciano H. Jim\u00e9nez and his family live in the rural community of Pie de Gallo, 62 km from the city. Because of this it is very hard for them to go to the bank for a money loan.  El Cidre had the initiative of going to this rural area.   \r\n\r\nMr. Feliciano H. needs the money to buy agricultural materials. He tells us that he has to renew the seed every three years, because the seed has an illness and in order to plant in new lots new, healthy seed has to be used.  For this reason, the harvest this year has been low and the prices have gone down. That is the reason he doesn't have enough money to buy materials. With the new seed, production will go up and his income will improve. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":583166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase agricultural materials to plant potatoes.

She takes orders from her neighborhood clients and fulfills the orders at a given time to earn profits. The income generated helps her to pay the school fees of her daughter and to pay the utility bills.  She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for the improvement of her sewing business.

Their  two children who are 9 and 16 years old, are currently going to school. Bernarditha joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she also aspired to do something to improve her family's future wellbeing. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bernarditha has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase merchandise to sell in her general store so that she can continue to support her family's day to day expenses and her children's school expenses as well as save up for future house renovations and to send her children to school.

She is married to a businessman, and has 2 children, aged 20 and 6 years, who go to school.  She has 1 additional dependent - a niece, who lives with her so she can attend a good school in town.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Rugiatu established her retail business selling jeans, baby wrappers, blankets, blouse, nickers, and jewelry.  When her mother died, Rugiatu was a child and her father could not take good care of her, so she had to live with his father's closest friend.  She could not attend school because her caretaker did not think it appropriate.  Several years later, the caretaker died and Rugiatu had to live with her older brother.  They could barely afford to feed her, let alone pay for her schooling.  So Rugiatu started trading in order to help with the household expenses.  Ever since then, business is all she knows.  <p>\r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,798,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan of Le 4,500,000.  Rugiatu has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase ladies sandals - 3 cartons @ Le500,000, ladies jeans 60 pieces @ Le15,000, tights for ladies 120 pieces @ Le15,000, the balance Le300,000 as transportation.  She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 270,000. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Rugiatu plans to build a house with a shop and is nervous about the future because she has a lot to do, to achieve her dreams.  She wants her children to be educated.  The loan will help as she will generate more income to run her business.  Her major challenge is the rainy season.  Though she sells in a secure stall that protects from the rain, she has fewer customers and therefore less profit during this season.  Competition is high but she offers affordable prices, latest designs and quality goods.  She serves about 15 customers per day, all ladies in the city and nearby villages .

La imprenta la pudo adquirir gracias a un cr\u00e9dito bancario hace muchos a\u00f1os, y recientemente pudo cancelar esa deuda.\r\n\r\nA un inicio, apenas pod\u00eda comprar algunos restos de resmas de papel que le vend\u00edan a bajo costo otras imprentas o papeleras, y las tintas las consegu\u00eda mediante obsequios o regalos consistentes en latas o esp\u00e1tulas usadas. En ocasiones y por la demanda de trabajo, Liliana debe quedarse a dormir todo el fin de semana dentro de la imprenta, todo para reunir el dinero suficiente para el alimento de sus hijos y el alquiler de su imprenta.\r\n\r\nActualmente Liliana necesita de dinero para poder comprar una computadora de dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico, con el fin de mejorar sus productos y agilizar su trabajo.

He is 20 years old, lives in Dushanbe, and has been working in the clothing industry for the past 3 years. He was able to expand his small business, over the year, into a well-known shop in the neighborhood. <P>\r\n\r\nMehrovar is a very enterprising lad with a great desire to get ahead. His business has been able to show the fruits of his labor and he hopes to grow as a businessman. He needs a loan of 675 USD, which he plans to invest in inventory in order to offer better service and variety to his customers. You can be an important part of the growth of this business. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Their oldest son is a police officer at a local railway police station. Their oldest daughter is a student at a university and their youngest son is a fourth-grade student in a district high school.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2002, Tungalagtuya started running a small retail stall for handbags and women's apparel in the Hohburd market, one of the large markets in Ulaanbaatar. However, she was not making a stable profit in the Hohburd market and thus decided to move her business elsewhere. It has been about a year since she moved to the Norjin retail center.

He is 33 years old, married with two children aged 12 and 14. He finished 6th grade but had to drop school to get a job. He lives with his wife and children and supports his mother who lives in Maputo. His wife does some occasional work to help with household expenses. Sousa has been working as a construction worker for the same company for 14 years and makes 2.452,00MT (about U$90) per month. He also does construction jobs in the weekends for people in his neighborhood, in order to make more money. He makes around 3.000,00MT (about U$ 110) per month with freelance work and he is even able to save some money.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elisapeta joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Elisapeta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Elisapeta T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.66 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 35 years old. Lilibeth is the group leader of a 17-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLilibeth is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Lilibeth owns & operates a general store where she sells daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Lilibeth has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lilibeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilibeth is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Lilibeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Hilaria owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Hilaria has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Hilaria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hilaria is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand the range of products in her store. This loan will be her seventh loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Nato sells on average 20 piglets per year. Along with the pig farm, the family owns a 300 sq meter greenhouse, which is used for growing cucumbers and tomatoes. The total average monthly income from the agriculture is 500 Laris. \r\n\r\nNato requested a loan to develop the pig farm. She will repair the existing pigsty and purchase additional piglets, which will be raised on the farm. After a couple of the months, the piglets will be sold for a higher price. Nato plans to reinvest part of the profit in the same business, in order to increase the amount of pigs in the business, which will give them more piglets to sell.

Now she runs her business in a small space located in a new part of the central market. She has one employee that helps with sales. She now offers a large variety of products: Clothing, shoes, cosmetics, picture frames, articles for children etc. Her business, however, is still on a small scale.The first loan that CEPRODEL granted her was for C$1,500 c\u00f3rdobas and has helped her for three years (even though she still sold her products in the streets).\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Alexandra Jaffe, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEsta se\u00f1ora es originaria de la ciudad de Le\u00f3n.

Hasan has been in this business for 18 years. Now is time to plant, therefore the client needs additional resources to purchase wheat seeds, fertilizer and pay for tractor rent.

She is a very hard-working person and has always searched for opportunities to get ahead.  Three years ago, she decided to open a countryside restaurant.  After several years of selling food as a street vendor and many requests from her customers, she started this business, which is growing quickly.  Because of the great flavor with which she makes her food, her traditional dishes are a success.  For her, cooking is a pleasure.  The difficult part is when she doesn't have enough food in stock to attend to her customers.  Alicia works hard so her two children can improve themselves through their studies.

He is single with a nine year-old boy.  Apart from his son, Manix takes also care of two abandoned boys and a girl between the ages of 5 and 15. All of them attend school. Manix started his first business in 1995 as a money changer. His starting capital was $120 and he worked outdoors until 1999 when his monthly income allowed him to move his business indoors. He worked very hard and his business prospered. In 2001, his business working capital reached $1500. Unfortunately, he lost all of this money when thieves broke into his place of business and stole it.  Due to this traumatic event, Manix closed his business. He and his children went through a hard time as he had neither a job nor any income to support them financially. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Manix borrowed $200 from one of his best customers to re-launch his business. He re-launched it outdoors until August 2008 when he joined one of Hope\u2019s groups named \"Beny\".  Manix used the first loan he received from Hope last September to diversify his business. He added another type of business selling cellular phones. With the second loan he received from Hope, he reinforced his working capital. Currently, his business capital is equivalent to $700. His business makes about $200 of profit per month. Manix likes this business because it is profitable and it helps him become economically stable, especially concerning food, housing, electricity and water bills and school fees for his children. \r\n\r\nManix\u2019s business requires honesty and patience to keep his permanent customers. He is glad to join Hope\u2019s group because he hopes to enhance his business with Hope's loans. With the next loan from Hope, Manix is planning to move his business indoors in order to avoid the heavy rains during the rainy season and the strong sun. Manix sells in the most populated area located in the North Eastern area of Kinshasa.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":263031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To reinforce his working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She and her husband were also able to build a new house for themselves with their business profit.

In 2007 he opened a car spare parts shop as his own business. His father takes care of the family expenses but the borrower is trying to help him with his business income as the majority of Lebanese children do.  \r\n\r\nDespite his young age, he was able during this short period in the field to build up a good business reputation and he is thankful for his decision. He is requesting to borrow US$ 1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy more spare parts and enlarge his shop to meet the requirements of his customers and make a good income for his family. He plans to open a bigger store to sell spare parts and  one day, he would like to  open a commercial center.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

By the grace of God, Helen has managed to support her older child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send the rest of her children all the way through college--a dream for most Filipino parents like Helen, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a fish stall. Fish is bought fresh from nearby ports and piers, packed in ice and then brought to the local markets. Helen and her husband clean, gut and chop fish per customer orders. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 350 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy fish for their everyday inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHelen dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes that her family can migrate and work in other countries in the near future. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Eight women have gathered together in a small rural community to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cFlor de Encino\u201d.  The ladies mainly have traditional textile businesses since there is a big demand for the colorful and ornate blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d, woven skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d and table linens like napkins.\n\nCatalina is the strong and energetic President of the Trust Bank. She is 55 years old, a mother of nine children who works hard to give her children all that she can. She was only able to stay in school until the 6th grade since times were economically tough when she was a child. Catalina has a traditional textile business and makes \u201chuipiles\u201d, as well as \u201ccortes\u201d. She greatly values the loans that she has received and is now requesting a new one to buy various colors and textures of thread as well as \u201ccortes\u201d to sell.\n\nIt has been traditional in the indigenous groups in Guatemala that girls stay in school for only a few years and then help out with household chores, as well as learn to weave. Approximately 80% of the ladies in the Trust Bank were unable to attend school.  They got married at an early age and had between four to nine children. They want to change the tradition that girls cannot go to school since they are keenly aware of the value of a good education. Fortunately, in their monthly meetings, they have the opportunity to participate in educational trainings conducted by a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge. They actively participate in games and role playing as they learn about self-esteem, women\u2019s rights and how to set goals and realize their dreams. \n\nCatalina and the ladies of the \u201cFlor de Encino\u201d Trust Bank thank KIVA investors for funding their much-needed loans. Their success has such positive effects on their families and their community.

She is 32 years old and has a 7-year old child who is in primary school.  Her husband is self-employed as a construction worker, and he sometimes works on contract.  It is hard work but brings good earnings.  Damaris has worked as a housekeeper for two years, since she had trouble finding other work due to few opportunities.

Philippines.  She is a 46-year-old single woman with one school-age child.  To earn a living, Nelda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector; more specifically, she runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.  Her main source of income is derived from selling both food and everyday products to her local community members.  Nelda explains that she has been engaged in this business for over 12 years, and that she typically earns approximately 10,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nelda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services; as a result, she was able to engage in business activities, and, in turn, to improve her family's standard of living.  Importantly, Nelda has already successfully repaid a previous loan from HSPFI in the amount of 14,000 PHP, which was used to purchase additional products to sell.  In fact, the loan that she is now requesting would be the fifth loan taken out by Nelda from HSPFI.  Indeed, Nelda is now seeking another loan from HSPFI, this time in the amount of 15,000 PHP ($325), which will again be used to purchase additional products for resale purposes.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to supplement her family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI: HSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City, and its mission is to assist the poor households of Northern

She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Katerina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Katerina joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Katerina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Katerina E. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2.1 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.89 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

With much effort and dedication she\u2019s kept her business active for many years and that\u2019s how she wants to continue to keep it because it\u2019s very important for her to have this source of income because her husband\u2019s salary isn\u2019t quite enough to cover all the household needs.\r\n\r\nThis is why she\u2019s asking Integral for a loan to buy supplies both for her store and for her eatery.  She will therefore use the loan to buy vegetables, grains, fruit, meats, eggs, snacks, beverages, oil, etc. with the goal in mind of improving the service she offers so that she can cover a larger demand that will lead to increased income and as a result improve her and her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":909326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Mustafoevna B. lives in the town of Tursun-zoda. She is a widow, 47 years old with two children. She has secondary education. Halima is in the retail business of buying and selling fabrics for national Tajik dresses and has been doing it for more than five years. By working from her home she is able to take care of her small children. It's also convenient for her neighbors to buy from her without having to travel outside of town. This business is the only source of income for her family. At this time, Halima wants to buy more fabrics because the time for lighter clothes is around the corner. She does not have enough capital so she decided to apply for a loan. She plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430

In addition to farming, she raises cattle, poultry, and goats just to earn a living. She is so happy with these activities because each one helps her and her family in one way or another. She is asking for a loan that she hopes will help her pay the school fees for her six school-going children. She is planning to repay her loan by selling milk from her two cows as well as by selling produce like matooke, cassava, and sweet potatoes from her farm. She also says that the loan helps to pay the laborers that she employs on her farm under the direct supervision of both herself and her husband.

S. is 27 and married with 2 children (ages 5 and 10).  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Menime needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 111 tala or US $46 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Menime joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Menime's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Menime S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.1 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With a goal to have an additional source of income Jailobai provides a season service of combine-harvester driver to the residents of the nearby villages. To further develop his business Jailobai has come to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to buy cattle.
