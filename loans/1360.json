His family did not have the resources to provide him the opportunity so he had to go to work at an early age.  He is married and his wife does the housework and helps him with his farming.  They have three children and they are in school.\r\n\r\nRoman makes tiles at local factories and during the dry season (summer) he has his own tile business.  He also farms during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nHe has lots of experience in the tile business and has been working on this as long as he can remember.  His father taught him the trade and he is grateful because this is how he supports his family.  He works Monday through Saturday from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm.  His brother helps him.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan to buy supplies (clay, white dirt, sod, firewood, and other things he needs).  This dry season is the perfect time for making tiles.  He also tells us that he has customer orders.  He also needs to repair his kiln which is in bad shape.  This is where he fires his tiles.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to expand his business, buy a vehicle so he can transport his orders, making his sales easier and also generating more income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1521667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-02-27T22:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-29T22:40:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rom\u00e1n Alcides","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.22,"local_amount":74.22,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":74.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467902995},{"amount":76.48,"local_amount":76.48,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":76.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817537},{"amount":73.31,"local_amount":73.31,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":73.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526064},{"amount":275.99,"local_amount":275.99,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":275.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008531}],"funded_date":"2014-03-01T00:58:34Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:18:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

","en":"Anor is a kindhearted and responsible woman of 55. She lives with her husband and four children in a rural area near the mountains. Anor's family is very harmonious - everyone tries to do something to bring income into the home. Anor herself works fattening and selling livestock and processing milk. She always has her own milk and then sells a percentage to the neighbours. Anor's husband is on a pension, but he doesn't sit around doing nothing either - he helps her take care of the farm and look after the animals. His main job is to take the livestock to the market and sell them. Her sons also help their parents.\r\n\r\nAnor has turned to Arvand as she wants a loan to purchase a few more head of livestock to fatten. She doesn't have the means to purchase them herself, but she needs to expand the business in order to increase revenue. She wants to purchase livestock with the loan money. She thanks Arvand in advance for the financial support.

She is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 57 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Christine has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nChristine is married and has children.  She is 22 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking, and experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group.  Christine believes that she can have a better harvest this year by working with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nChristine is preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Christine joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods and purchase fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nChristine plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and repair the home. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n \r\nChristine and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":1497001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase  hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-28T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-30T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylvonos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":304893,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304893}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3550,"local_amount":304893,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":307003.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723068}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T01:36:34Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:36:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":676201,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is a 32-year-old married man from Kakamega.

farmers. They are located in Kakamega North District.  The group leaders in this group represent a total of 52 individual farmers (not pictured). Each of the farmers is asking for an average loan of 5,349 Kenya shillings. Each of them will use his or her loan to purchase a One Acre Fund package, sufficient to cultivate one-quarter acre of maize and one-quarter acre of sorghum or millet. As the representative of this Kiva group comprised of farmer-leaders, Rosemary is pictured on the right of the group with her hand raised.\r\n\r\nRosemary is a reliable member of the community. She is married and has two children. She is 56 years old and she has been working as a farmer for the past 21 years to support her family. In addition, Rosemary is very active in her community, including involvement in the women's group and savings group. The 2013 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Rosemary\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. She first joined One Acre Fund in 2011.  She has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. She described her harvest last year as \"Good.\" She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success she has been having with the One Acre Fund farm packages. \r\n\r\nAs an active member in her community, Rosemary also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she wants to help more farmers.  Rosemary plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school and to save for the future. She has improved her life by working with One Acre Fund because she has more farm training and she is able to feed the family. Rosemary and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers with the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings along to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is included in the photo with the farmer-leaders and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":1538503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the cultivation of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-28T01:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-30T01:10:11Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenipha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":278148,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278148}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3225,"local_amount":278148,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":278897.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723071}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T21:47:24Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Dietz","image":1476253}},{"id":673861,"name":"Salvador De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Salvador tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad, no tuvo la oportunidad de estudiar, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado y su compa\u00f1era de vida se dedica al trabajo dom\u00e9stico, tiene 5 hijos de los cuales tres est\u00e1n estudiando  y los otros 2 ya formaron sus propios hogares, por lo tanto solo 3 hijos y su pareja dependen de \u00e9l.\n \nEl trabajo en la agricultura es la actividad a la cual se dedica Salvador, lo realiza desde que ten\u00eda 13 a\u00f1os de edad, este trabajo lo aprendi\u00f3 de su padre, pues siempre se preocup\u00f3 para que sus hijos aprendieran un oficio para que en un futuro se pudieran defender en un trabajo.

When they come back with the grains, they pay them a good price, but to get this, he needs to pay someone to transport the corn to his house in a wagon, and he also needs to pay for a machine to take the kernels off the corn. In addition, he needs a person to help him harvest the beans and later to choose good seeds to take to this institution. This loan will help him a lot, since he and his spouse alone cannot do all this work. \r\n\r\nHe says that he hopes that \"God will grant him life\" to keep cultivating the land and have the means to support his household, since his earnings are what is left after he sells his crops.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. \r\n\r\nGrace is a reliable member of the community.  She is married with nine children.  Grace is 53-years-old and has been working as a farmer for the last two years to support her family.  In addition to this, Grace is very active in her community and involved in the women's group and savings group.  She described her harvest last year as excellent.  She hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer, she will be able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers who have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program!  Grace joined One Acre Fund in 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  \r\n\r\nGrace joined One Acre Fund so that she can get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed her family. Because she likes being a leader and an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Grace has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva's representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Grace's life because she has more profits from the harvest and group support, was able to save money and feed the family. In the future, Grace hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, save for the future, and invest in a business. \r\n\r\nGrace and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay Kiva's loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizers when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.

Her job is about an hour\u2019s distance by bus, and she works from 7:00 a. m. until 5:00 p.m. every day except Tuesday, her day off. \r\n\r\nShe needs this loan in order to improve her home. She will purchase sheeting for the kitchen, which she has built with a lot of effort.  She just started repairing it, and she hopes to finish with the help of the loan.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s goals include making the kitchen more comfortable so that her mother could also use it; and through hard work, give her daughter what is necessary\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1535244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, Josephat also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and wants to help more farmers. Josephat plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, save for the future and buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from his harvest, has more farm training, and is able to feed the family. Josephat also joined One Acre Fund because he wants more food surplus. Josephat\u2019s life has also improved because he pays school fees. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Josephat and the Mabadiliko Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":1538533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To access hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-02-28T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-30T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":3900,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bainito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jafred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sifuna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":336987,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3900,"local_amount":336987,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":337271.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723073}],"funded_date":"2014-03-05T02:08:36Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":676298,"name":"Vitalis' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vitalis is a member of the Imara Group in Busia District.

For a long time now they have had to go a long way to bring back water to drink and wash with. He will invest $500 in installing 200 metres of pipes for the water and he will pay the workers. He will invest the rest of the loan in his home to create a floor out of sand and cement, since the current dirt floor is causing his children respiratory illnesses.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 dreams of

She lives alone in a small room she owns in the community.  Claudia is the last of five siblings. Sadly her mother died and left her an orphan at 10 years of age, which is why she was raised by her aunties after her father left the country and abandoned her. Claudia was able to study until Year 9 in the school in her village. She had to walk 20 minutes to get to school.\r\n\r\nThis young woman has been through a lot of difficulties. Since the age of 12 Claudia had to start working, washing clothes for her relatives and neighbours to earn her keep ever day. She went to school in the morning and worked in the afternoon. She still works washing clothes and raising small animals such as pigs and poultry.  \r\n\r\nClaudia needs this loan to buy three pigs at $80 each, having already ordered from the community.

The second child is in his first year of study toward a degree in Physical Education.  She and her husband live alone, but her children stay with them on the weekends since they are still dependent on them.  <br \/><br \/>Blanca works as the director of a school in her canton.  She has been in this profession for 30 years.  From the time she was a girl, Blanca dreamed of becoming a teacher because she enjoyed studying.  Therefore, she decided on this profession and moved forward.  At the moment, this is her only means of earning a living.  Prior to working, her only responsibility was helping her parents with the household chores.  The school where she works is two kilometers away from her house.  In order to get to work, she travels by bus, but sometimes she will ride with her husband on his motorcycle.  <br \/><br \/>Blanca will invest this loan in the purchase of two books that her son needs for his medical studies.  The rest of the money will be used to pay his enrollment fees and the first few tuition payments at the university.  She will also buy other materials that both of her children need so that they can save money and invest it in other needs that may arise.  <br \/><br \/>Blanca dreams of seeing her children graduate with their university degrees and continue on toward starting their families.

He is pictured here in a group of nine One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 82 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Egesa has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nEgesa is a reliable member of the community. He is married and has three children. Egesa is 38 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 15 years to support his family. In addition to this, Egesa is very active in his community and is involved in groups like the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. He described his harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund. He hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer he is able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers who have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program! \r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season will be Egesa\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He joined this year in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, Egesa has also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre farmers. He believes that his life will improve as a One Acre Fund farmer. \r\n\r\nEgesa and the Imara Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\n The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1488232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet and sorghum.

She learned while very young to cultivate the land, and with the help of her life partner she has a lot of experience growing coffee.  Maria Aracely has 5 children who attend the community school, and she and her partner work every day so that they will have everything they need, or at least the basics such as clothing, food and medicine, although with many restrictions.  The economic activity that earns income for the family is growing coffee.  The property that they own is located 15 kilometers from their house. The couple travels there by bus from their community.  Once the coffee is harvested they sell it in the same community, to family, friends and intermediaries. Her greatest desire is that her children become professionals and have a better future.  This is why she and her partner struggle every day, so that it will be possible to make needed improvements to their home, and little by little increase their harvest until they are the best producers in the area.  They are now requesting a loan, with which to buy agricultural supplies to keep their crops healthy and be able in the end to offer a good product.

","en":"Gulsara is a kind and happy woman.  She is 56 years old and lives in a rural area in the J. Rasulov district. Unfortunately, Gulsara is a widow and lost her husband several years ago.  She has four children.  The children are already grown and have their own families.  The children try to help their mother, but Gulsara also does not sit with her hands down.  She is a very diligent and hardworking woman.  She was very lonely after her husband's death, and her children supported her in everything.  Gulsara wants to educate her grandsons and is saving money for this.  Gulsara is involved in animal husbandry.  She fattens up cattle.  She has been in this business for 10 years.  She buys 1-2 year-old livestock, fattens them up for 3-4 months and sells them to butchers.  She likes her business very much and has a very good income from it.  Gulsara plans to buy livestock and resell it by the end of spring when livestock prices go up.  She requested this loan and wants to use the loan to buy livestock.  Gulsara hopes very much that she will be helped at Arvand and that she will realize her plans and educate her grandsons."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1528562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

As a little girl it was very dangerous and her parents could not accompany her since they had a low income and both had to work to put food on the table.  She is single and has a son who works in a hardware store.  He helps her out with household expenses.  They live together with Zoila's mother.\r\n\r\nZoila is a homemaker and also has a sewing business in her free time to make extra income to help her son cover the household expenses.  She works at home so she can do both the housework and sewing at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy cement, iron, sand and bricks and to hire a worker to build a kitchen.  The one she has now is inside the house and makes things too uncomfortable.  Building a new one will give her more space at home and allow her to cook more openly, improving hygiene.\r\n\r\nZoila hopes that with the help of the loan she can finish her kitchen and do away with the problems of having the living room, bedroom and kitchen inside the house.  She hopes her son will get a university degree so he can get a better job than the one he has."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1522276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She could not study because she lacked the financial resources and also because of the distance between her home and the school. Berta is now married and her husband works on a farm cutting, cleaning and pruning coffee. She has four children but only three live with her as the older one is married. Of the three children who live with her, one is 21 years old and graduated as an accountant last year, the other is 15 years old and is in Year 7 and the youngest, a boy, is nine years old and in Grade 3. Berta\u2019s home is made up of her husband and her children.\r\n\r\nBerta works in agriculture and also works on the farm cleaning and cutting coffee. She has worked in agriculture since her childhood, because as they had a lack of financial resources she had to help with the household costs. In order for her parents to send her siblings to school, she was unable to go to school, but she did want her siblings to study and get the education that she missed out on. Berta\u2019s job is a 40 minute walk from home. She has to get up very early to feed her children and then go out to work. When she comes home in the afternoon she has to do the household tasks. \r\n\r\nWith this loan Berta can buy sand and cement to build a wall.

She lives with her two children in the city of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. It is a city on the coastal region with a pleasant climate. It is a very commercial city, considered to be the land port between the sierra and the coast. \r\n\r\nThirteen years ago, Carmen's husband immigrated to another country and never came back. Since then, Carmen had to get her two children ahead. She started to sell clothes to neighbors and later grew her business little by little. Now she sells cosmetics too. Carmen is a hardworking woman who has even taken cooking classes given by the city. Thanks to that, he learned a lot and she also offers her food preparation services for special events. \r\n\r\nCarmen learned about Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa three years ago when she received a group loan. Now Carmen asked for an individual loan, which she will invest in buying cosmetics and clothing. The Carnaval season is coming and it is very good for sales. Carmen's dream is that in the not so distant future she can open her own locale to sell products and handmade crafts that she does in her free time.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.

Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan.  She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLudy hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. \r\n\r\nEach farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.  Felix is a reliable member of the community. He is married with five children.  Felix is 45 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last five years to support his family.  In addition to this, Felix is involved in the prayer group.  He described his harvest last year as one not with One Acre Fund.  He hopes that as a One Acre Fund farmer he is able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers that have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program! \r\n\r\nFelix is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rain season.  Felix joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative.  Felix plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Felix\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training. \r\n\r\nFelix and the Bidii farmers Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund prepurchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.

Do\u00f1a Martha se ha dedicado a este rubro desde hace 4 a\u00f1os ya que este tipo de actividad viene de generaciones, el grano de caf\u00e9 lo vende por medio de intermediarios ya que as\u00ed se evitan hacer el gasto de trasladarlo a las bodegas en donde es almacenado y vendido. Sus cultivos est\u00e1n ubicados aproximadamente a un kil\u00f3metro de distancia desde su casa de habitaci\u00f3n al cual se trasladan en autob\u00fas de ruta de la zona.\nSu mayor meta es que sus hijos obtengan un mejor patrimonio dejando un techo digno y tierras para que las puedan trabajar.

She is a single mother to three children who are underage and study at a school in the community. They live with her and her parents. As a family they work sowing and growing coffee and staple crops on a small scale which help her to support her family and sometimes to sell part of her produce. \r\n\r\nMartha has worked in this area for four years as this work has been handed down over the generations. The coffee beans are sold through intermediaries because in this way she avoids the cost of transporting the beans to warehouses where they are stored and sold. Her crops are located approximately one kilometer away from her home which she is able to get to by taking the local bus.\r\n\r\nMartha\u2019s main goal is for her children to inherit a better life by leaving them with a decent roof over their heads and land that they can work.

Helma has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. \r\n\r\nHelma is a reliable member of the community. She is married and has 5 children. Helma is 48 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 20 years to support her family. In addition to this, Helma is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group and burial committee. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages. \r\n\r\nHelma is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Helma joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices and learn new farming methods. She likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the word about One Acre Fund farmers. Helma has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. In the future, Helma hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school and invest in a business. \r\n\r\nHelma's Group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers' harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.

support with each other. In each weekly meeting, they emphasize the confidence, accountability and adherence to training that they have been receiving from ID-Ghana. Their goal is to continue together for many more loan cycles and maintain an excellent credit record. In addition, they are gaining a lot of useful knowledge each week with the ID-Ghana Loan Officer, who presents various educational training on relevant and useful themes like financial management, nutrition and health. It is the combination of the loans and education that makes the Micro Credit Program of ID-Ghana so useful to Peace group members.\r\n\r\nAugustin is a vehicle spare parts dealer and has been doing this job for six years. He is 40 years old, married and has one child. He is a tenant in Dansoman.

She was born in Bogota and grew up in the town of Tolima.  She is the mother of four children, is very enterprising, and has many desires for getting ahead.\r\n\r\nSandra has been living in Bogota for 18 years and adopted this city when she left her native town.  Since then, Sandra has strived to make her dreams a reality, but she has seen them derail because of the economic conditions under which she lives.  She has always wanted to become a professional, but it has not been possible. \r\n\r\nToday Sandra lives under the same economic conditions but the opportunity she has gotten from a quality institute of higher education has allowed her to restart her goals and she continues to dream about getting ahead and train in a profession that she loves, health care.

Homa Bay county is located in southwestern Kenya, and borders onto Lake Victoria, the second-largest lake in the world. Populations are dense close to the lake, where many individuals make their living from fishing, and a few work in the small but slowly growing tourism industry. A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nClement is married and has seven children. He is a retired teacher, while his wife is a farmer. She has been farming for 15 years now, and she is currently growing sunflower, maize and sorghum on their farm. Clement is excited about beekeeping, as it will provide him with honey for medicinal use.\r\n\r\nThis is Clement\u2019s first loan with Honey Care, and he intends to use the proceeds from his beehives to start a small business and pay school fees for his children.

Homa Bay county is located in southwestern Kenya, and borders onto Lake Victoria, the second-largest lake in the world. Populations are dense close to the lake, where many individuals make their living from fishing, and a few work in the small but slowly growing tourism industry. A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nPeter is married and has twenty children. He is a para-vet (animal health worker) and he also provides beekeeping services. His wife is a fish monger. They have a farm where they have been farming for twenty-five years now, and they are currently growing watermelon, paw paws, beans, green grams, pumpkins, sunflowers, maize, millet and they are also keeping dairy goats. Peter is excited about beekeeping, as it an enterprise that is simple and less involving, and it will provide him with honey for medicinal use as well.\r\n\r\nThis is Peter\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and he intends to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children and buy books and school uniforms for them.

Homa Bay county is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflowers, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.\r\n\r\nMishael is married and has four children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for four years now and they are currently growing mangoes, pawpaw, citrus fruits, avocado, maize, beans, millet and trees like croton (a deciduous tree, indigenous of Uganda). Mishael is excited about beekeeping as it will earn him extra income and provide him with honey for food.\r\n\r\nThis is Mishael\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and he intends to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children and to buy more beehives.

After finishing secondary school, she began to work as an assistant at a beauty salon.

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped.  Inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet.  They also grow drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. \r\n\r\nAlthough beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.\r\n\r\nWilliam is married and has five children.

This is his first loan with Kiva and he will use it to finish setting up running water at his house. He is about to finish construction and it takes a lot of work to transport water, either for construction purposes or simply to have drinkable water. With running water, he will be able to have a toilet, a shower, and a kitchen basin, and this will make his life and that of his family much more comfortable. He has to do this himself because, for several reasons, the area where he lives does not have basic infrastructure. This will not stop Orlando from having drinkable water at his house.

She has a partner and they have two children who are underage and live with them. She makes sweetcorn tamales and takes care of the children. When she turned ten, she started helping her mother and learned how to make tamales that way. She has been selling tamales for four years. Her partner is employed at a baker's. She will use the loan to buy a motorcycle for her partner's use. He needs it to go to work, since he works in the city of San Miguel.

She and her husband are raising four daughters.  Their two older daughters are university students while the other two are still in school.  Tynchtykan's husband works as a foreman in a private construction company.  Tynchtykan herself has a specialized-secondary education.  After graduation, she enrolled in a healthcare institute.  She successfully completed her degree and then worked as a temporary employee at a local hospital until 1993.  In 1993, she and her husband started their own business selling staple goods such as food and washing products, using 20,000 som (KGS) as a starting capital.  They were able to develop their business and attract regular customers.  \n\nTynchtykan now makes an average monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  With the money the couple made from their business, they were able to buy some livestock.  Tynchtykan now owns one dairy cow, 1 heifer and 5 sheep, as well as 0,80 hectare of land on which she grows potatoes, corn, sunflower and vegetables.\n\nEager to further expand and develop her retail business, she has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan.  She will use her loan to buy bulk quantities of staple goods, for further resale, on a retail-basis, to the local residents.  Tynchtykan is planning to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her sales.  She is also planning to save enough money to send her daughters to university.\n\n\n \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1538237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy staple goods for her retail business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bakai-Ata, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-02-28T17:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-30T17:00:04Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.27,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tynchtykan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12767.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440472},{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":12767.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578292},{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":12767.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579488894},{"amount":234.48,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12767.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.27,"payment_id":595436085}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T18:55:12Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:32:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":676343,"name":"Safina Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Faida est une femme dynamique, pr\u00e9sidente du groupe de credit Safina.

Nansalmaa is reaching her fifties, and she doesn't want to live in an uncomfortable and cold place. This loan is very important to her as old people are more vulnerable to the cold.

Unfortunately he was not able to study at school as it was very difficult to pay for when he was a child. Apolinar has five children with his wife - four are married while the youngest daughter still lives at home. Apolinar works in farming while his wife makes grass mats. Their daughter who still lives at home is a seamstress.\r\n\r\nApolinar has made a living growing corn and beans since he was very young. He learned this trade from his parents, who did the same work. It is the most common job in the area where Apolinar lives.\r\n\r\nApolinar walks for an hour and a half in order to get to work. He works from 6am until 4pm.\r\n\r\nApolinar needs to finish building his house and so is applying for a loan in order to buy bricks, iron and wood, and to pay labourers. He is confident that this loan will be granted but, if not, he will do everything he can to finish the house on his own.\r\n\r\nApolinar dreams of improving his house and of it lasting for many years to come. He hopes to leave the house to his youngest daughter so that she can live with her own family there

She has a high school education and is very responsible, sociable and cheerful. She earns money through farming and animal husbandry, which she started 29 years ago when she purchased livestock for 10,000 som. Thanks to her hard work, Jumagul currently has one dairy cow and 19 sheep. She earns 8,000 som per month from milk and crop sales. She has a 2.0 hectare plot of land where she mainly grows beans, which she sells wholesale. In order to expand her farm, Jumagul applied for a loan with Bai-Tushum and Partners to buy cows for breeding. The cows will stay on their own farmstead, supervised by a herdsman in the summer. She plans to use the profits to invest in additional livestock and to save money to expand her barn.

In total, he cultivates approximately 4 acres of cacao trees that provide him a yield of 90 lbs. per week. \r\n\r\nAlfonso stated that his previous loan assisted him in having his farm properly cleaned. Due to his age and inability to move, he pays workers to generally clean and prune his cacao farm. He has seen a major improvement, with high-yielding production.\r\n\r\nAlfonso is asking for the assistance of another loan to hire workers to properly keep his cacao farm generally clean. His wife Isabella enjoys harvesting when the farm is properly underbrushed.\r\n\r\nThe couple lives happily on the farm with their daughter, who is assisting them with harvesting and other day-to-day operations.
