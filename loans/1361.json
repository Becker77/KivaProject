She requested for a loan through the group to add to her working capital so as to increase her cash flow. She will use the rest of the money to pay school fees for her children and buy them a few basic needs. Her customers are people around the centre who buy her items especially for home consumption.

Like many women she became a mother at a very young age, unintentionally, but thankfully her parents and other close family members supported her.  She made mistakes in her eagerness to live her life, but these mistakes shaped her into the person she is now, a person who never gave up dreaming.  She knew that whatever she set herself to do she would achieve, not only for her own well-being, but also for the well-being of her family and for the people who have always believed in her.  \r\n\r\nThis is why she decided to go back to school without a second thought.  Learning was what she had always wanted and she finally took that step.  She knows it won't be easy, but it won't be impossible either, since once again she has the support of the people who love her and believe in her, and she knows that with CampoAlto everything will be more within reach.  She hopes to finish what she started, since setbacks and mistakes will make her stronger and help her to grow more.  The arrangement with Kiva would be a big help for her in finishing her program, especially now that monthly payments are increasing a little.

Guljar has a higher education. She graduated from an institute with a degree in industrial engineering. Her professional career began in a district food franchise, then she got married but continued to work.  By nature, Guljar is very responsible, communicative and cheerful. Together with her husband, Guljar practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 15 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Guljar's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 1 calf, and 15 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  She also works a 2.40 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans and perennial grasses. The collected harvest is sold to wholesale suppliers.  For the purpose of further developing her agriculture business, Guljar turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy bulls to increase the size of her herd. Guljar plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to buy household

Benard described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group. \r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Benard\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He first joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. As an active member in his community, Benard also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member. Benard plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from harvest, was able to save money and feed the family. Benard also joined One Acre Fund because he wanted to eliminate hunger in his home. \r\n\r\nBenard and the Bidii Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.

husband, is raising three children. Gulmira has a secondary education. She started her professional career working in a pharmacy, but she currently practices crop farming and livestock breeding. She started this business 14 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulmira's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 2 bull calves, and 10 sheep on her farm, as well as a 1.11 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows potatoes, beans and perennial grasses for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulmira turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy mineral fertilizers as she needs to prepare the land, as well as pay for tractor services for tilling, harrowing, cultivating and sowing. Gulmira plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

She completed primary education thanks to her parents' financial and moral support. She appreciates the support they have given her for all these years. \r\n\r\nFrom her marriage she has one young son. He studies at the community school with the financial support from her agricultural work and her husband's income. Her husband works in the industrial manufacturing zone in order to generate more income for his family. \r\n\r\nFor the past 3 years her coffee crops have been generating most of the income for the family because the options for employment in this region are not very good. While her husband is away, her parents help her with the cleaning, application of manure, and other tasks, while she waits for her husband to return home on the weekends.\r\n\r\nHer plan for the future is to renovate her house because it is currently made of adobe.

The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. \r\n\r\nGrace is 55 years old and has been a farmer for 15 years. Grace works as a farmer to provide for her six children. The community and other farmers know Grace as friendly, hardworking, and trustworthy. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community, such as the women's group and prayer group. Grace described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nGrace is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Grace joined One Acre Fund in order to get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member and wants to help more farmers. Grace plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school and invest in a business. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Grace\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training and was able to feed the family. \r\n\r\nGrace and the Amani Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

Kiva's help is fundamental because with a lower payment schedule he can finance transportation, clothing and other requirements for practices and this subsidy would be really helpful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1536232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-01T03:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-31T03:50:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":153380.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882839},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":306761.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202204},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":153380.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286345},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":153380.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225052}],"funded_date":"2014-03-01T07:14:36Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":676771,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a small scale farmer living in Nkubu area of Eastern Kenya.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of fifty-three individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Wekesa has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\n Wekesa is married and has ten children. He is 60-years-old and is known as friendly, hardworking and trustworthy. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Wekesa has been a farmer for twenty years. He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. Wekesa first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Wekesa joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Wekesa plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home and save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Wekesa\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from the harvest, able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\n Wekesa and the Best Home Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.

In farming, she loves dairy farming, which helps to pay for her children's school fees. Her biggest challenge is insufficient rain, which causes insufficient animal feed.\r\n\r\nJoyce chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer a favorable interest rate on their loans. During the training, she learned more on how to develop a savings culture.

She's the single mother of four children.  One daughter is already married and the other three live with her.  Only two of them are going to school.  Nobody else lives with them.\r\n\r\nDinora's a hardworking woman who has made a living selling pupusas and atol [a corn beverage] for three years.  The need to get ahead is what brought Dinora to look for a way to earn money.  Previously she worked in the home, but unfortunately her husband died and she had to find a job to support her children on her own.  A friend encouraged her to make pupusas and atol, and this is how she came to work in that business.\r\n\r\nDinora gets up at 4 a.m. to make the atol; at 6 she goes out to make door-to-door sales in the nearby communities, returning at 9.  In the afternoon she sells pupusas, starting at 3 p.m. and ending at 6:30.  That's her daily routine, but she says she does it with pleasure because her dream is for her daughters to go to school.\r\n\r\nDinora needs the loan she's requesting form CrediCampo to change the roof of her house.  The metal isn't any good and it leaks when it rains.  She needs help to ensure her family's safety.\r\n\r\nHer hopes for the future are for her daughters to go to college and to build another bedroom to improve her house.  She also dreams of putting in a restaurant.  She hopes to achieve her dreams by saving her

","en":"Tcveta is 63 years old and married.  She and her husband have raised seven children.  All their children have now left home and started their own families.  However, Tcveta still cares for four of her grandchildren who were left orphans after their mother (Tcveta's daughter-in-law) died during childbirth.  Tcevta's husband, who is retired, helps her to take care of the grandchildren and to run the farm.  Tcveta has a teaching degree and worked for 30 years in a school.  She is now involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides the main source of income for the family.  She started in this business 11 years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 14,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to many years of hard work, Tcveta now owns three dairy cows, one horse and six sheep.

With the previous loans, all of which she paid back successfully, Sore bought drinks, such as beer and soft drinks, and clothes. Sore has managed to earn extra income which she uses to cover transportation costs for her business as well as school fees and home expenses. Sore would like to expand her business so it has high sales. She will share this loan with her loan group \"MAFANIKIO\" which has three members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

live in an eight-bedroom apartment in Bamenda, Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges in life, among which are inadequate finances to properly manage her business, paying for her children's education, being unable to provide a square meal to her family, and the death of her family members.\r\n\r\nWith the new loan requested, she will buy foodstuff from bush markets such as plantains, potatoes, cocoyam, garri, and provision store items. Also she will invest part of the loan in agriculture--that is, she will buy seedlings, pay for labour, and the income will go to the running of the business. She holds a positive view for her business succeeding because she has been doing it for a long time and as such has experience in the field.

district of Jalpaiguri. She lives there in their own small kachha house (made of bamboo, straw and mud) with her husband and two children (one son and one daughter). The children attend school, and both are in grade 7. Both Minu and her husband are illiterate and can sign their names only.\n\nMinu's husband, Jayanta, 55 years, is associated with agricultural activities. He is the only earning member in the family. He works hard on his agricultural land. Minu also helps her husband in his work. They sell the products in the local market and somehow manage the family expenses. \n\nBut, they cannot provide their children with enough education equipment. Their daughter, Jayadevi, is in grade 7. She is a very intelligent girl, hardworking and dedicated fully in her studies. She wants to study uninterruptedly, and aims to be a doctor.

She wants to do a job after her graduation to help her parents financially.  But she cannot get the necessary educational supplies and private tuition because of her parent's poor financial resources.\r\n\r\nSahijan heard about BJS and has taken a loan from them.

Farah has been running a vocational training center for the past five years. She provides the facility for different types of trainings of home economics to women. She also contributes her income with her husband to manage the household.\r\n\r\nFarah needs to buy some furniture and other accessories for her training center to provide better facilities for training but due to some financial constraints she is not in the position to buy all of these items. Therefore, she has requested a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\nThis loan will enable her to buy furniture and accessories for her business. This will also be helpful for her to earn a favorable income to meet her regular expenditures in the business.\r\n\r\nFarah is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

She received only a little education due to her family problems and her husband is also illiterate and can only sign his name. Sahera's son is now in grade 9 while her daughter is in grade 7. Sahera herself is a housewife so she has to look after all the household matters including her children\u2019s education. Her husband is a farmer, cultivating different kinds of vegetables and crops and selling them at the local rural market for income. As his income is very inconsistent, he is unable to cover the family expenses, so Sahera is interested in making her children eligible to help their father in his work.\r\n\r\nSahera's younger daughter Mini is a very intelligent student and has been coming in first in her class exams for five years. Sahera inspires her to do still better in the higher exams but she is unable to buy her textbooks for each subject and pay her school fees, tuition fees, etc., due to their poverty. Now Sahera has applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to help her in solving these serious problems. She hopes she will be able to make Mini competent in her education with this loan money by giving her full support such as books, pens, copies, guidebooks, etc., whatever is needed. This support will help them to do well in future.\r\n\r\nSahera and Mini (as seen in the photo) gladly thank BJS and Kiva equally for funding.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1529314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

years old.  Her parents had very limited financial resources and a large family with many responsibilities and a lot of work, so they did not see the need for their children to attend school and prepare themselves.  Her husband works as a fisherman.  They have four children.  The oldest did not want to continue school and preferred to work with his father as a farmer.  The other two children attend secondary school at the school in the community.\r\n\r\nMaria works selling fish and vegetables.  She has been doing this work since she was young since her mother did the same type of work.  When she married, it was not difficult to help with the family expenses.  She waits for the fish her husband catches at night and in the morning, sells it at a specific place or walks to bring it to where the customer wants it.  She also sells vegetables when there is no fish to sell.

They live in their own house.\r\n\r\nMaya`s husband has been in this agricultural business for many years.  He has got a lot of valuable experience that gives him an opportunity always to obtain the best harvests. The land he cultivates is located in a rich agricultural area near his house.  He sells his produce in all the neighbouring areas, and he has many customers because people know that every thing he sells is of the highest quality and is available at affordable prices.  He is an enterprising man and is very much dedicated to his work.  Of late his family expenses and his children's educational costs have increased a lot, so in order to increase his income he has decided to grow his agricultural business by cultivating potatoes.\r\n\r\nMaya has taken a loan from BJS to buy potato seeds and fertilizers.  They hope to earn more profit from this, as this product has a great demand in the market. They hope that they will be able to cover their family expenses and educational expenses and at the same time bring greater economic security to their home.\r\n\r\nMaya aspires to purchase a auto-rickshaw in future with the profit.\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to BJS and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1529342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase potato seeds and fertilizers for potato cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-03-01T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-31T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-02T22:11:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":675980,"name":"Shehnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shehnaz is 35 years old.

Therefore, she has applied for a Kiva loan. With the help of this loan she can enable herself to buy all these things for her business purposes and she can also earn maximum profitable income.

She worked there as an employee in different restaurants, where she gained experience and knowledge about the management of that type of business.

Four moths ago, she moved again to the city and had the opportunity to acquire a locale located in a commercial area of the neighborhood where she lives. She is remodeling it and has acquired some assets, but she needs to buy a refrigerator and the necessary ingredients (vegetables, grains, salt, meat) to start producing and generate income to help her husband support the home.

He earns a reasonable income for his entire family. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning he was purchasing small quantities of beef from the market and selling them for very reasonable rates in his town from his butcher shop. The customers were upset by stale beef for many days and he does not want to compromise his reputation and the quality of his product. This is the reason he wants to produce fresh beef and wants to buy a bull calf for producing more beef to sell. Unfortunately, he does not have enough cash in hand.\r\nFor this reason, he contacted BRAC Pakistan, a Kiva field partner. After understanding all of the procedures, he has requested a Kiva loan so that he can buy a bull calf. \r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will prove productive and beneficial for his butcher shop.

He owns a bangles and cosmetics store in his community market. His elder son helps him in the business, while the rest of his children are studying in school. He sells beautiful, attractive and colorful bangles and a variety of facial creams and shampoos in his shop. \r\n\r\nNasir has a friendly nature and he loves to work hard. Currently he is in need of purchasing more colorful bangles and facial creams for his shop.

He speaks with a monotonous tone which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of others.\r\n\r\nDue to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town and that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relations, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Kalsoom requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits, etc.\r\n\r\nKalsoom thanks Kiva and field partner

He is a scrap dealer, which is a very successful business for his family. He is an active borrower of BRAC Pakistan. He is currently in need of purchasing some products for his shop.

He is responsible for his spouse, a daughter and old parents. \r\n\r\nHe is a milkman by profession and sells milk in his community from his motorbike. He has been selling milk since 1997, so he is very expert and experienced in his profession. He is expert in producing milk from a buffalo. He gets milk from all his buffaloes in no time. He has many buffaloes, and this is the reason he has to do very hard work to feed them. Every day he takes his buffaloes to the pasture for grazing and gives them a bath in the stream. He has to stay the whole day with his buffaloes due to fear of theft.\r\n\r\nHe wants to appoint an assistant to look after his herd but he does not earn enough profit to afford an assistant's salary. M. Sadiq is taking a 2nd loan. He invested his previous loan in the same business. With the help of his last loan he purchased a buffalo and has been getting benefits from that buffalo. He wants to continue to establish his business and wants to buy an additional buffalo so that he could increase his herd and his monthly income.

She is very impressed by this honorable support and would like to take more loans after she pays back this one.

He sells cold drinks and spicy chaat (a highly popular Indian snack made mainly of crisp fried Indian bread pieces in combination with vegetables and a variety of sweet and sour spicy Indian sauces).\r\n\r\nNaheed's husband wants to purchase ingredients of spicy chaat, e.g., potatoes, onions, chaat masala powder and yogurt, etc. However, due to insufficient financial means he is unable to purchase these items. Therefore Naheed has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan her husband can easily purchase these items for his business, and he can earn the maximum profitable income.

He is making an effort and earning money for the survival of his family.\r\n \r\nHe wants to buy goats to sell at Eid-ul-Azha festival. Many people like to buy goats to immolate on Eid-Ul-Azha. This is very profitable but he does not have enough cash in hand to buy the goats.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Kalsoom has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can buy goats to sell.

She is a rural housewife aged 35 years. She is married to Amal who is 39 years old.  They are blessed with three sons. Jamuna is illiterate and her husband has a primary education. They live in the small village of Khagrabari in the district Jalpaiguri. Two of Jamuna's sons are school-going and are in grade 6 and grade 5. The third one is below the school-going age.\r\n\r\nJamuna's husband is associated with agricultural business, but his income is too low to cover the household expenses. Whatever he earns is spent on family expenses, so he finds it difficult to cover the cost of their children's education. Jamuna is not able to pay their fees. Because of this, her children sometimes feel quite uncomfortable going to school.\r\n\r\nJamuna always tries to promote the well-being of her children and their education.  Her son Milon is in grade 6.  He is not only meritorious but studious too.  But he needs guidance in his studies.  So Jamuna is accessing this loan from BJS (Kiva's partner).  With the help of the education loan she will pay for her son's school fees, textbooks, and stationery, private tuition fees and other necessary expenses.\r\n\r\nShe and her son (in the picture) are very much grateful to BJS and Kiva and give their hearty thanks for the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1530197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"To purchase essential educational materials for her son.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-03-01T15:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-31T15:50:11Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamuna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-01T21:34:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":676114,"name":"Niamat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Niamat lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

Her husband is a farmer by trade. Both she and her husband are illiterate, only able to sign their names, but their only daughter is studying in class X (grade 10) now. Though Purnima is illiterate she knows the utility of education and so she was not to be reluctant to give education to her daughter.\r\n\r\nAt present the problem arises when her husband, being a farmer, is unable to cover her daughter\u2019s educational expenses. As her daughter Tapashi is a meritorious student, she did not take any outside help for her studies before, but now she needs some private tuition, reference books, notes, etc., for her coming examinations. Purnima is helpless to manage the household expenses, yet she is unable to handle the educational expenses also. This creates a great pressure on her mind.

Baldha is located 70 miles away from the district headquarters Balangir. All the thirteen members of this group have different types of micro-enterprises like general store, tailoring, procuring seasonal argil products, tea stall, Tiffin center, etc.  Purnima is one of the members of this group who is sitting on the extreme right with raised hand in the first row of the photo. She is a very confident young lady.  She is 28 years old, living with her husband, two sons of eight and two years, one daughter of six years and her mother-in-law in a small house. \r\n\r\nPurnima has been running a tailoring unit with one sewing machine in her house for the last five years. Apart from this she also manages a small general store simultaneously. Her husband does private medical practice along with a screen printing unit in the village. Purnima earns a monthly income of 4000 INR from the above businesses which is very little to manage her family expenses with the educational expenses of her two children. To overcome this financial trouble, Purnima wants to earn some more income by expanding her tailoring and grocery shop businesses. So from a part of this loan she wants to buy a pico (sewing) machine and from another part buy grocery items like sugar, soap, tea, biscuits, shampoo, etc. She hopes this investment will help her to increase their income. Purnima hopes to save enough to give better education to her children and repair her house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1532041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing a pico machine for tailoring center and sugar, soap, tea, biscuits, shampoo, etc. for grocery store to generate more income to educate her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BALDHA, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-03-01T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-31T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harapriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tikeswari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ghasien","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuntala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bipasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belamati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumisuta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":176000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-11T19:49:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":676154,"name":"Asma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asma is a thirty-year-old married woman who lives in the area of Lahore, Pakistan along with her family.

For a long time after her husband's death, Kulumkan couldn't cope with the loss of someone so dear to her.  But she had to raise her children and get them standing on their own feet, so she took the responsibility for her household and material well-being into her own hands.

is a 59-year-old resident of the Rudaki district. She is the mother of two sons, ages 23 and 21, who are busy studying. She cares a great deal about her children's education. Malika's husband works in Russia. He does not forget about his loved ones and continues to support them. Malika is a teacher at the local school and has taught kids for 18 years, working with them and leading them down the right path.

district in Odisha, India. Baldha village is located at a distance of 110 kilometers from the district Head Quarters of Balangir. Debaki lives with her husband. She has one son who is 16 years old and one daughter who is 14 years old and both are continuing their studies. Debaki has been running a bicycle repair center for the last 10 years with the help of her husband. Her husband repairs bicycles and sells bicycle spare parts to the customers at a reasonable rate. He has very good technical skills in his occupation and his customers from the nearby villages trust him very much. He brings cycle spare parts thrice a month from the nearby town of Khariar, which is 6 km. from the village. From the present business, Debaki earns 200 INR per day, which is hand-to-mouth for her. Due to this situation, until now she has not been able to construct a good house for her family.  So these poor situations compel Debaki to search for a credit source for the expansion of her business. To fulfill her dream, in January 2014 Debaki, along with 13 other women in her village formed a Self Help Group named Maa Bimala and applied for a loan from KIVA partner Mahashakti Foundation for further expansion of her husband\u2019s business. She will use the loan to buy bicycle repair tools and spare parts in larger quantities, which will help her to provide better services to her clients and increase her profits. Debaki hopes to build a permanent cycle repair cabin in her village.\r\n\r\nThe other 13 members of the group are also involved in small enterprises and service work like a milk business, bakery, fabrication work, vegetable cultivation, cloth vending, sweet item making and selling, leaf plate making and selling, auto repairing,  bore well digging etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1533268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase bicycle repair tools and spare parts ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BALDHA, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-03-01T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-31T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jemadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pratima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minakumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shushama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tribeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nisamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bijayashri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-05T18:40:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":674829,"name":"Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pedro tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa e hijos en el distrito de Pomahuaca, una comunidad de clima caluroso, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica  a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda, ubicada en la Provincia de Ja\u00e9n que pertenece a la Regi\u00f3n Cajamarca, sierra norte del Per\u00fa.\n<P>\nEl se dedica a la agricultura especialmente al cultivo de arroz, dedic\u00e1ndose a este rubro desde hace 14 a\u00f1os por lo que cuenta con experiencia, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo a Edpyme Alternativa de 1 500 nuevo soles para la compra de abonos para su cultivo de arroz y de esta manera tener una producci\u00f3n oportuna para ofrecer a sus clientes y de esta manera generar mayores ingresos para su familia.\n","en":"Pedro is 57 years old.

called Jurabandh in the Balangir district of Odisha, India formed a Self Help Group (SHG) named Maa Bastren-A with the objective of expanding their existing businesses by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Mamata, a most active and energetic lady of 30 years who is standing in front with her hand raised in the photo is one of them. She is a cheerful lady with high ambition. Her family consists of her husband, one son age six and two daughters who are twelve and ten years old.\r\n\r\nFor the last 10 years, Mamata has been running a clothing vending business with the help and support of her husband. She and her husband purchase ready-made garments from a wholesale market 100 kilometers away from her village. Her husband moves to different villages and weekly markets on a bike to sell the garments. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from her existing business. But the present income is not sufficient to manage the business expenses as well as the household expenses for her family. So Mamata wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. With the present loan of 16,000 INR, she is planning to purchase some quality fancy garments for selling.

Nurila has a high school education and earns her family's main income through animal husbandry. She started in the livestock business 6 years ago when she purchased cattle for 10,000 som. Thanks to her hard work, Nurila now has 4 dairy cows, 1 mare, 5 goats, and a 3.5 hectare plot of land for planting barley, wheat, potatoes and hay. She earns 10,000 som per month. In order to expand her farm, Nurila asked Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cows to fatten and sell at the market for a profit.

active women entrepreneurs from Juarbandh village in Bolangir district in Odisha, India to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing businesses. Nirupama is one of them. The lady standing in front with her hand raised in the photograph is Nirupama. She is a very active lady of 29 years who lives with her husband, one son who is seven years old and one daughter who is four years old. Both are studying in school.\r\n \r\nNirupama has been running a screen printing unit in her house with the help of her husband for the last eight years. She takes orders for printing of invitation cards and supplies ready made invitation cards to the customers. Her husband purchases the materials like chemicals, paper, color etc. from the nearest wholesale market, which is 40 kilometers away. Her screen printing center has name and fame in the locality for its timely delivery and quality work. Her daily net income in the marriage season (December-June) is 500 INR and in the normal season is 200 INR. But in the present market context, this income is not sufficient for her to manage the household and other expenses. Nirupama is a hard working woman and she wants to expand her business. So with the present loan, she wants to purchase cards, colors and chemicals in bulk to reduce the purchasing cost as she replenishes her stock frequently. Nirupama hopes to educate her children and construct a good house. Like Nirupama, the other 10 members of the group are doing cotton cultivation, vegetable cultivation, a fancy store, a general grocery shop, a Tiffin stall, a tailoring center etc. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1536118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase cards, colors and chemicals in bulk for screen printing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"JURABANDH,BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-03-01T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-31T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nirupama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kiamati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kousalya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chubani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalindri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bimala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sapura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kshira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":164000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":164000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T20:28:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":676847,"name":"Anwar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anwar was born in 1991.

teacher at a high school in the Rudaki district. She lives there with her two sons and daughters-in-law. Her sons are engaged in trade activities and their wives help Soatposho at home. Because teacher salaries are small, she also works as a seamstress and sews traditional dresses to order. Many women in Tajikistan wear both casual and dressy traditional clothing, so many girls and women also learn to sew in order to offer their services sewing traditional clothing. Soatposho is no exception. She wants to take out a loan to buy a new sewing machine because hers is completely outdated and often breaks. She hopes for support so that she will be able to buy a sewing machine and continue working.

Odisha, India. In this ward most of the residents are from the poor community. The people of Mahar community (weavers of bamboo crafts) are among them. They reside in small huts and their children rarely get good education. The main business of this community is making hand fans of bamboo and selling them in the market and supplying them to traders. The income they get from this is hand-to-mouth for them. Rama, aged about 51, is a woman from this community. She is sitting in the middle in the photo with raised hand.  She is married and lives with her husband, one daughter of 11 and two sons of 15 and 13 years \r\n\r\nRama is doing her traditional work of bamboo hand fan making and marketing. Rama and her husband together do the processing work and make hand fans. They procure the raw bamboo from a distance of 100 kms. Her husband goes by train to bring back the material. Both the wife and husband sell the finished products in the town market. Apart from making hand fans, Rama also procures finished products from the neighbors and sells them in bulk to the traders from other places.\r\n\r\nRama earns a monthly income of Rs.4,000 from this business. According to Rama, this small income is not at all sufficient to meet the requirements of her family. In this situation she was in search of a credit source, and Mahashakti came to work in the same area. Along with the other 12 members, Rama formed a Self Help Group named Gruhalaxmi and accessed a loan of 12,000 INR. From this loan she is planning to purchase more raw bamboo for working for a longer period to raise her production and earn more income and also purchase finished products to supply. \r\n\r\nRama hopes to construct a house and provide better education to her children and lead a prestigious life. The other twelve members of this group are Lalita, Kunti, Kandari, Teja, Rajkumari, Dripadi, Prabhasini, Sarita, Nilendri, Sibani, Santi and Lakshmi and they are doing different types of micro enterprises like general store, vegetable vending, fast food centre, home shopping, cycle store, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1540843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy more raw bamboo and finished products for added income to construct a better house and educate her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-03-01T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-31T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kandari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajkumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daipadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prabhasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilendri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sibani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":156000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-04T18:29:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":676853,"name":"Laban","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laban is 49 years old and from Nyahururu.

","en":"Gulumkan is 54 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising four children. Gulumkan has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Gulumkan practices livestock breeding. She started this business 21 years ago, with an initial purchase of livestock in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulumkan's hard work, she currently has 2 horses on her farm. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS).

As the main source of income for her family, Nursuluu, along with her husband Asanbek, practices livestock breeding and crop farming.  She started this business 14 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 17,000 som (KGS). The farm is flourishing and abundant to this day. Thanks to Nursuluu's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 1 bull and 20 sheep on her farm, as well as a 2.40 hectare plot of irrigated land on which she grows beans every year. Nursuluu's husband earns extra money seasonally as a private builder on construction sites. Their monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Nursuluu turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy bull calves to increase the size of her herd. Nursuluu plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

The lady standing with her hand raised in the picture is Milita. Milita is 36 years old and lives with her husband and her three children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in the activity of cultivation for a long time. \r\n\r\nShe got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighborhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took over the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. Initially, she started growing only a few vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes and onions, but later on she grew bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumbers, ladyfingers (okra) and brinjal (eggplant). She has a very good relationship with her customers, as the vegetables she sells are fresh.\r\n\r\nNow she has a new idea to rent some more land for cultivation so that she can grow more vegetables on a larger scale. For this reason, she has requested a loan. She will use the loan to purchase pesticides, seeds and fertilizers, and to pay rent for additional land.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1541030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase pesticides, seeds and fertilizers, and to pay rent for additional land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Semliguda, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-03-01T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-03-31T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nirmala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naliniprabha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Namramani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Swarnamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anupama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarojini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T02:39:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":675055,"name":"Abigail Keila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Abigail tiene 23 a\u00f1os, ella se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo, ella ofrece sus productos visitando distintas zonas y oficinas de la zona de Pampahasi donde vive, tambi\u00e9n los que la conocen le hacen pedidos,  este te pr\u00e9stamo es su primera secuencia dentro de la instituci\u00f3n, la se\u00f1ora Abigail  va a usar este pr\u00e9stamo para compra de perfumes y joyas al por mayor y as\u00ed surtir su negocio, su raz\u00f3n para solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo es incrementar su mercader\u00eda, la se\u00f1ora Abigail enfrenta retos en su negocio que son la competencia y va a utilizar los beneficios en seguir comprando  mercader\u00eda y as\u00ed de esta manera genera m\u00e1s ingresos econ\u00f3micos, se siente feliz ya agradecida por la oportunidad que le brindan para crecer en su actividad, mejorar sus ingresos y por ende su calidad de vida.\t","en":"Se\u00f1ora Abigail is 23 years old.
