To help her to continue her operations, she has requested Kashf Foundation for a loan of PKR 40000 to buy reels of threads in different colors and packs of beads, sequins and stones for its embellishment. In this way she will be able to cater to more customers consistently. She is hopeful to get an increase in her income by targeting more customers. Kumman dreams for her children a bright future.

It is also the Community Development Block Headquarters, which is in one of the poorest region of the state. In this village, there is the separate hamlet of Mahar community. The main source of livelihood of this community is the weaving of bamboo baskets. In December 2013, after the intervention of Mahashakti Foundation, 13 poor women came out and formed a Self Help group named Maa Bastaren to take a loan for the development of their traditional businesses to lead a better life. Kalindi is one of the members of this group. She is 39 and resides with her husband, two sons and two daughters. She is sitting with her hand raised wearing a white sari in the photo. She is an active and straightforward woman. All members of this group belong to a very poor backdrop that is far away from all basic needs like education, shelter, health facilities etc.  \r\n\r\nKalindi's business (weaving bamboo baskets) is the traditional business of their community. Kalindi and her husband together do the processing work and weave baskets of different shape and size. They sell their products in the nearest weekly market of the town. Some traders also regularly come to this village to purchase bamboo products. Kalindi earns a monthly profit of Rs 3,000 from her business.

As proof of her commitment to this type of work and her interest to get ahead, she began baking bread using a small oven and two baking tins that were given to her by her partner.  Yeri decided to complete a technical course in baking and pastry making, and she has gotten better little by little.  She currently has two ovens and six baking tins.

Fabiola's passion and love for her work and her family drive her to look for new ways to get ahead and so she is applying for a loan in order to buy supplies (such as threads, material, zips and buttons). This will allow her to finish products that she has already started and to deliver orders on time and well done. She can then earn a higher income and receive more orders as her customers become loyal.\r\n\r\nFabiola tells us that her biggest desire is to increase her capacity by buying more machines and creating jobs.

Asmani has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and he is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 71 other individual farmers represented by this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. \r\n\r\nAsmani is 63 years old and has been a farmer for 40 years. Asmani works as a farmer to provide for his five children. The community and other farmers know Asmani as friendly, hardworking, reliable and trustworthy. Besides farming, he is also involved in his community in groups such as the savings group and prayer group. Asmani described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group. \r\n\r\nAsmani joined One Acre Fund in 2009, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Asmani joined One Acre Fund so that he can get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family. Because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Asmani has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Asmani's life because he has more profits from his harvest and was able to feed the family. In the future, Asmani hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and invest in a business. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Asmani and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer packages from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. \r\n\r\nJoseph is 45 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years to provide for his 10 children. The community and other farmers know Joseph as hardworking and trustworthy. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community in groups such as the men's group and savings group. Joseph hopes he can have an even better harvest this year with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in the group. \r\n\r\nJoseph first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Joseph joined One Acre Fund to get the best seed prices and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers. Joseph plans to use the money he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair his home, buy a cow and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nJoseph and the Lukhuna Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.

","en":"Jyparkul is 54 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising two children. Jyparkul and her husband are very responsible and hardworking people who are deeply respected by their fellow villagers. Jyparkul has a secondary education. She is a homemaker. As the main source of income for her family, Jyparkul practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 16 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 17,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Jyparkul's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 2 calves, 1 horse and 15 sheep on her farm, as well as a 3.6 hectare plot of land on which the family mainly grows beans for sale. Her monthly income is 9,000 som (KGS).

three dependent kids who really need her support, as one is too young for schooling while the remaining two are in school. The main sources of her family income are from a silk weaving business and a fishing business. \r\n\r\nLaiheng has never been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) before, and neither have her other five fellow members. All of them including Laiheng are seeking 1,000,000 KHR each. As the leader, she will spend her entire loan portion to buy raw silk and to pay for the labor costs that help to dye the color of her silk. \r\n\r\nLaiheng hopes that she can gain a good income from

She is hardworking and active. She started her work life as an employee in various sewing companies where she learned everything about running this type of business by observing. When presented with the opportunity to become independent, she and her husband made the decision to start their own third-party dressmaking shop. She works Monday through Saturday from 7:00 AM until 6:00 PM depending on the volume of work that she has pending. Thus she has been able to make enough income to cover her living expenses. With the help of this loan, she could come up with the money to buy a digital buttonhole machine. This will optimize production time and increase efficiency so she can make a timely delivery of orders, build loyalty with existing customers and attract new suppliers. Adriana says that her greatest wish is to expand her business to make it more profitable and afford her with the possibility of buying her own home. Thus she can enjoy a more comfortable and improved quality of life with her family. She also hopes to afford her son with the opportunity to study at a university so that he can become an honest and successful professional.

years old, married and has 5 children together with her husband. Kulsunkan has secondary education. She is quiet and responsible by nature. As a main source of income for her family, Kulsunkan works with livestock breeding, after having started 22 years ago with the purchase of 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Kulsunkan's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow and a calf.

Dariyka has higher education. She started her career as a high school teacher for the youngest classes. Then she got married, but she continued working. Dariyka is very responsible, sociable and cheerful by nature. \r\n\r\nTogether with her husband, Dariyka works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 21 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Dariyka's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows and 70 sheep. The monthly income from selling the milk is 10,000 som (KGS). Dariyka also processes 4.0 hectares of land, where she mainly grows beans and perennial grasses. She sells the harvest they get wholesale.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Dariyka turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan to purchase cows to increase the number of livestock. Dariyka plans to invest the income from the loan in increasing the number of livestock. She also plans to save money for expanding the cattle

She is a resident of the small region of Qubadiyon. She is 46 years old and married. Together with her husband she raises three children. The children go to school. Ikbol pays great attention to raising and educating her children. She did not receive higher education and would like for her children to be educated. \r\n\r\nIn order to help her husband feed the family, Ikbol works with livestock breeding. The larger part of the Tajik population work with agriculture. Ikbol is not an exception, as the nature and climate of her region is suitable to healthy breeding of cattle. Ikbol breeds cattle in her cow shed (you can see the shed behind Ikbol). Currently she has very few cows and she decided to apply for a loan in order to increase the number of cattle. She hopes you will help her so that she can purchase a calf and preserve her

She is married, and her husband is an agronomist. They have three daughters, who are studying at the university. Rosa lives with only her husband, and her daughters therefore only depend on her.\r\n\r\nRosa has been working in her business of selling new American clothing in the market for two years. In the past, she sold products from catalogs. She learned the business of selling clothing from her cousin, since she lent her the market location, and this was how she decided to work in this business. Rosa goes to the market on foot, and it takes 15 minutes from her house. She sells from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm.

Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 58 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here, but they will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. \r\n\r\nSamwel is 61 years old and has been a farmer for 35 years.  Samwel works as a farmer to provide for his 10 children. \r\n\r\nThe community and other farmers know Samwel as friendly, hardworking, reliable, and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group.  Samwel described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.  \r\n\r\nSamwel joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and he is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Samwel joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. Because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers.  So Samwel has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  \r\n\r\nWorking with One Acre Fund has improved Samwel's life because he has more profits from the harvest, has more farm training, was able to save money and feed his family. In the future, Samwel hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, save for the future, and buy a cow. \r\n\r\nSamwel and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. \r\n\r\nThroughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.

She is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo. The group leaders represent a total of 56 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Margaret has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. <br \/><br \/>Margaret is married and has two children.  She is 45 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable and trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and savings group.  Margaret has been a farmer for 22 years.  She described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. <br \/><br \/>Margaret first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Margaret joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and send her children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers.  Margaret plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and save for the future.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training, is able to save money and feed the family. <br \/><br \/>Margaret and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1490108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-03T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-02T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":299544,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3475,"local_amount":299544,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":300592.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723080}],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T12:42:04Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":677451,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn operates a general store to make a living.

Marygorety has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 69 other individual farmers represented by this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings. \r\n\r\nMarygorety is married and has eight children. She is 60 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, and trustworthy. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group and the prayer group. Marygorety has been a farmer for 32 years. She describes her harvest as good last year but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nMarygorety first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season. Marygorety joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers. Marygorety plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, save for the future, and buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Marygorety\u2019s own life has improved, because she has more farm training and was able to save money and feed her family. \r\n\r\nMarygorety and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers with profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.

He is pictured here with some One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent 64 One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured.  \r\n\r\nDaniel has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative, and he has his hand raised in the photo.  He and the other farmers each receive \u00bc acre of maize, \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet, and an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation. \r\n\r\nDaniel is married and has six children.  He is 61 years old, and he is friendly, trustworthy, and active in his community. Daniel has been a farmer for 35 years.  He described his harvest as poor last year, buthe believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with the One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nDaniel first enrolled in the One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Daniel joined One Acre Fund to learn new farming methods.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to spread the word about the One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nDaniel plans to use the money he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and to invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has many benefits.  Daniel\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training. \r\n\r\nDaniel and his Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of buying the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the savings on to the farmers. \r\n\r\nThroughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they repay the One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.

He is single and he is currently studying for a degree as an auto mechanic. He decided to study this field because he was interested in it, he thinks it will bring him higher earnings, and his present job is in the same field as his degree. Right now he is completing his 5th semester. A half year remains for him to complete his technical degree and he is very proud of this. His goal for when he completes his studies is to start an auto repair and renovation business for all types of motor vehicles and motorcycles. He is using the loan to purchase a laptop that will help him to complete his homework that he is assigned from his study center. Ramiro is very happy and very satisfied that he has received this loan because now he will be able to complete his homework in his room without having to go to an internet booth. His biggest dream in life is to complete his degree and to then to study for a degree in automotive engineering from a university. One of the biggest obstacles that he has faced up to this point has been an inability to maintain economic solvency because this degree requires a lot of expenses and items to purchase so that students can develop dynamically during their pre-professional training. Ramiro is very content and happy knowing that people from around the world are financing this loan. He is also very thankful for this great opportunity and the support that he is receiving because this will facilitate the completion of his studies for this professional degree.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1537868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Jetina has been selected as the Kiva representative.  Jetina has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 100 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nJetina is 63 years old and has been a farmer for 23 years. Jetina works as a farmer to provide for her 9 children. The community and other farmers know Jetina as hardworking, reliable and trustworthy. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community, participating in groups such as the women's group and savings group. Jetina is also involved in the community as the chairperson for a merry-go-round.  Jetina described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better harvest with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nJetina joined One Acre Fund in 2010 and will continue working with One Acre Fund in order to learn new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds. As an active member in her community, Jetina also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member and wants to help more farmers.  Jetina plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school and to save for the future. Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more farm training and is able to feed the family.\r\n\r\nJetina and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6200,"image":{"id":1543140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-03T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-02T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":6200,"lender_count":153,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jetina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sopha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oliver","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":534900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":6200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":534900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":6200,"local_amount":534900,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":536308.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723082}],"funded_date":"2014-03-14T15:47:02Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Kuperberg","image":null}},{"id":677470,"name":"Muslima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muslima was born in 1970.

She is enterprising, hardworking, and with a great desire to get ahead in life. She works in housekeeping activities from an early hour every day because she has 5 children, though only three live with her. The two oldest have their own families and live apart. The third child is in middle school and the last 2 are in primary school. She learned to work in the field from the time she was very young because she like the process and procedures for cultivating coffee. She understood it wasn\u2019t just a matter of digging a hole and planting a seed, but also taking care of it, fertilizing it, weeding, etc. that is needed to have a good plant and, at the end of each harvest, an excellent coffee bean. She learned all of this from her parents. She also learned to make nacatamales [a corn tamal wrapped in a banana leaf] and her customers are people from the neighborhood who buy on weekends. Along with her husband, they work together each day to be able to achieve their dream, which is to see their children educated, in university, with a better lifestyle, and at the same time to provide them with a good future and a place to build their houses. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan to buy agricultural products such as fertilizer, foliar fertilizers, insecticides, etc. so that she can apply them in order to take care of the coffee plants. She also has a small piece of land with corn and beans, which generates more income for the wellbeing of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":768.75,"image":{"id":1537883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs for taking care of her coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-03-03T04:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-02T04:00:08Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":768.75,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":15067.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762647}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T12:23:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}}]}
