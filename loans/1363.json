Karamatkan has a secondary level education and her family's main source of income is the animal husbandry business she started 13 years ago with a purchase of 20,000 som (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today Karamatkan has 10 milk cows, two bulls, six bull-calves, three calves, and one horse.  Her monthly income amounts to 20,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Karamatkan applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd and for earning additional income from selling their milk.

mother of four children.  She lives with her family and her daughter in law.  They have a very close-knit family.  As a young woman, Bisaida was not able to go to school and earn an education because her family had many troubles with money.  But her mother taught her to bake delicious traditional flat breads.  She has been in this line of work for all her life.  She works in a private bakery that specializes in traditional flat breads and earns a good income.  She helps the men in her family with the house and with the family budget.  She really enjoys her work.  Bisaida's daughter also helps her bake.  \r\n\r\nBisaida will soon be marrying off her last son and she has saved up a little money.  Since a wedding is an important affair, every Tajik family starts to get ready several years in advance.  Nonetheless, Bisaida still needed to apply to MDO Arvand for a loan for financial support.  She was referred to MDO Arvand by acquaintances and she is requesting the loan to prepare for the wedding.  Bisaida is planning to buy her son's bride token.  She hopes that MDO Arvand will help her with this financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1545096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

She and her family live in J. Rumy.  Sanovbar wants to open her own business - she intends to take out a loan and to start raising sheep.  A large portion of the population of Tajikistan has, since ancient times, engaged in agricultural activities.  Because 93% of the state is covered in mountains, and because businesses are located only on the plains, animal husbandry and farming continue to be popular in Tajikistan.  To this day, agriculture remains the major source of income for people living in the mountains.  Sanovbar, using the climate of her native land, wants to start and to continue to engage in such pursuits.  The climate and nature of Tajikistan promote the healthy growth of plants and animals.  Sanovbar hopes that, with help, she can begin these activities, and that she can help her husband provide for their family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1534.17,"image":{"id":1544859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

","en":"Shahodat, at 66 years old, is an elderly resident of Spitamen.  She worked for many years as a middle school teacher.  In her village she is respected by all for her wisdom and prudence.  She always provides anyone who turns to her for assistance with her sage advice.  Now, in her later years, Shahodat has decided to provide for herself by working.  She is interested in raising and selling cattle.  She will not have trouble with feed because her family rents a plot of land, on which they grow grain and corn.  Shahodat already has a barn and feed for cattle (hay, straw, and corn), which will serve as starting capital.  She is asking for a loan of 2000 American dollars in order to purchase three head of cattle of a good breed.  Shahodat believes that her age will not interfere, and that she will be given a chance to prove herself in this new venture."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475.77,"image":{"id":1544866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

She will sell the merchandise for cash and credit in Sabalibougou and as an itinerant saleswoman to her mainly female clientele. With this loan Mme Sika hopes to make an average monthly profit of 100 000 FCFA which she will use to reinvest in her business and to provide for her children's care."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1543260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy wax pagnes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-03-03T10:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-02T10:20:01Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sika                           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045874},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263725},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960604},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504676965},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676659},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209102}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T15:08:16Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:27:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":675824,"name":"Carmen Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Carmen es originaria de Camoapa, Casada y madre de un hijo.

Estela's dream is to expand her business and increase her loyal client base. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1537939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients (vegetables, grains, meats), a stove and a gas bottle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-03-03T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-02T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49993},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51374},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52793},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54251},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55750},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57290},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58873},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60499},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62170},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63888},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65652},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67467}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.39,"local_amount":106772,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":109093.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227889},{"amount":296.61,"local_amount":593228,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T10:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":606126.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245509}],"funded_date":"2014-03-09T23:33:14Z","paid_date":"2014-05-22T10:01:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Alcaina","image":1232159}},{"id":678507,"name":"Saparbu","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443 51 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u0423 \u0421\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443 -

","en":"Saparbu is 51, married, and has three children. All of her kids live away from home with their own families. Saparbu has a high school education and is optimistic and hardworking. Her spouse lives and works in Russia and sends part of his earnings home to Kyrgyzstan. Saparbu earns her family's main income through animal husbandry, which she first got involved in 33 years ago when she purchased livestock for 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Saparbu currently has eight dairy cows and 15 sheep. She has everything necessary to care for the animals, including pasture land and feed. She keeps the animals at the farm during the winter and turns them out to pasture with a shepherd from spring to fall. She earns 15,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to continue developing her farm, Saparbu applied for a loan with the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan to buy calves to increase her livestock headcount. She plans to use the profits to invest in additional livestock and to save enough money to build a new house.

She had her first child when she was finishing school, and therefore she could not continue studying. She needed to work in order to provide for her child, since she did not have any other options. As she did not have her degree at the time, she had to take a job in a factory. Though very grateful for the opportunity, this is not what she wanted to do with her life. She never abandoned the idea of finishing her studies and always knew she did not want to let her circumstances dictate her future. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 22, Yarledis had her second child and her economic situation once again deteriorated, especially since she could not find gainful employment while she was pregnant. After the birth of the child, she was able to once again find a job but her expenses were much higher than they were previously since she now had two children to take care of.

Her family's main income comes from livestock, a business she started nine years ago by buying cattle for 10,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nThrough hard work, her business now consists of two dairy cows and 16 goats, as well as a fruit orchard where she grows apples and plums. She sells the fruit to wholesalers. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. Akylay has applied for a loan from Bai-Tushum micro-finance bank to buy breeding calves to expand her business. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the extra income to invest in expanding her herd and buying the supplies to build a new holding space for the cattle.

Jyldyz has a secondary education.  To provide the primary income for her family, Jyldyz is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 21 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 5 sheep and 1 horse.  She has all of the necessary conditions for keeping livestock.  The feed and hay have been prepared.

To provide the primary income for her family, Nigora is involved in animal husbandry, with her brother and parents helping her.  She started 4 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow and 3 sheep.  The monthly income amounts to 7,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Nigora requested a loan from the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Nigora plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a new space for her

However, she needs to irrigate the land. Her income from farming is about 150,000 KGS annually. Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS. Ainagul has applied for a loan from micro-finance bank, Bai-Tushum, to buy seeds (apricot, tomato, pepper and cotton) to plant.

Adriana is employed by a nearby corner store, and Eduardo works in the field. They recently made an addition to their house of two bedrooms so the girls and the boy could have their own rooms.

Adriana and Eduardo could not afford to finish the construction. They have been saving for the last few months to finish what they started. Adriana is asking for a loan to finish buying the materials so they can have the two bedrooms completed.

She has seen first hand the opportunity that it provides farmers, as well as the discrimination that women farmers often face. \n\nIn 2013, Joy and her two friends, Peninah and Therese, started Women In Coffee Initiative, a women-owned coffee washing station that buys raw inputs from women farmers in Rwanda. Over the past year, Women In Coffee Initiative has worked hard to buy the necessary land and build the necessary drying tables to start their business.  With their internal capacity ready, Women In Coffee Initiative needs to buy a coffee washing machine, the last piece needed to officially begin their business.\n\nWomen In Coffee Initiative will not only support women coffee farmers, but they will also employ women employees.  During the washing and drying season (April - August), Women In Coffee Initiative estimates employing 75-100 workers to sort, dry, and package the washed coffee cherries.\n\nThis business has the potential to be a tremendous success.  With an experienced leader, a dedicated team, and a strategic location, Women In Coffee Initiative aims to become a strong player in both domestic and international markets. But, like many new businesses, Women In Coffee Initiative cannot access commercial bank loans because they haven't been in business long enough and their loan request is too small.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Women In Coffee Initiative can start their business and prove to Rwanda the strength of women in coffee. \n\nAbout the owners:\nJoy is married with 7 children (5 boys and 2 girls) and other (8) extended family members. Joy is educated and holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Project Management and has been working in the coffee sector since 2003.\n\nPeninah is a single mother with 3 children (1 girl and 2 boys). Peninah did not get the opportunity finish high school because her family could not afford to pay her school fees.\n\nTherese is widow and a mother of 2 children (1 boy and 1 girl). She dropped out of primary school because her parents were very poor.\n\nJoy, Peninah, and Therese have been friends for

He is 38-years-old and he has four children, three of them are in school. \n\nHe started a fishing business in 1990 with the hope of generating enough income which he will use to educate his children.

Maritza  herself studied until fifth grade at primary school and she is grateful for the effort and financial support her parents gave her.  She has had over 10 years experience working the land and she has a great deal of knowledge in many areas of farming as her parents taught her how to work the land at a very young age. The land that she and her husband care for is one kilometer away from the town where they live so they have to travel by bus to get to their coffee crops. \r\n\r\nMaritza has asked the COMIXMUL cooperative for a loan to buy manure and fertiliser, amongst other things, to care for and maintain her crops.\r\n\r\nIn the future Maritza plans to buy more land to grow coffee so that she can create a better legacy for her children to have a better income and living conditions.

Lorena has a primary school education, and she is very grateful for the moral and financial support of her parents given the many difficulties she has had this year.  The income she has generated has not been sufficient to cover all of her home expenses or the expenses for her to continue her education. Lorena and her husband both work cultivating coffee crops, from which they generate the income needed to support their family. The land that they work was inherited from Lorena's father, and as a result of this gift they have been able to work and generate their own income. Their clients are different intermediaries that come to or live in their area, as well as bodegas and other buyers. \r\n\r\nLorena's goal is to be able to support her children until they finish their studies and become independent professionals, with better opportunities then field work which is very demanding.

Robert has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative, and he is on the right of the photo, with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 55 other individual farmers represented by this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant a \u00bc acre of maize and a \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here, but they will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan Shillings. \r\n\r\nRobert is a reliable member of the community, and joined One Acre Fund because he needed better harvests. He is 38 years old and married with seven children. He has been working as a farmer for the last 12 years to support his family. In addition to this, Robert is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group and savings group. He described his harvest last year as being good. He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoying the success he is having with its farm packages. \r\n\r\nRobert joined One Acre Fund in 2012 to get the best seed prices and new farming methods, and he is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. He is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, so he has gotten more involved as a group leader and as a Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Robert's life because he has more farm training and he was able to save money and feed his family. In the future, Robert hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nRobert and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make repayments.

He is pictured here in a group of nine One Acre Fund lead farmers. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left. These group leaders represent a total of 83 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. John has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving a \u00bc acre of maize and a \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan Shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. \r\n\r\nJohn is married and has nine children. He is 57 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee. John has been a farmer for 30 years. John described his harvest as excellent last year but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. John first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. John joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, try new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and to send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. John plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for its farmers. John\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from his harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, and he has been able to feed his family. \r\n\r\nJohn and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers with the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make repayments. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to access hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.

He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages. \r\n\r\nCharles joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family.  Charles also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers.  Charles is also involved in the community's peace coordination.  Charles plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school and invest in a business.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from the harvest, was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nCharles and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

On average, they are 43 years old, and have five children each.  They all live in the Kalaban Coro neighborhood of the district of Bamako.  They are friends, relatives or neighbors, and also know one another through their income-generating activities at the Kalaban Coro market.  They are involved in small retail and sell condiments (onions, shallots...), wax-print \"pagnes\" (colorful West-African fabrics), incense and charcoal.  In order to have enough cash to buy fresh supplies of goods, the members of the group have decided to join Soro Yiriwaso.  This is their third solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nMariam, the featured borrower, is a well-known onion seller.  In the photo, she is seated in the middle of the front row.  She is planning to use her loan to buy 1,000 kilos of onions, in bulk, at the market.  She resells her merchandise for cash or on credit in Sabalibougou, and she also works as an itinerant seller.  Most of her customers are women.  Thanks to this loan, she is expecting to make an average monthly profit of 90,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in her business and also used to take care of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1543381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy onions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-03-04T05:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-03T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokona      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aye    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045881},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263732},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960611},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504676972},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676666},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":208333.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":209662.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209117}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T16:13:50Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:29:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":676538,"name":"Norma Evelin Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Norma de 44 a\u00f1os de edad,   no logro estudiar mucho solo  logro estudiar hasta tercer grado en la escuela, actualmente la se\u00f1ora Norma esta acompa\u00f1ada  quien esta postrado en una cama debido a una fuerte enfermedad en sus piernas, la se\u00f1ora dentro de su hogar tiene tres hijos, dos de los cuales ya est\u00e1n casados y no viven con ella solo tiene a su hija menor quien esta estudiando su primer a\u00f1o de bachillerato .\n\n\nLa Se\u00f1ora Norma tiene un negocio de venta de tortillas desde hace 8 a\u00f1os, que fue cuando su pareja sufri\u00f3 la terrible enfermedad, entonces decidi\u00f3 poner la venta de tortillas.

Currently Se\u00f1ora Norma is with her spouse who is weak and in bed due to a strong illness in his legs.

She holds the tortilla sales in her house and every afternoon her youngest daughter assists her to either sell the tortillas or to drop off orders of tortillas at others' houses. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting to CREDICAMPO is to purchase an industrial griddle to improve her business, since she has been making her tortillas on a clay griddle. This will help her immensely because she will be able to sell more tortillas in less time and also will be able to pay for the treatment of her spouse so that he gets better. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Norma's dream is that her spouse is able to recuperate and therefore they can work together, her selling tortillas and him with his old job of metallic structures.

Philip has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is shown standing on the right in the photo with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving a \u00bc acre of maize and a \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. \r\n\r\nPhilip, who works to provide for his three children, is 40 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years. The community and other farmers know Philip as friendly, hardworking, reliable and trustworthy. He is also involved in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group and the prayer group. Philip described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group. \r\n\r\nPhilip first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. He joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds so as to earn enough to feed his family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Philip plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for its farmers.  Philip\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, and has been able to feed his family. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto farmers. Philip and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seed and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund provides ongoing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is shown standing on the left.

He is pictured here in a group of six One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo. The group leaders represent a total of 72 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Moses has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative, and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation. <br \/><br \/>Moses is 37 years old and has been a farmer for 18 years. He works as a farmer to provide for his five children. The community and other farmers know Moses as a hardworking and experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in the community in groups such as the men's group and the savings group. Moses described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group. <br \/><br \/>Moses first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012, and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Moses joined One Acre Fund to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and earn enough to feed the family. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers. Moses plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Moses\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and was able to save money and feed the family. <br \/><br \/>One Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Moses and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

He is a father of seven children between 19 and 7 years old and he hopes to use the profits from the business to give his children a better quality education. He has applied for a loan of 1,500,000 UGX to buy more goats to sell so he can make enough profits, grow his business and become financially stable. His clients are mainly goat traders in his area of operation and they support him so he never lacks a market for his goats. He is challenged by the stiff competition in the area he operates since there are many goat trades. However, he believes that it will not be a challenge any more if the loan is given since he will use the money to buy better looking goats and will have enough stock and be in a position to out compete his competitors. He is generally a hard working man and he hopes to work even harder so the loan money can be paid back with some profits remaining to use to meet the needs of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1545043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy goats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-03-04T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-03T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Porphirius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":150912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468059601},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":150912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479277434},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":150912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490974019},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":150912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504415061},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":150912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692646},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":150912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530922883},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":150912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542676279},{"amount":60,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":150912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561809902},{"amount":120,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":301824,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579786237}],"funded_date":"2014-03-05T22:00:20Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T15:47:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":677770,"name":"Penda's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe est constitu\u00e9 de femmes qui habitent le m\u00eame quartier; elles ont comme principale activit\u00e9 le commerce.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo. The group leaders represent a total of fifty-seven individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Wycliffe has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. \r\n\r\nWycliffe is a reliable member of the community. He is married with eight children. Wycliffe is fifty-four years old and has been working as a farmer for the last forty-five years to support his family. In addition to this, Wycliffe is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, savings group, prayer group and the burial committee. He described his harvest last year as good. He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and keep enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages. \r\n\r\nWycliffe first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers learn about One Acre Fund. Wycliffe plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Wycliffe\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training and more farm group support, which enabled him to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Wycliffe and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.

The fish business is his sole source of income. He hopes to use this loan of 1,500,000 UGX to buy fish nets so that he can catch better fish and in big quantities. This will improve his sales and hence the profits he earns from the business. \r\n\r\nSabiiti operates the business from Kagera- kazinga in Katunguru of the Rubiriszi district.

They live in the small village of Baroghoria in the district of Jalpaiguri, in their own house.\r\n\r\nLaili\u2019s husband grows seasonal vegetables in their ancestral land. He sells the resulting harvest in the local market. His income does not provide sufficient financial sustenance to the family. \r\n\r\nTo provide an additional source of income, Laili is involved in animal husbandry, having started 10 years ago with a purchase of one cow. Now she has decided to expand her business by purchasing one more cow. She has taken a loan from BJS to purchase a dairy cow and grow her milk supply business. She hopes it will generate additional profit with which she can cover the household expenses. She plans to invest the income for further increasing domestic livestock quantities to make a herd of cattle.\r\n\r\nShe is very much thankful to her lenders (Kiva and BJS).\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1537518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow to start a milk supply business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-03-04T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-03T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laili","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-04T15:49:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":676554,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy cement, iron, blocks, wood, wiring, and metal sheets.
