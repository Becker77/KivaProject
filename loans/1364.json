One of her children goes to school and the other is too small to go to school. Kunti is a housewife and her husband runs a poultry farm. The income generated by her husband is insufficient to cover all their household expenses.  Their children are deprived of basic needs due to their poverty.  Kunti assists her husband in the poultry farm.\r\n\r\nAt present, the poultry farm business is not in good condition, as they lack capital to expand the farm.  Kunti heard about Kiva's partner BJS and that the organization helps rural women, and she applied for a loan.\r\n\r\nWith the loan money she will buy more chicks, chicken feed and medicine for her poultry farm, so that she can earn more profit from this business.  She is much interested to expand this business because after the growth of their chicks, they can sell them to their neighbors and to meat shops in the local market and earn a profit easily. As her husband is more experienced in this field, it will help her to run the business smoothly.\r\n\r\nAt present, she is living in a kachha house (made of straw, bamboo and mud), but she hopes that she will be able to build a concrete house for her family, with the profit from their business.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva and BJS for funding the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1537615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase more chicks and chicken feed for their existing poultry farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-03-04T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-03T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kunti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-04T23:29:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":678070,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a  Kiva borrower.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund farmers, each of whom is a group leader. The group leaders represent a total of 52 individual One Acre Fund farmers, who are not pictured here. Wycliffe has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented by this group are each receiving inputs to grow \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. <br \/><br \/>Wycliffe is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 11 years. He works as a farmer to provide for his five children. The community and other farmers know Wycliffe as an experienced and hardworking farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in community groups such as the men's group and a savings group. Wycliffe described his harvest last year as good, but he hopes he can have an even better one this season, with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.<br \/><br \/>Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund in 2008, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. He joined One Acre Fund so that he could learn new farming methods. Because he is an active community member, he has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Wycliffe's life, because he received training and was able to feed the family. In the future, he hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to invest in a business. <br \/><br \/>One Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seed and fertilizer, when prices are low, and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Wycliffe and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover the initial cost of purchasing the seed and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season, to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives. <br \/><br \/>The field officer is also included in the

raising two children. Bubikan has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Bubikan practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 29 years ago with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bubikan's hard work, she currently has 3 milk cows and 5 sheep on her farm, as well as a 0.78 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, cabbages, melons and watermelons for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Bubikan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy fertilizer for tilling her land, as well as to pay hired workers to cultivate and till her land. Bubikan plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for her youngest son's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1547514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

Farida has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Farida practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 30 years ago with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Farida's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow on her farm, as well as a 1.82 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, cabbage, melons and watermelons for personal consumption and sale. She also has a hothouse on the territory surrounding her home. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Farida turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers to cultivate her land, as well as to pay hired workers to cultivate and till her land. Farida plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for her children's

He is pictured here in a group of six One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of seventy individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Eliud has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving seeds for one quarter acre of maize and one quarter acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of KES 5,349 for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation. \r\n\r\nEliud is 47 years old and has been a farmer for eleven years. Eliud works as a farmer to provide for his five children. The community and other farmers know Eliud as hardworking and trustworthy. Other than farming, he is also involved in groups in his community, such as the men's group, savings group, and burial committee. Eliud described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group. Eliud joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Eliud joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices and get new farming methods. Eliud has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Eliud's life because he has more profits from harvest and was able to feed the family. In the future, Eliud hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and save for the future. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Eliud and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.

","en":"Nazgul is 40 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising three sons. Nazgul has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Nazgul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 21 years ago with an initial purchase of livestock in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to the hard work of Nazgul and her sons, she currently has 2 milk cows, 2 calves, 20 sheep and 1 foal on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

Talantbek has a secondary education. As the main source of income for his family, Talantbek practices livestock breeding. He started this business 5 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Talantbek's hard work, he currently has 1 foal and 95 sheep on his farm. In the summertime, he brings his livestock out to pasture and hires a shepherd to watch them. In the winter time, he keeps his livestock at home. His monthly income is 18,000 som (KGS).

He is pictured here with a group of eight One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 89 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Moses has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation. \r\n\r\nMoses is 49 years old, married, and has nine children. He is known as a friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Moses has been a farmer for 16 years. He described his harvest as poor last year, but believes he can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. Moses first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. He joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund. Moses plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. \r\n\r\nMoses notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Moses\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from the harvests, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family. Moses and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.

She has been a group member for 3 years now and from the group loans she has achieved a lot. She learned about biogas a year ago when VEP officials trained the group members and she decided to take up the project after completing a loan she was repaying.\r\n\r\nShe has seen a biogas stove from her neighbour and now fully understands the benefits. She has taken a new loan to have a biogas stove constructed for her and by mid March she will be using it instead of charcoal and firewood. With a lifespan of about 30 to 50 years, Veronica and her children may not need to use any other fuel hence saving on money and time spent collecting wood. The family will also enjoy a smoke-free kitchen and soot-free cooking pots, and this will result in good health that is free from respiratory diseases.\r\n\r\nBeing a farmer, Veronica will also use the slurry to grow food crops and as fodder for the livestock. This will increase the harvest, ensuring food security and some income from the surplus.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":979.25,"image":{"id":1545401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

circle of support with each other. In each weekly meeting, they emphasize the confidence, accountability and adherence to training that they have been receiving from ID-Ghana. Their goal is to continue together for many more loan cycles and maintain an excellent credit record. In addition, they are gaining a lot of useful knowledge each week with the ID-Ghana Loan Officer who presents various educational training sessions on relevant and useful themes like financial management, nutrition and health. It is the combination of the loans and education that makes the Micro credit Program of ID-Ghana so useful to Christo Nti group members. \r\n\r\nGodwin has been selling jeans and shirt for 3 years. He is 56 years old, married and has children. He stays in his own house with his wife and children in Teshie. He needs this loan to buy jeans and shirts to sell to his customers. The other members of his group are Elizabeth, who sells dried pepper and dried fish, Abraham, who sells African design bags, and Cecilia, who sells wigs and creams. They will need a total amount of 2300 GHS to better their businesses. Each one is responsible for one another's repayment of the loan (group pressure). They want to share that they are very grateful to Kiva investors for believing in them and funding their loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1545438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy jeans and shirts to sell to his customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Teshie, Accra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":231,"posted_date":"2014-03-04T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-03T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":70.79,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":252.05,"local_amount":626.71,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T13:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":643.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467937058},{"amount":173.17,"local_amount":438.56,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":450.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.21,"payment_id":479157881},{"amount":243.4,"local_amount":665.93,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":684.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.42,"payment_id":490852081},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":519.95,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":534.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.27,"payment_id":504278735},{"amount":14.75,"local_amount":48.85,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.89,"payment_id":517561290}],"funded_date":"2014-03-05T14:49:14Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T12:45:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neil Garvin","image":835015}},{"id":678143,"name":"Mary Njeri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is married and has seven children; some are in school and others have completed.

He is concerned about providing his family with well-being and their daily needs.\r\n\r\nDue to a lack of work experience, it has been difficult for him to find stable job opportunities, despite having studied three types of technology with the help of his family. This motivated him to start his own business, a grocery store in which he has also installed a space to rent video games. He works alone every day from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. He learned about this business empirically and has managed to generate the necessary income to survive along with his family.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of improving his income, Carlos would like to expand his business with an internet cafe. He is applying for a loan to buy four computers and to set up the cafe so that he can start this new business activity. The idea came to him because of the need for this business in the community where he lives. There is no other business in the area which offers this service, which will be his main advantage.\r\n\r\nWith his dynamic personality and motivation to accomplish his goals, Carlos would like to consolidate his business so that it will generate a profit. In the future, he would like to open another business, a minimarket, so that he can serve different markets and guarantee financial stability for his family, offering them well-being and a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1540208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy four computers and set up an internet cafe.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-03-04T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-03T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.35,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":264531},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271846},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279364},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287090},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295029},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303188},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311573},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320190},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329044},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":338145}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.63,"local_amount":253483,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":254552.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227897},{"amount":133.58,"local_amount":271683,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T10:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":272829.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245518},{"amount":137.35,"local_amount":279363,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":280542.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856253},{"amount":287.19,"local_amount":584113,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":586578.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282947},{"amount":148.97,"local_amount":302982,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":304260.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983327},{"amount":152.46,"local_amount":310078,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":311386.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542541533},{"amount":157.27,"local_amount":319863,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":321213.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561674515},{"amount":150.9,"local_amount":328533,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":329919.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.63,"payment_id":579598253},{"amount":159.3,"local_amount":349902,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":351378.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.72,"payment_id":595188315}],"funded_date":"2014-03-09T23:37:09Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:27:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":678351,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene is 42-years-old and has six children.

and educated by his father, who taught him about farm labor from a young age. Thanks to this, he is now working as a brush cutter, offering his services to the farm owners in his region. This allows him to generate the financial income to support his household and cover his personal expenses.\r\n\r\nCamilo recently bought a brush cutter on credit, which he is still paying off in installments. This detracts from the income he earns for his services, because the interest rate is quite high. Therefore, he has requested a loan to pay off his remaining credit on the brush cutter. He will use the rest of the loan to maintain the machine. This will help him to improve the quality of his service, as well as improving its utility, which will bring in a greater income for his family.\r\n\r\nCamilo's dreams are to continue moving forward and to buy another brush cutter which he can rent out to earn additional income.

Sanchita had secondary education but her husband completed higher secondary education.  One of their daughters goes to college and the other two are in grade 10 and grade 5. The family live in their own house.\r\n\r\nSanchita's husband is very hardworking and dedicated.  He invests his full time in his agricultural business and grows different vegetables.  Sanchita also helps him in his work, after managing her household jobs.  They sell their produces in the local market. But their income from this business is hardly enough to cover the family's basic needs.  So in order to improve their business and earn more income, she would like to expand their business. They have decided to cultivate potatoes in their farmland. Potatoes are a vegetable in much demand in their area, as they are used in most dishes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sanchita has taken a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS, to purchase potato seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation of potatoes.  The loan is important for Sanchita to bring in a high enough income to sustain her family and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nSanchita hopes to give higher education to her daughters and purchase a plot of land in future with the profit generated from this business.\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to BJS and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1543072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase potato seeds and fertilizers for cultivating potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-03-04T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-03T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanchita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-05T02:27:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":678422,"name":"Leutuva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leutuva is a 20-year-old, single woman, with one child.

Therefore, Hashmat has applied for Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Therefore Shakeela has applied for a Kiva loan from BRAC Pakistan to help her husband in his business.  This loan will enable her husband to buy these medicines as per his business needs and this will also enable him to earn a profitable income from his business.

The benefit of Kiva would be of great assistance, since the amount of the monthly payments would be more economical and the expenses could be smaller."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1541562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of school fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-05T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-04T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kennedy Lenis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":153374.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882855},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":153374.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202220},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":153374.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286361},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":153374.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225068}],"funded_date":"2014-03-05T03:24:17Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":678521,"name":"Clarissa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clarissa is the sole provider for her family.

He will also pay for the right to connect to the electrical grid. This will help him a lot, since his children who are in school have homework at night. Now they have candlelight, but the loan will help them so that they can do their homework and do well in their studies.

He opens his business from 8 AM to midnight daily and is able to make a fair monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis is Epimack's sixth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used the previous loans, all of which he paid back successfully, to buy sacks of charcoal for his genge business. With the profit received, Epimack covered home food expenses and school fees for his kids. He will use this loan to rebuild his genge place with iron and steel materials. He needs to make his place strong against thieves who broke into his place and stole business items.

She has been knitting embroidery by hand at home for many years to support her family. Her husband has grown old and stays idle at home. One of her sons is doing work in a firm but earns an insufficient income to support his family. So, he brings some embroidery work home for his mother. Shabana helps her son complete daily tasks related to embroidery. She sells knitted embroidery in her hometown. By this time, she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nShe is a mother of six children and is motivated to provide for her family. To cope with the increasing demand of her customers, she has requested a loan for purchasing raw materials so she can knit and directly sell embroideries into the market to generate a healthy income for her family. She hopes to get a boost in her earnings through her large sales. She wishes to utilize a portion of revenue to provide a quality education for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1546640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy sequins, pearls, threads and a wooden frame for embroidery.

is a 38-year-old married woman. She is a hardworking and brave mother who is helping her family by providing tailoring services in her community. As a mother, she wants to provide better facilities for her children, so this is the reason she is doing extraordinary hard work to keep her children smiling.\r\n\r\nShe has been sewing clothes since the birth of her two children. When she observed that her husband failed to provide all the necessities for her children, she decided to start tailoring work at home, and up until now she has been sewing clothes in her community. She wants to enhance the beauty of her stitching, so she wants to buy a juki machine (a professional sewing machine). Professional people use this machine for tailoring because its speed is very good.\r\n\r\nRubina knows the techniques of tailoring very well. Her regular customers are mostly her neighbors, relatives and the local community people. She requested a loan to buy a new sewing machine and some packs of zippers and buttons to meet increasing demands. She is very thankful to Kiva and Field Partner, BRAC

He needs to purchase accessories for the barber shop, such as blades, furniture, mirror, combs, etc., but due to insufficient financial means, he is unable to purchase these accessories. Therefore, Rukhsana is applying for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can assist her husband to purchase these barber-shop accessories in bulk for his business. He can also increase the size of his business and earn maximum profit with the help of this loan amount.\r\n\r\nRukhsana is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1546775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

He only attended school until the ninth grade.  He was not able to continue high school because the school was 40km from his house and in those days, he did not have transportation.  He is now married, and his wife is a homemaker.  They have three children, but only one of their daughters and two grandchildren live with them.  \r\n\r\nApolinario has devoted himself to agriculture from a young age.  He plants corn, beans and sorghum.  He learned this activity from his father and grandfather, who taught him good principles and values that have made him into a well-known and respected person in the community.  He has 49 years of experience in agriculture, which has now become his main source of income.  He sells about 50% of his harvest, and the rest he uses for his family.  His workplace is about 5km from his house.  One of his sons helps him with the work, and they work from 7am to 1pm.  \r\n\r\nHe really needs the loan that he is seeking to prepare the irrigation system for his crops, pay to transport his harvest from the field to his house, and pay for the rental of a machine to shuck the corn.  Through this, he will facilitate the preparation and storage of the basic grains, because if it were not for the help of these agricultural machines, the process would take about a month.\r\n\r\nApolinario has many aims for the future.  He wishes to expand and diversify his crops, support his children and grandchildren in everything that they need to prepare and develop academically, as one of his grandchildren wants to become a veterinarian.  He hopes to achieve all of this by investing his earnings well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1541463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Three of the children are in college and two are in secondary school. Nazgul has a high school education and is hardworking, driven, enterprising, and forward-looking by nature. Her main care in life is for her children. She earns her family's main income through animal husbandry, which she first got involved in five years ago when she purchased  cattle for 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, she now has two dairy cows, three horses, and a 7.77 hectare plot of land where she plants potatoes and wheat. Her harvests are always rich and she earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to continue developing her farm, Nazgul asked the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan to purchase steers for fattening and resale. She plans to use the profits to invest in additional livestock and to save money for land in order to build a house for her eldest son.
