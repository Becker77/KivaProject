The economy is based on agriculture as well as the production and sale of handicrafts. \r\nOn the southwest part of the Lake, the newly formed Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cFlor del Lago Atitlan\u201d is ready to empower themselves and leave poverty behind. It is composed of seven young women who are eager to develop themselves and their businesses. They have requested a loan with Friendship Bridge, attracted not only by the microloans, but also by the educational trainings on subjects like effective business practices, indebtedness, health and nutrition as well as self esteem and women\u2019s rights.\r\nEva is a 19 year old unmarried member of the Trust Bank. She just graduated from high school with a degree in the medical field. As Eva was unable to find a job, she decided to continue with the business that her mother started two years ago which involves the sale of cosmetics. As more clients are patronizing the business, Eva decided to request a loan from Friendship Bridge. She will use the funds to purchase additional cosmetics and increase her inventory. Eva is committed to increasing the living standard of her family and is working hard to accomplish this goal.\r\nThe \u2018Flor del Lago Atitlan\u201d Trust Bank has elected Eva to be the Secretary because she has many useful skills and talents. She is enjoying this role and is appreciative that she can serve the group. On behalf of the ladies in the Trust Bank, Eva expresses gratitude to all KIVA investors for believing in the goals and dreams of herself and the other members of the Trust Bank. All of the women are committed to repaying the funds for this loan cycle and look forward to future loans.They have a clear vision of a successful and more prosperous future for themselves and their families!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1546981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional cosmetics for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santiago Atitl\u00e1n, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2014-03-05T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-04T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefa Tzina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Antonieta Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Alma Izabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":18400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2302.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2302.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2302.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2302.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2302.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2302.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2302.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2281.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300.34,"local_amount":2302.6,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T12:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467915963},{"amount":300.34,"local_amount":2302.6,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479136772},{"amount":300.34,"local_amount":2302.6,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490830662},{"amount":300.34,"local_amount":2302.6,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256605},{"amount":300.34,"local_amount":2302.6,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540128},{"amount":300.34,"local_amount":2302.6,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530023374},{"amount":300.34,"local_amount":2302.6,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542515475},{"amount":297.62,"local_amount":2281.8,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2305.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649013}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T03:08:38Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T12:08:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":678768,"name":"Bella Vista Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bella vista\r\n\r\nIn San Pedro La Laguna, Guatemala a place well known for its arts and the natural dye technique that its women use for their textiles, a trust bank called Bella Vista, formed a few years ago.

Others have small stores with items for daily consumption. \r\n\r\nLisbeth is a 21 year old member of the Trust Bank with two children, ages five and eight. She is married to a bricklayer. She started a hotdog business a few years back and currently the business is doing quite well. Lisbeth wants to inject more financial capital in the business and so she has requested a new loan which will be used for the purchase of supplies to produce more hotdogs. Since the school year began she wants to increase her business. Her future plans are to sell Mexican tortas or sandwiches.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank, \"Arca de Noe\", enjoy being together and offering eachother support. They look forward to their monthly meetings where they not only make payments on their loans, but also receive valuable and useful educational training from a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank officer on subjects like effective business practices, money management, children\u2019s health and nutrition, as well as women\u2019s rights and self esteem. Lisbeth and her fellow Trust Bank members face a brighter future as empowered women eliminating poverty because of their own efforts as well as their association with KIVA and Friendship Bridge.

","en":"Munara is 27 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising three children. Munara has an unfinished higher education. Her husband is a taxi driver. As the main source of income for her family, Munara practices livestock breeding. She started this business 8 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Munara's hard work, she currently has 5 milk cows, 7 horses and 1 calf on her farm. In addition, Munara bakes pastries and sells them to wholesale vendors for a set price.  Their monthly joint income is 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Munara turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy calves to increase the size of her herd. Munara plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to build a house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1548445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-03-05T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-04T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":92.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":962.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":962.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50469.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440486},{"amount":870.06,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":50469.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":92.44,"payment_id":636160990}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T18:05:00Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":678773,"name":"Jocel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocel is 29 years old and married with two children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

lives in Nyamagabe District, the poorest in Rwanda. Motivated by the poverty and malnutrition he saw in his community, Ange made a commitment at age 7 to devote his life and work to integrating poverty reduction, food security, and environmental protection in Nyamagabe.\n\nLast year, he created BIOCOOP RWANDA, a youth cooperative made up of 600 members to improve opportunities for people living in the district. Already, BIOCOOP has launched projects on youth entrepreneurship, water and sanitation, dairy processing, soil improvement and composting, and ICT training. Thus far, BIOCOOP has created more than 200 jobs, and improved nutrition and access to food sources. Over the next 5 years, BIOCOOP aims to create 5,000 jobs in Nyamagabe. \n\nBIOCOOP's flagship project is its dairy processing plant. By partnering with local farmers, BIOCOOP receives about 1,000 liters of milk per day, processes the milk, and sells the milk in the local market and at the neighboring refugee camp. At present, the demand for milk far exceeds BIOCOOP's current capacity to process milk. The main reason is that transporting raw milk from farther away farms to BIOCOOP's processing center is very costly and difficult without a vehicle.\n\nThis loan will enable BIOCOOP to purchase a tricycle motorcycle so that they can collect raw milk from farther away villages, process more, and sell the milk to more customers in the district. With this tricycle motorcycle, BIOCOOP will be able to increase from processing 1,000 liters to more than 3,000 liters per day.

He didn\u2019t have the opportunity to attend school and he is currently married.  His wife is a housewife and also works in a bakery.  He has three children who attend the local elementary school.\r\n\r\nPedro has been farming for 20 years and raises corn and beans.  He learned this from his father, and this allows him to support his family and generate income.  He sells 40% of his harvest to pay for other household needs.  He decided to continue farming since he inherited the land from his father.  His younger brother is also involved.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan to harvest and prepare his crops.  He will need to pay to transport his harvest to his home.  He will also pay to rent the machine he will use to thrash the corn.  The loan will help him speed up the harvest process.\r\n\r\nPedro\u2019s goals for the future are to pay off this loan and get another one to buy a corn thrasher, provide an education for his children because his son wants to be an agronomist and one of his daughters wants to be a nurse.  He will do it all with efficient use of his earnings from his harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1541417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Her husband and parents, everyone in her family, are business people, and so Inna had always dreamed of having her own business.  She takes her business seriously and people notice that.  And it's because of this, that she always has customers in her store.\r\n\r\nInna always tries to have the freshest goods and a large assortment of sweets for any taste.  Because her store is small, she has been looking for an opportunity to expand it.  Recently, Inna had the good fortune to have an opportunity to buy the kiosk next to her store.  She couldn't let such a good opportunity get away, so she decided to apply for a loan.  The loan she receives will help her to expand her business and then she will increase the size of her inventory.  Inna says that her \"customers will be better served which means that the profits will be

The business is going well and she spends the majority of her profits on her family.  \r\n\r\nLast year there was a wind storm that tore the plastic covering on her greenhouses and she lost part of her harvest.  Melinda is requesting a loan to buy plastic covering and do some other small repairs.\r\n\r\nMelinda is constantly increasing the size of her greenhouses.  Her dream is to expand her business enough that her entire family can be put to work.

She is the mother of three children. Her husband owns a clothing business; his practice is to buy uniforms from a wholesaler and sell them from his shop. He has many contacts with the various schools; their students like to buy uniforms from his shop.\r\n\r\nNowadays, a new badge has started in schools, and the demand for uniforms has increased, but he does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy more uniforms. Therefore, Shafqat has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband would be able to buy more uniforms to fulfill the demand.\r\n\r\nShe is in a repeated loan cycle and has been showing excellent repayment behavior; she has already been taking the loans from BRAC and investing in the business. Her dreams are for the bright future of her children, the establishment of the business and better living standards for her family.\r\n\r\nShe is very thankful to Kiva and field partner BRAC

a young woman of 36 years, married and the mother of 3 children between the ages of 1 and 7. Two of her children already attend school. Gisele has run a small call box in a neighborhood of the capital for 7 years and also owns a small stall from which she sells soap, stock cubes, sugar, salt, and other items. \r\n\r\nGisele buys calling credit from the telecom operators twice a week, on average. However, the demand for calls and credit is steadily increasing, and she is having problems fulfilling her customers' demands as her capital does not allow her to restock properly, which produces constant inventory problems and is causing her the gradual loss of her customers. \r\n\r\nGisele is requesting this loan so that she can get more calling credit which will enable her to retain and grow her customer base and, consequently, her profits. These profits will allow her to reinvest in her small stall in order to grow the business, and also to meet her family's needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1151551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy calling credit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2014-03-06T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-05T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gisele","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13954},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14448},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14940},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15434},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15926},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16420},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16912},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":17406},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":17899},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18392},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18885},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19384}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.65},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.65,"local_amount":13954,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-05T09:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479031732},{"amount":95.25,"local_amount":44822,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-04T09:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":45506.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520466189},{"amount":68.73,"local_amount":32346,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-31T09:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":32840.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542416291},{"amount":35.94,"local_amount":16912,"processed_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-03T10:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":17170.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561554167},{"amount":36.87,"local_amount":17406,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-13T11:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":17671.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.12,"payment_id":579459325},{"amount":35.9,"local_amount":17899,"processed_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-31T10:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":18172.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.14,"payment_id":595069969},{"amount":35.75,"local_amount":18392,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-03T10:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":18672.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.33,"payment_id":611711772},{"amount":33.75,"local_amount":18885,"processed_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-11T11:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.38,"payment_id":624435788},{"amount":35.67,"local_amount":19384,"processed_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-21T11:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":19680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.52,"payment_id":637178137}],"funded_date":"2014-03-07T05:04:22Z","paid_date":"2015-04-21T11:00:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Long Phillips","image":1429530}},{"id":678917,"name":"Shamim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamim is a 40-year-old woman.

Her husband has been manufacturing iron wire coils through melting cast iron. He buys iron scrap material from factories and puts it into high temperatures for melting and then reshaping. Wire is often reduced to the desired diameter and properties by repeated drawing through progressively smaller dies, or, traditionally, holes in draw plates. After a number of passes the wire may be annealed to facilitate more drawing or, if it is a finished product, to maximize ductility and conductivity.\r\n\r\nGul Bano has four children and she barely manages to satisfy their needs. She is required to provide them with good food, health, and education. She needs to earn sufficient income to support her family well. She is in her fifth loan cycle with BRAC Pakistan. Currently, she has requested a loan to buy cast iron for manufacturing so that her husband can increase his sales. She expects a boost in her earning and wishes to spend part of the profits on the expansion of her business.\r\nGul Bano is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1547351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal

He is responsible for feeding the entire family and managing the household.\r\n\r\nNigat's husband needs to purchase different types of fruits for resale so that he can increase the size of his business, improve his sales growth, and earn maximum profit. But due to an unfavorable financial position, he is not in the condition to purchase fruits for his business. Therefore Nigat has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband purchase the above items for his business. \r\n\r\nShe is very thankful to Kiva and

Dilshad is also providing sewing services and earns income to contribute to managing the household. \r\nShe needs different kinds of goods (e.g needles, threads, pieces of cloth, machine oil, etc.) for her business, but due to insufficient financial means she is unable to purchase these accessories. Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her to purchase these accessories and also help her to increase monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services.

Athumani successfully paid back his previous loans, which he used to improve his business by maintaining his daily demanded stock. He earned extra income, which he used to pay for some of his house building expenses and cover school fees and home expenses. He is really thankful to everyone who has shown interest in his group. Athumani dreams that one day he will be able to be a successful business man. \r\n\r\nHe will share this loan with his loan group \"Tupendane Kongowe\", which has four members.

She is married and has 8 children and has been farming for 30 years. She enjoys farming because it brings in a lot of profit, especially from selling eggs.  She also sells milk, bananas, and tea.

Currently, she is working hard every day to provide a better future for her children. \r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work and desire to get ahead, Juna has opened a small bookstore, a business that is located in a room of her home. She works offering her products approximately 10 hours a day. With the loan that she is asking for, she will stock her business with supplies such as notebooks, pencils, white-out, markers, crayons, cardboard, and colored paper, so that she can improve her income in the near future. Juana is very grateful for the help that KIVA lenders provide to low income people in poor countries like Nicaragua, so that borrowers can have a dignified way to make a living.

They are known to be hardworking, responsible, and eager to improve themselves. They enjoy spending their free time in the company of their children.

After her separation from her husband, she moved back to her parent\u2019s home to live with them. She is the featured profile member of the group and she is pictured with her hand raised in the group photo. The group that she joined is called Aster Group. Five women from Mizoram who are persistent and hardworking joined hands and formed the group. Mizoram is one of the northeastern states in India and the tribal community holds the major population in the state.\r\n\r\nC Lalhmangaihi was keen to take the leap to be financially independent and self made, but her primary level education could uphold her dreams and instead, she started her own business. She runs a petty shop in the neihborhood and generates income to support her and the family. She sells all essential commodities like rice, a variety of cereals, edible oil, onions, potatoes, candles, kerosene etc. She also sells beauty creams and other accessories like hair clips, hair bands and rubber bands. The peak hour is in the morning, so she opens her shop early in the morning at 6:00 am and usually closes at 10:00 pm. The shop is run solely by her and she hardly gets time to get back home and eat her lunch. So her family members usually come to her petty shop to give her lunch. She spends most of her time in the shop and closes down only if she has important family business. Twice a month, she purchases stock for the shop from the main market in town at the wholesale rate. The generated income is insufficient to manage both the household expenses and shop expenses, which usually forces C Lalhmangaihi to buy the supplies on credit and pay for them later. Trust and loyalty are the most important things to run a business, says C Lalhmangaihi. \r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva loan, she will purchase supplies for the whole month, sell them and earn an income. She will only remarry and settle down once again when she is fully financially stable and capable of running the business without getting loans. She will work very hard and give all her time to make the business a success. She is also planning to expand the shop and continue the business until the end. She says \u201c KA LAWM LUTUK\u201d, which means I am so thankful. The other members of the group are also engaged in running grocery shops and other income-generating activities.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1547544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more supplies like beauty creams, shampoo sachets and edible oils ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"aizawl","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-03-06T22:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-05T22:50:07Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zonunmawii","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"C Lalhmangaihi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodinpuii","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalruatmawii","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalramnuami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T08:05:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":677275,"name":"Maria Altagracia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\n\n\n\n\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Altagracia es una mujer muy trabajadora de 51 a\u00f1os de edad, responsable, dedicada a su familia, hogar y sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 los cuales es la \u00fanica fuente de ingresos para el bienestar de su familia.

For 10 years, she has made and sold manti (Turkish ravioli), borek (savory pastry), stuffed grape leaves, tarhana (preserved yogurt soup), jellies and pepper and tomato sauces. She first began by selling to friends and relatives. They liked her products because they had a homemade, \"like Mom used to make\", taste. She ships orders.  In the summer, expatriates from Germany, the US, UK, and Czech Republic buy her products to take home. Her daughter is studying food engineering and will help her mother when she finishes her studies. \u00d6m\u00fcr sells from her home and sometimes at markets.

Her husband has been working in a cement factory for many years, and is responsible for meeting the needs of the family. Nargis contributes to management of their house hold by providing sewing services to earn an income. \r\n\r\nNargis needs different kinds of goods for her business (needles, threads, pieces of cloth, machine oil, etc.), but due to insufficient financial means she is unable to purchase these accessories. Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Warm, kind-hearted and soft-spoken, Lalfakawmi is the featured borrower for Bagonia Group. She is pictured with her hand raised. She is a mother of two kids, runs a beauty salon, and also supports her husband in generating an income for the family.  Bagonia Group members live in Mizoram. It is one of the northeastern states in India.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love the art of beautifying especially women,\u201d shares Lalfakawmi. She is talented, skillful and interested in her profession. She can trim and cut hair, give facial massage, pedicure, manicure treatment, hair spa etc. The salon is in her house and customers usually come to the house for the treatment. The service charge is low compared to the salon shop in the main market, which is a disadvantage in generating an income. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a daily wage earner and his income is small, irregular and unreliable.  Lalfakawmi manages the salon and at the same time takes care of all the household chores. The salon is at its busiest during weekends as most of the government offices and other institutions are closed. Working women visit the salon on weekends only. On other days, she also sells used clothes and Tupperware products to make extra income.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva loan, she will purchase beauty products and accessories which will include pedicure kits and parlour chairs. She has plans to expand her salon and before that, she will take another hair and beauty refresher course. She says, \u2018Thank you so much, Kiva!\u201d and says she is more inspired and motivated to make her dreams come true. Her dream is to open a standard beauty salon in the heart of Aizawl town. She will work very hard and will also repay the loan on time. The relationship between Kiva and the group will also be strengthened and she wishes to continue working with Kiva and WSDS.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in tailoring and

She is married to Brojen who is a 55-year-old farmer.  They are blessed with three children (two sons and one daughter).  One of the sons is a mason, the other goes to college and their only daughter is in grade 12. Chhabi, though illiterate, can sign her name.\r\n\r\nIn search of a source of funding for her family, Chhabi's husband started his agricultural activities 10 years back.  He works hard on his agricultural land from dawn to dusk to earn a livelihood for his family.  He grows different vegetables in different seasons and sells the harvest in the local market with the help of Chhabi and his children.  Yet, his income is hardly sufficient to give a decent lifestyle to the members of his family.\r\n\r\nTo further develop their agribusiness, Chhabi has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase potato seeds and fertilizers.  She hopes to improve the business with the loan.  Potato is a very important vegetable that is used widely in India.  So they hope to earn a good profit from this business.  She dreams of fulfilling her desires to give a proper education to her children so that they can be established in life.  The additional profit will help them to cover all the necessary expenses and she hopes to purchase a tractor in the future with the profit, which will help them in their work.\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to Kiva and BJS.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1547603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase potato seeds for cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-03-07T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-06T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chhabi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-07T12:41:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":679099,"name":"Murad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Murad is 27 years old; he lives in Gaza with his family, only one of whom is employed and helping him in providing the family income.\r\nIn the first of May 2010, Murad opened his own barbershop.

She lives with her husband and 3 school-aged daughters. Nato's husband had a small car parts business, which is temporarily suspended. The 5-member family's current income comes from Nato's private activity, working as a dressmaker. Unfortunately, this is hardly enough to meet basic needs and daily costs.

She lives with her husband and three children (two sons and one daughter).  Her husband Rafikul, aged 40 years, is a trader of cows. One of their sons and their daughter go to school and are in grade 5 and 4; the third child is below school-going age. They live in their own kachha house (made of mud, straw, wood and bamboo) in Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nFarida's husband is associated with buying and selling cattle, especially cows. It is a revenue-generating business. With a solid 15 years of experience in this business, he buys cows from wholesale markets and resells them in local markets. He is the main breadwinner for the family. Due to the growing increase in the prices of essential commodities, it is now difficult for him to cover the family\u2019s needs. He needs to expand his business in order to satisfy his customers, who are in ever-growing numbers.\r\n\r\nFarida has taken a loan from BJS. She will utilize the loan to purchase another cow. This will increase their income, which will be used to meet her family\u2019s needs, children's educational expenses, and in the future, to upgrade their house to a concrete-made house.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to a Kiva and BJS for funding the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1547621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Her husband attended school up to grade 8.\r\n\r\nThe family is engaged in agriculture. They rent a plot of land where vegetables are cultivated. Unfortunately, because of financial difficulties, Sabli and her family are not able to purchase and have their own land. They gather the harvest, sell it in the nearby markets and get money, which is their only source of income. In order to grow their business for more income, they have decided to cultivate potatoes.\r\n\r\nSabli has taken a loan from BJS to be able to purchase potato seeds and fertilizers to start growing potatoes. It is a very important vegetable, so they hope to earn a good profit from it. This will enable her to support her family economically and save a little money to upgrade their kachha house to a concrete-made house.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to BJS and

She started benefiting from renewable energy in 2012, having bought her first solar lamp, and thereafter she bought two more lamps. Happily, she shares with us how much she has enjoyed life while using a solar lantern which has helped her save at least 50% of the money she previously used on kerosene. The lamps that she bought are used to light the sitting room for her children to study, the kitchen and the master bedroom. Now, she does not need to buy kerosene anymore for lighting. <br \/><br \/>Her neighbors, having seen her lamp, have been sending her to buy on their behalf, and out of this, she saw an opportunity. She decided to stock the lamps in her shop so that she could make a margin, and at the same time, the customers can access the lamps easily. VEP has advanced her a business loan that would enable her purchase the first few months' stock, plowing back the profit while repaying the loan to grow the business. She hopes that she will be the biggest retailer of solar lamps in her community in the next year. The added income from the sale of the lanterns will improve the family's financial
