She runs a petty shop and sells all essential commodities. She sells detergent soap, detergent powder, biscuits, bakery goods, candles, onions, ginger, small sachet shampoos etc. Sometimes, she places an order for good quality rice from the neighboring states and sells it.  Customers usually demand better quality rice and she makes sure that it is available in the shop. The rice from the neighboring states can sell out instantly and is in high demand. \r\n\r\nShe gets the supplies for the shop from the main market from wholesalers and sells them at a good profit. Her main source of income is the petty shop.  The shop is generally re-stocked twice in a month at the minimum. She opens her shop every morning at 7:00 am and closes at 5:00 pm. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she is planning to get more materials for her petty shop, expand the shop, and generate more income. She aspires to become one of the successful woman shop owners in the neighborhood and wishes to have a house that she and her daughters can call home for themselves. At present, she lives at her parent\u2019s house. She is delighted to work with Kiva and wishes to continue the relationship. She says, \u201cThank you so much Kiva\u201d.

To sell firewood, they need to purchase wood and logs and then cut it into pieces to sell in the market.

The family relies entirely on her husband\u2019s meager income. Her husband is a government employee. Though her husband is a government servant, his income alone can not meet the family\u2019s expenses because he does not get his salary on a regular basis.Therefore, they fall short of money to pay the children\u2019s monthly school expenses and to meet the family\u2019s basic requirements. \r\n\r\nHence, Vanlalnghaki started her own business to raise more income for the family. She buys betel nut and leaf in a large quantity and usually prepares it at home at nighttime. Her husband helps her with the preparations and packing and then the next day, he takes some of the prepared tobacco (pan) to the office to sell. In the mean time, Vanlalnghaki distributes her packed tobacco to her clients and to some other small petty shops including her regular customers. With her WSDS loan, Vanlalnghaki wishes to expand her tobacco business by introducing attractive packaging and raising the tobacco quality. Since, it\u2019s almost like a staple food in Aizawl, there\u2019s a huge demand. Due to a shortage of money, she can't buy more stock though she has lots of demands. But with the loan, she will purchase more stock and start supplying in bulk.

They are from Malpaisillo which is located in the northern region.  They are known for being hard-working, responsible people who are determined to get ahead.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources, they were unable to get an education and had to go to work to help cover household expenses.  Nowadays, they struggle daily to give their children a better future and to see them become professionals and good citizens.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts to get ahead, the coordinator of the group is Paula.  She runs a small grocery store and sells small amounts of food such as rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, detergent, corn, vegetables, ice, matches, juices and cookies.  She works 12 hours a day selling her products out of the store set up in her home.  The purpose of the loan is to use it as work capital to buy and sell more products so she can earn more income.  The \"Dios Me Fortalece\" Group is grateful to Kiva lenders who help people with low incomes and poor countries like Nicaragua to have dignified work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3800,"image":{"id":1542526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy goods such as rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, detergent, corn, vegetables, ice, matches, juices and cookies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-03-07T08:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-06T08:40:01Z","loan_amount":3800,"lender_count":128,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacinta Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heysell Jessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jairo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lester Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":97000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":643.9,"local_amount":16436.4,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T14:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":16454.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467955774},{"amount":642.85,"local_amount":16409.68,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":16428.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176540},{"amount":952.32,"local_amount":24309.25,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":24336.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490871181},{"amount":637.69,"local_amount":16277.87,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":16296.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298429},{"amount":635.48,"local_amount":16221.5,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":16239.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517581260},{"amount":287.76,"local_amount":7345.3,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":7353.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530064559}],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T17:07:13Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:07:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":679295,"name":"Mikpamahu-Pouce Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement MIKPAMAHU-POUCE est compos\u00e9 de neuf personnes qui vivent dans le m\u00eame village.

Six years ago in order to generate more income for the household economy, she decided to open a small grocery store which worked well during some time.  But, little by little, sales began to drop and she had to close the business.  Nevertheless, she had the strength to continue on and began to sell a worldwide known brand of products by catalogue.  Thanks to her work, sales are consistent and she is able to help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy discount products (body lotions, personal hygiene products, vitamins, dietary supplements and other items).

Sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 est\u00e1n ubicados a 3 kil\u00f3metros de distancia desde su casa habitaci\u00f3n a los cuales se trasladan caminando para dar asistencia y mantenimiento a sus cultivos de caf\u00e9.\nSus sue\u00f1os y esperanzas buscar la superaci\u00f3n cada d\u00eda, salir adelante a pesar de los diferentes obst\u00e1culos y aprovechar cada oportunidad que se le es presentada para crecer. Como madre de familia apoyar a su hija en todo lo necesario, darle la oportunidad de estudiar para que ella pueda tener un mejor futuro y una mejor condici\u00f3n de vida. Mar\u00eda Marina actualmente solicita apoyo financiero ya que necesita asistir sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 esperando ser apoyada por los inversionistas en la plataforma KIVA para cubrir la necesidad de comprar fertilizantes, abono, foliares, entre otros que ayudaran al cuidado y desarrollo de sus cultivos de caf\u00e9.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda Marina is a 21 year old young woman. She is very hard working and has a desire to get ahead. She is a humble and very respected person in her community who is married and lives with her husband and their only daughter who is small and does not yet attend school. Both work at farming coffee as well as other crops like maize and beans. Since she was young, she liked working in agriculture with her parents since they introduced this job to her since after finishing elementary school they could not keep supporting her to continue school since their economic resources weren't the best. Her coffee crops are located 3km distance from her house which she walks to in order to tend and maintain the plants.\r\n\r\nHer dreams and hopes are to look to overcome each day, to get ahead despite the different obstacles and take advantage of each opportunity that is presented to her to grow. As a mother, to support her daughter in everything necessary and give her the opportunity to study so she can have a better future and a better quality of life. Maria Marina currently is requesting the financial support since she needs to attend to her coffee crops and is hoping to be supported by the investors on the Kiva platform to cover the need to buy fertilizers, among other items that will help with the care and development of her coffee crops.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1543856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizers for her coffee plants.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Gracias, Lempira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-03-07T17:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-06T17:30:08Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10263.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624827050}],"funded_date":"2014-03-07T17:41:41Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T09:59:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":679268,"name":"Cosmas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Cosmas, a resident of the Kisii area of Nyanza, Kenya! \r\n\r\nHe is a family man with 4 children.

Only her husband and her children live with her. \r\n\r\nThe work Candelaria does is buying and selling basic grains such as corn and beans. She buys as soon as the grain has been harvested, to get it at a cheaper price, and sells it soon afterwards at the regular or higher price. She has been trading for 2 years, having learnt the business on her own initiative as she did not have any work at the time. Sometimes she travels 1km to go to buy the grain and when she is selling the grain, people come to her to take it back to their house. Before she was in business she just did the household tasks. Her husband and children help her with her business. \r\n\r\nCandelaria is asking for the loan to buy 8 quintals of corn and 7 quintals of beans and will use the remainder to pay off an outstanding loan with Credicampo so she can be solvent. The loan will help her as she will be able to buy more cheaply and then quickly make a profit from her investment, which will help her to bring up her family. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to finish building her home one day, so that her children can live more comfortably without worrying about getting wet in the rainy season.

Iris is a very enterprising lady who set up a corn mill in her home with great effort.  She uses her earnings from her small business to help her husband with the household expenses.  Her husband works at another mill in town.  Iris is excited about improving her humble home because she and her husband have decided to install a tile floor.  The current one is dirt, as shown in the photo.  It is asking for a loan through FUSAI to buy tiles, cement, and sand.

comercio y a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos, es propietaria de una mini tienda en la que vende productos de primera necesidad y productos de medicina natural, ya tiene una experiencia de 15 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad que fue producto de la ense\u00f1anza de su madre, la cual en aquellos tiempos lo realizaban los d\u00edas domingos en la plaza del pueblo y los dem\u00e1s d\u00edas de la semana se dedicaban al trabajo agr\u00edcola, es por eso que hoy en d\u00eda Mar\u00eda se dedica al comercio, pues le motivan las ganancias que este le deja, aparte de que no tiene que movilizarse a

old and lives in a hamlet. She only studied as far as fourth grade since her family had very little money. She is single and does not have any children. Mar\u00eda is a very hard-working person. She runs a business and does domestic work. She owns a small shop where she sells everyday groceries and natural health products. She has been doing this for 15 years, having been taught by her mother. In those days they used to sell the products in the town square every Sunday and during the rest of the week they did agricultural work. This is why Mar\u00eda now runs a business, as she is motivated by the profits which it gives her. As well as this she does not have to travel to work as she runs the business from her home, and this gives her time to look after her parents who are elderly.  She is the one who looks after them since she is the only daughter.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is asking for this loan so she can extend and improve her house. She has already started to put in a bathroom and needs to finish it so that her house can have basic sanitation. She will use another part of the loan to buy goods for her shop. This will enable her to stock the shop better and provide a better service for her customers, which will improve her profits. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's plans for the future are to strengthen her business and have bigger premises which will allow her to start selling pupusas [thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, fried pork rind, chicken, or refried beans] on weekday afternoons. She also plans to support her nephews in their education so they can become professional graduates.

Richard hopes that in the future, he will be able to acquire more assets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":802.37,"image":{"id":1544921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy more maize flour, cassava flour and cooking oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Fort Portal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2014-03-07T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-06T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":45.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":210463},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":234104},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":189210},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":170102},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":176247},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":182613},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":196044},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":203126},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":218066},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":225943},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":251522},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242560}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.85,"local_amount":210463,"processed_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":212399.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.34,"payment_id":595122543},{"amount":89.92,"local_amount":234104,"processed_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":236257.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.72,"payment_id":595122544},{"amount":73.45,"local_amount":189210,"processed_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":190950.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.23,"payment_id":612145839},{"amount":63.58,"local_amount":170102,"processed_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":171666.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.46,"payment_id":626568717},{"amount":65.88,"local_amount":176247,"processed_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":177868.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.62,"payment_id":626568718},{"amount":68.26,"local_amount":182613,"processed_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":184293.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.78,"payment_id":626568719},{"amount":73.28,"local_amount":196044,"processed_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":197847.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.14,"payment_id":626568720},{"amount":75.92,"local_amount":203126,"processed_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:02:12Z","rounded_local_amount":204994.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.33,"payment_id":626568721},{"amount":81.51,"local_amount":218066,"processed_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":220072.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.72,"payment_id":626568722},{"amount":84.46,"local_amount":225943,"processed_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":228021.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.92,"payment_id":626568723}],"funded_date":"2014-04-06T16:23:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":679305,"name":"Mwanaisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanaisha is a divorced woman with two school-going children.

beautiful Lake Atitlan in the highlands of Guatemala. The population is Tz'utujil, one of many distinctive indigenous Mayan groups found in the country. Agriculture, mainly high quality coffee, is grown in this area. The town sees an increasing number of tourists each year, drawn by several women\u2019s textile cooperatives, the natural dye techniques used by the women as well as distinctive paintings by many talented artists.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cDel Carmen\u201d is located here. One member of the Trust Bank is Do\u00f1a Zoila, a hard working 56 year old woman who produces beautiful textiles. She is pleased that her efforts have resulted in some much needed income so that she can successfully raise her seven children. Do\u00f1a Zoila is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge which she will use to purchase high quality materials including thread and fabric. Her goal is to increase her inventory and earn more income. She is a busy mother with seven mouths to feed!\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Zoila is most aware that education is an essential component for her success. One year ago, she completed her primary education and now she is proud to have some basic skills. Recognizing this, her fellow Trust Bank members have chosen Do\u00f1a Zoila to be President of the group. \r\n\r\nEducational trainings are a key component in the Micro-credit Plus program of Friendship Bridge. Each month, a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank officer meets with each Trust Bank. Besides taking care of loan business, she presents a non-formal educational training.

To improve her living conditions and to earn some extra income she wants to access a loan.  From the loan she will purchase mirrors, combs, beauty creams, face wash creams, soaps, etc., as Fancy items from a nearby wholesale market (Raipur) for her shop at a cheaper rate.  She has a dream to buy a stall from her income and educate her son in a better school.\n\nThe other 11 members of her groups are Nalini, Rebati, Sashikala, Sangita, Snehalata, Sima, Sabita, Arati, Sadhabani, Arati and Susmita.

named Dilbar.  She is 32 years old.  She and her mother live in the district of Rudaki.  Dilbar did not receive a higher education - she is more fond of sewing.  Her mother taught her to sew and to tailor, and for 12 years now Dilbar has been filling orders for hand sewn curtains.  Dilbar likes the process of her work.  She has an old sewing machine, which often breaks.  Frequent break-downs impede her work, but she does not have sufficient funds to purchase a new sewing machine.  For this reason she decided to take out a loan.  She hopes, that with your help, she can purchase her long-awaited sewing

She has a partner who works as a security guard for a factory. They live alone, since their children all have partners.\n\nShe works raising beef cattle. She learned this work because she did not know how to do anything else, and due lack of education she could never find decent employment. Every day in the morning she drives her animals for almost 2 kilometers until arriving at the pasture, and in the afternoon she brings them back to the house.\n\nThe loan she is requesting from CrediCampo is to buy a cow that is close to giving birth in order to obtain daily income from the sale of milk and to cover other needs of her family.\n\nReina plans to work very hard in order to save and buy 7,000 square meters of land to pasture her animals and grow

Business Administration. Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a freshmen student of AUCA from Tajikistan. Tajikistan's economy is not stable and needs specialists to develop it economically. For this, the country needs young and energetic people who would bring change to the country so that most of the migrants could come back from Russia and be employed locally. Therefore, my goal is to study and be part of the team who are ready to sacrifice their time and contribute towards prosperity of their country.\r\n\r\nI want to be a leader in my society, to lead the communities towards a better life through seeking opportunities to create employment.  I would be able to achieve my goal through studying at a university such as the American University of Central Asia. AUCA is one of the most prestigious universities in whole central Asia . The alumni of this university, today, are working in governmental and non-governmental organizations and are leaders in societies.\r\n\r\nI liked being a part of the school team who have been volunteering in different activities. Since 2011, I have actively been engaged in the school life and organized different activities; for example, in 2012 I was leading the team who was responsible for organizing a 'high-school winter ball' event for students finishing school. I actively volunteered in the Aga-Khan health service organization (AKHS) as a finance assistant. Sometimes I translated for foreign workers, who came from other countries.  It is my pleasure to help other people, and the most perfect thing about my volunteering is that I got a lot of experience in the field of financing by watching how other people work in this field. Moreover, I volunteer in a civil society club; as a volunteer, I have been participating in a fund raising project to help disabled children with buying books and drawing accessories so that they would also be part of the society and not ignored. So, an AUCA education will be an invaluable experience contributing to the long run to the fulfillment of my career goals.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":1548178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

producci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de productos elaborados bajo la t\u00e9cnica  de Vitrofusi\u00f3n, utilizando materiales de vidrio reciclables, aportando as\u00ed un beneficio al medio ambiente. \n\nLa Vitrofusi\u00f3n es el arte de moldear el vidrio someti\u00e9ndolo a altas temperaturas en hornos especiales, obteniendo objetos y accesorios de gran belleza gracias al color aplicado y a la transparencia del material, con un toque de creatividad. Se trata de una t\u00e9cnica propia del siglo XX, ya que requiere contar con una herramienta muy especial que es el horno de termo formado, que toma las piezas de vidrio y las moldea para generar elementos \u00fanicos e innovadores.\n\nEKOFUSION es una alternativa de acceso a la actividad productiva,  apropiada para mujeres que por su condici\u00f3n de vulnerabilidad, y su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica, no han podido  accesar a estudios superiores, lo cual sumado al desempleo del pa\u00eds, obliga a buscar un desarrollo econ\u00f3mico y social. Ileana, es la presidenta del grupo, madre de 2 hijos, busca apoyar econ\u00f3micamente a su familia con este negocio, trabaja durante las ma\u00f1anas y dedica la tarde a la comercializaci\u00f3n. Trabaja en el taller y otras 2 compa\u00f1eras asisten a ferias a promocionar el producto en las comunidades cercanas.\n\nCon este proyecto se quiere abrir una puerta de esperanza para el  desarrollo y formaci\u00f3n, generando una soluci\u00f3n no s\u00f3lo econ\u00f3mica sino asegurando calidad de vida, y generaci\u00f3n de empleo a corto plazo.\n\nAl mismo tiempo se aporta beneficio al cuidado del medio ambiente al utilizar materiales reciclables como botellas y vidrio reciclado, estas se obtienen en la comunidad a un costo m\u00ednimo y ayudan a los vecinos ense\u00f1ando la manera de reciclar el vidrio y contribuyen a disminuir la contaminaci\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Ekofusion Group<br \/>San Antonio de Bel\u00e9n, Heredia<br \/><br \/>This group is made up of five women who belong to the same family. They are developing alternatives that contribute to the improvement in their quality of life through the production and sale of products made through the Vitrofusi\u00f3n technique, which uses recycled glass materials. This supports the well being of the environment. <br \/><br \/>Vitrofusi\u00f3n is the art of molding glass by using high temperatures in special ovens. It produces very beautiful accessories and objects due to the colors applied and the transparency of the material, with a touch of creativity. It is a unique 20th century technique, as it requires a very special tool, a thermoformed oven, that takes the pieces of glass and molds them to create special and innovative items.<br \/><br \/>Ekofusion is an alternative for working women to access a productive business given their vulnerability and financial circumstances. They were unable to access higher education, which, together with the unemployment in the country, pushed them to find economic and social opportunities on their own.<br \/><br \/>Ileana, one of the members of this group, is a mother of two children. She wants to support her family financially with this business. They work in the mornings, and in the afternoons they sell their product.

She learned this job when she was a little girl from her parents, who are farmers by family tradition.  The land Miriam farms is her own, thanks to a family inheritance.  It's located 10 kilometers from her house so she gets there on the community bus.  Her customers have warehouses devoted exclusively to buying and selling coffee in other areas near where she lives.\n\nMiriam has a second source of income from raising pigs, which she keeps behind her house.\n\nShe's asking the COMIXMUL cooperative for a loan so she can buy soil amendments, fertilizer, foliars, and other agricultural supplies to help protect her coffee crops and get an excellent harvest.\n\nMiriam's greatest desire and biggest dream is for her children to graduate from college so they can take care of themselves.  This is the best legacy she can give them.

This is her story:\r\n\u201cICP program is very interesting for me. I think it is very important and good to know the problems and news of different governments in the world as politicians enact legislation which regulates vital processes of the citizens. For example, as for our government, two of our presidents had run away during the revolutions which caused instability in Kyrgyzstan. In my opinion, we have too many deputies in our little country and most of them just rest in the government. If we had some new, modern, well-educated and practiced young politicians, who could bring forth the new ideas and be able to govern properly, Kyrgyzstan would have been investment-attractive and developed.\r\nTherefore I have chosen to study ICP at AUCA. AUCA education is very qualified and I am sure that I will get real knowledge here. Since the University is  international, I strongly believe that I would have a chance to participate in presentations of peer students who will share their experience that would greatly influence my knowledge and expertise. I would have a chance to understand my world better through listening to others. As my mother is the only one who supports our family, I am in need of Kiva loan.

He wants to buy new tires and do some engine maintenance for his vehicle. This will help him drive more smoothly and provide better transport service for his passengers.

He does not have a drill machine for well digging so he has been renting a drill machine. Now, he wants to buy a well drill machine and some new tools such as a wrench, tube cutter, pipe threader, tube flaring, soldering torch, tile spade, shovel, digging bar etc. to continue his services but he does not have enough cash on hand.

He really enjoys feeding his dairy cows so that they become more productive. His biggest challenge is feeding his animals during dry seasons.\r\nAbraham chose Juhudi Kilimo for his loan because they target small-holder farmers in improving their livelihoods and he wants to improve his livelihood. During the training, he learned how to develop a savings mentality. The output from this loan will cause his dairy cows to produce more milk for him to sell and hence generate more income. This will help him pay his children's school fees and also improve their living standards.

The manager gave her the option of doing Saturday shifts so that she would have time to work and study; she was delighted to accept the offer.

Their principal activities are agriculture and livestock raising, but others embroider traditional garments of the region. \n\nNancy is the only breadwinner in her household. Her children and the other family members who live in her house help her with the work on her farm and caring for the animals (cows, sheep, pigs, etc).

She is taking care of her grandkids who are still in school. She is aged mid forties and is single. For six years now, Bijeli has made her living by running a mamalishe business selling rice, stiff porridge with meat, fish, vegetables and beans. Bijeli learned this business after her life seemed to be becoming hard, but still her mamalishe itself does not provide a satisfactory income. Later on, she introduced a local drinks (Komoni and Chibuku) business so as to increase her income. Now, she also manages another business selling local drinks like Komoni and Chibuku. She opens her business from 6am to 11pm each working day and is able to make a good profit per month. \r\n\r\nBijeli used to be a client of Tujijenge a long time ago when the company commenced. She stopped taking loans after her shake business had a high fall in sales. Since Bijeli started taking loans again, this is her third loan request. She will use this loan to buy ten crates of local drinks and food ingredients for cooking including kilos of rice, sugar, beans, etc. With her previous loans, all of which she paid back successfully, she used the funds to start her mamalishe business and restock the food items. Bijeli managed to earn an extra income which she used to buy a TV, radio and house sofa set. She also covered school fees and home food expenses.
