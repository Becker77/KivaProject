Rafael learned this business by starting and operating it, and managed to cover his family's basic expenses. \r\n\r\nRafael now has the opportunity to take over an established and well-stocked grocery store. He needs, however, to purchase additional wholesale goods (grains, sugar, beer, soda, pastries, dairy products) and make repairs (plaster and paint the walls). These purchases and improvements will allow Rafael to launch his new business project and improve the store's image. He'll be able to offer a greater variety of goods to meet his customers' needs and preferences, increasing his income so he can provide a better quality of life for his family. \r\n\r\nRafael says that taking over this store would be the fulfillment of a dream. He's always wanted to have his own business in a site that's open to the public, thus avoiding the risks that come from working on the street. Rafael also believes that the shop will be much more profitable than his old business. He wants to achieve a degree of financial stability that will allow him to keep striving for the well-being of his family.   \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1544843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase wholesale goods and make repairs to his new store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Itagui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-03-08T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-07T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rafael Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":6000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179465},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184428},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189529},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194770},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200156},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205692},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211380},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217226},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223233},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229407},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":235751},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242271},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248971},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255856},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262932},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270203},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277675},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285355},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293246},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301356},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309690},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318254},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327056},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":336098}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.18},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephen Volante","image":1247673}},{"id":680269,"name":"Tea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tea is 37 years old, married, has one child, and lives in the small village of Senaki district with her husband, son, and pensioner mother-in-law.

At 28 years old, he is already the owner of his own business, a sewing workshop that he started about 8 years ago. He learned the trade from his mother who has worked in it all her life. He started out collaborating with her, and soon after he inherited some machines which allowed him to become independent. Little by little he acquired good customers and with the profits he bought other machines. He now makes enough income to cover the basic costs of his home. <br \/><br \/>His main motivation is to be able to grow his business, which is what pushed him to ask for a loan in order to buy a holemaking machine. This way he can increase his capacity and will be able to speed up and optimize production time, with the goal of completing orders for his customers and opening the door for new contracts. <br \/><br

Her business is open from 6 am to 11 pm per working day and is able to make a very good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis is Zawadi's first loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania.  Zawadi will use this loan to buy utensils like cups, sauce pans, plates and food ingredients for business purposes.  She dreams in the coming years that she will be able to buy a private car and build a daycare and primary school.  She will share this loan with her loan group \"TWIGA\" which consists of five members.  The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

He is married and has four children, all of school-going age. He has been farming for over 20 years and his income comes from selling milk, eggs and tea. He also has a retail business.

She, together with her partner, manages their household while operating the business. She and her partner work hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nMa. Aurita maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands, such as Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is paid for in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 37,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. \r\n\r\nMa. Aurita dreams of having her own store for her products and hopes to give her child a good life and education.

","en":"Giovanna Patricia (Johana)was born on May 1st. Her mother, Aid\u00e9, lived with her aunt because Johana's father, Joaqu\u00edn, wasn't in the picture. Johana's mom helped her aunt with the kids while her aunt worked. Johana was like a younger sister to Alexis and Camilo and they were inseparable until they turned 5, when Aid\u00e9 and Johana decided to move to the country where another aunt, In\u00e9s, lived. They stayed there for a few months and later moved in with Johana's uncle Mario, who has since died. They stayed there for 4 years and Johana attended a year of preschool.<br \/><br \/>One day, Aid\u00e9's grandmother, Johana's grandmother, told Aid\u00e9 to come to her farm. Aid\u00e9 accepted and they moved there, where Aid\u00e9 put Johana in school. She stayed there through primary school. Johana left school in 2006, in 9th grade, because she wanted to work. She decided to go to another city, known for the best oranges in the country. She tried to work and to study but she didn't have time. She entered into a serious relationship with a chubby boy named Ariel. Ariel missed the land, and proposed to Johana that they leave to go there. The enamored pair decided to leave for a year, and when they returned in 2010 Johana was pregnant. Her family helped her, but her boyfriend did not support her. Seeing that he wasn't helping, she decided to leave him. Aid\u00e9 and her aunts helped Johana to finish her schooling, but in that moment all she wanted was to have her baby, whom she named Felipe. <br \/> <br \/>She eventually began to study in the Merced school at night, working and looking after the baby during the day. She finished high school, but the next year she wasn't able to study because of financial problems and Felipe's health. <br \/><br \/>This year she wants to study because she will be able to give her baby a better future, and also to teach Felipe that you can do things that seem difficult. The agreement with Kiva will be of great help to her, since she is a single mother and her monthly expenses are costly. With the loan she will be able to reduce her expenses a little and finish her degree."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1545477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester's tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-09T01:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-08T01:40:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovanna Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":153901.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882866},{"amount":150,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":307803,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202231},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":153901.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286372},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":153901.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225079}],"funded_date":"2014-03-09T13:21:33Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":680430,"name":"Josefa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefa is 60 years old with four grown-up children.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to pay for cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 25,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nJonelle dreams that her business will grow bigger and hopes that her family will always stick together.

After a couple years there however, she realized that there was a glass ceiling for women in the company and there was a lot of resistance to her progress in the company. These challenges eventually led Jessica to go into business for herself as a real estate agent. \r\n\r\nGrowing up, Jessica always admired her grandfather who was a real estate investor and thus took a keen interest in the real estate market. A San Diego native, Jessica is bubbly and down to earth and loves working with people. She finds it extremely rewarding to see the satisfaction and joy in the lives of new homebuyers. For Jessica, it\u2019s not just about closing the deal, but helping people find their dream home.\r\n\r\nThis $10,000 Kiva loan will help Jessica with her marketing expenses and allow her to hire an assistant to help support her growing business. Jessica needs to get her name out there so that she can continue building her solid reputation in the community. She hopes to find her niche working with professional athletes and large corporations and dreams to be the \u201cgo-to real estate agent\u201d in San Diego. \r\n\r\nJessica, a married mother of three, hopes that her growing business will allow her to continue providing for her family. She also wants to continue supporting Give Back Homes, a social enterprise that provides a platform for business professionals such as real estate agents to make contributions to building homes for

get ahead. Unfortunately, he could only study through 4th grade. He is single and doesn't have children. Juan has been baking bread for many years. He learned the trade through attending workshops and later decided to buy an oven to start his own bread business. This helped him to perfect his technique, which is very important to him since this is how he earns his income to take care of himself. <br \/><br \/>He needs this loan to buy flour and other products needed for making bread.

She is married and lives with her husband and young son in a house she has owned for 8 years.  She left school after the sixth grade.  She is grateful, she says, that her parents kept her in school for so long, but she had to leave after the sixth grade because her parents didn't have the money for her to continue.  She had to go to work, something that was especially hard for her, a woman, in a society that discriminates against women.  She was luckier in the man she married, a man who loves and respects her and shares her sensibilities.  Her husband, Luis, is as enterprising and hard-working as she is.  They married when they were young and have worked together, shoulder to shoulder, to make a life for themselves and their son.  \r\n\r\nSilvia has a scrap business.  She learned the business from her in-laws who, she says, are good, hard-working people who have tried to instill the importance of getting ahead in her and her husband.  Silvia works every day, rain or shine, but still manages to make time for her husband and son.  They are a team and their love and faith in one another has been an important reason for their success.  \r\n\r\nSilvia says that the business has grown over the last few months and she has a good customer base now.  She needs more scrap to sell and is applying for a loan partly to stock the business.  She will use the rest of the loan to finish the roof on her small house.  The investment will help her to increase her income and improve her family's standard of living.  She wants lenders to know that she is sincerely grateful for their support and sends her thanks to Fundacion Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for helping her grow her

He comes from the parish of Machachi, in the canton of Mejia, in the Ecuadorian capital.  He now lives in the parish of Pastocalle.  Life dealt him a blow at a very young age when his parents died, and he became an orphan at the age of 11. He had to go to live with relatives far away. Jhon has suffered a lot; his world collapsed when he was left without the people who gave him life, and it is ironic that life then robbed him of these people.  For this reason and due to a lack of financial resources he was only able to complete primary school.  However, Jhon showed everyone that he was able to get ahead.  He could have taken a bad path, but his desire to be something more in life was stronger, and he did not allow himself to be influenced by bad friends.  Instead, he joined an organization in the parish of Pastocalle, where they helped him to learn activities such as raising animals (chickens, pigs, sheep, etc.)  This was the first step for Jhon, who dedicated himself to learning so that he could earn some income and support himself.  Jhon's main dream is to meet a good, hardworking  woman some day who will fill him with love, and with whom he can create the beautiful family that he never had.  With the experience that Jhon acquired over the years, and the growth in the sale of pigs in recent years, he feels ready to take a step forward.  For this reason he is requesting a loan, that he will use to buy pigs and to finish a small construction project. In this way he can increase his sales and income and improve his lifestyle.  Jhon is grateful to the Fundacion Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making this growth possible in his work and his personal life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1545501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more pigs and to finish a construction project.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2014-03-09T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-08T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Orphan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhon Darwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1108.95,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":69.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":87.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":98.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":102.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.81},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.26,"local_amount":69.26,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":70.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212348},{"amount":87.71,"local_amount":86.46,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138334},{"amount":88,"local_amount":86.74,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832346},{"amount":180.89,"local_amount":178.31,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":180.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540840},{"amount":93.82,"local_amount":92.48,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":93.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516181},{"amount":604.32,"local_amount":595.7,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":604.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649765}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T22:02:07Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T12:10:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":680480,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia is 40 years old, married and lives with her family.

Latacunga in the province of Cotopaxi.  This canton is best known for its traditions, which include the very traditional Mama Negra, a state recognized cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nMilton's greatest challenge in life was not being able to finish his education, as he only finished elementary school.  His parents could not afford to educate Milton or his siblings so they started working in agriculture and raising animals (cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, etc.) from a very early age to help cover household expenses.  Therefore, with all the experience he has in his short life, Milton now buys and sells chickens and is a great moral and economic support to his family.  He has never given up despite the hardships he has had, and he is a determined young man, working four to five hours a day every day of the week.\r\n\r\nIt is becoming difficult for Milton to care for the animals because he does not have an adequate space to do this, so he is requesting a loan of $1,000 to build a pen so the animals do not get ill and are better cared for.  He will also buy chickens.\r\n\r\nMilton has been able to get ahead together with is family, his greatest pride.  Therefore, he is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making his personal and work growth possible.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1545483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She learnt this trade from experience because of the need to help her husband generate the necessary income for the household.

Her biggest challenge is the competition in her neighborhood, because it is a tradition that the people in the area use this kind of transportation to get around.\r\n\r\nThe loan she asks for will be used to buy a motorbike.

She is the mother of two children who live with her and their father. They both go to school. She and her spouse work the land, specifically, growing basic grains such as corn and beans, because the area is suitable for those types of crops. She has an incomplete primary school education because she couldn't keep going due to a lack of financial support from her parents. Her parents were the ones who taught her to work the land. They were farmers by tradition and the land they worked was theirs and is located by her house. She has a lot of experience working the fields and has been with her spouse for more than 10 years and with his she has done these activities. Her customers are the people from her community, friends, relatives, neighbors and more who come to the area seeking grains. \r\n\r\nShe needs to be bale to expand her corn and bean crops so today she is asking for help with KIVA funds to buy certified corn and bean seeds and agricultural materials. These will help her grow and fortify her crops and avoid damage from pests and animals. Her plans for the future are to extend her crops and buy more land to plant a wider variety, to buy animals to transport the seed in packs to other areas and be able to generate more income and seek other markets. Her dream as a mother is to be able to give her children a complete education so they can become better every day. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1545727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy certified corn seed and agricultural materials for help and maintenance.

When he was a child, he did not go to school. His parents could not send him to school because they did not have any money. However, a few years ago he started to take classes for adults where he learnt to read and write and he finished the 6th grade. He has a very big family: seven children and a wife. Most of his children are already married, some others live with him but already work, and the small ones go to school. His family is very close and hard-working.\r\n\r\nPedro has been working in agriculture for 15 years. He learnt this trade from his father and he does not have any other work. When sowing corn, he always has the help of his children who are in the area \u2013 since he has many children, he does not need paid help for the work.\r\n\r\nHe asks for a loan to buy study materials for his son who is at university, and to pay for the room where his son lives, so that he does not have to pay for transportation, which costs even more.\r\n\r\nIt is his dream that his son can achieve his goal, which is to have a professional career. Since Pedro did not have this opportunity, today his son can achieve this with the help from his brothers and from Pedro.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1545750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to buy study materials for his son who is at university, and to pay for the room where his son lives, so that he does not have to pay for transportation, which costs even more.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-03-09T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-08T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":73.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":86.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":88.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":92.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.62},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.39},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.08,"local_amount":72.08,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":72.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903229},{"amount":69.13,"local_amount":69.13,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216405},{"amount":170.57,"local_amount":170.57,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":170.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817773},{"amount":64.77,"local_amount":64.77,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":64.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526269},{"amount":82.01,"local_amount":82.01,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":82.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008714},{"amount":84.72,"local_amount":84.72,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500777},{"amount":82.95,"local_amount":82.95,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":82.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544433},{"amount":173.77,"local_amount":173.77,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":173.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595144840}],"funded_date":"2014-03-10T23:34:06Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Vaethjunker","image":null}},{"id":680589,"name":"Gelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Gelita.

His children have already started their own families and Kobul already has several grandchildren. As Kobul was unable to provide an education for his children, he really wants his grandchildren to be able to study in good educational institutions. In order to achieve this goal, Kobul works his fingers to the bone. <br \/><br \/>Kobul has undertaken fattening up cattle for resale for several years now. It is his only income presently. But he really likes his business as it brings in good revenue. He is saving money for his grandchildren's education little by little. Now Kobul wants to increase the size of his herd. On the advice of his friends, he decided to turn to the Arvand organization for financial assistance. With the received loan, Kobul will buy several cattle and expand his business.

This is why about 1 year ago she started to sell products from catalogs as an alternative to generate income that would allow her to contribute to her household\u2019s economy. Her family is very low income and sometimes they go without necessities for lack of funds.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she is requesting, she will buy stock such as t-shirts, jeans, blouses and other items. She will also include new products so she can offer more variety to her clients, who are mainly family members, friends, and neighbors. In this way, she will improve her income through her sales.\r\n\r\nCindy explains that her greatest wish is to have her own store where she can offer a great variety of products and thereby improve her family\u2019s income and improve their quality of life.

Like the majority of the village residents, the traditional source of income for her family is animal breeding and crop farming. To satisfy the needs of her large family regarding education, food, and expenses on clothing and transportation, it is necessary to receive the maximum profit on the smallest plot of land possible. As Kutfi never obtained a higher education herself, she dreams that her children will be able to get a good education and have good careers in the future.

He has few economic resources and did not go to school. Of 14 children, he was one of the oldest, and he had to help his parents with their work because the family was very poor. He lives with his wife and she works with him in the field. They have only two children, who are 8 and 5 years old and depend on him.\r\n\r\nWill currently grows corn and he has done this since he was a child. His father showed him this work and in those times, they did not have any other way to survive but farming. As a child, he also worked in the tobacco factories with his father. Today, in addition to farming, he works as hired help in the sugar cane fields, by which he earns some extra money. He gets up at 5:00 a.m. and travels to the field where he grows the corn. He travels this distance of roughly 3 kilometers by bike. He does not have a fixed time when he stops work, because he always finishes what he has planned to do for the day before he returns home and helps his wife with the daily tasks.\r\n\r\nHe asks for a loan which he wants to use to plant 7,000 square meters of corn, because at the moment they start to prepare the fields where he works for sowing, and also he wants to buy a plot.\r\n\r\nIt is Will\u2019s future dream to have a better house than he has now, and to be able to let his children have the education he could not have, because today a person who has a good academic education can get a good job. Also, he would like to have a car and thus to be able to make trips with his wife and children. He knows that the loan is a compromise, but he also knows that only in this way he will be able to fulfill his dreams, trusting in God. It will be a major effort, but by this he will be able to improve his economic situation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1545755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to sow 7,000 square meters of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-03-09T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-08T16:20:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Will Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420878}],"funded_date":"2014-03-10T02:53:10Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Vaethjunker","image":null}},{"id":680602,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":169.73,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase more cooking oil, rice and cooking seasonings for resale.

Mirian and her partner work together in agriculture to support their family.

The loan will be used to plant 16 hectares of corn, and will be spent on preparing the earth, buying seeds to plant, and buying manure and other fertilizers to care for the crop.  Her dream is to improve her quality of life and be able to raise her three children.  She would have liked to continue studying and have a university degree.

She wants to use the credit to buy a granary to keep the basic grains (corn and beans) which they grow.\r\n\r\nIn the future, they hope to improve all areas of their work: Erika Maritza\u2019s clothing sales as well as her partner Osmar\u2019s cops. This will enable them to get ahead, to have their daily food and to improve their lives. Both dream of having their own home which will help them to have the safety and comfort they need.

All of the financial institutions rejected her loan requests because of her unstable financial condition and lack of experience.  Her request was approved under the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nA loan of 3,000 GEL will help Ketevan to purchase goods.

She lives with her husband in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. She is the mother of one daughter and four sons. She does embroidery work by hand at her home and she financially supports her family. She belongs to a poor family.  Her husband\u2019s income is very poor so she decided to start embroidery work at home. She learned this art from her childhood and now she has adopted it for her occupation.  She has enabled herself to be independent and earn a sufficient income. She requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase stock of threads, silk, fancy sequins and pearls of various colours. She hopes that this loan will prove beneficial for her and for her family.

She shared this secret with a friend, who recommended the Instituto Campo Alto for its good performance and learning, which focuses more on teaching the whole person than the professional.  Yurleni liked the idea of attending this institution, which she knows will give her many employment opportunities that will help her to raise her younger siblings.  Ingrid knows that she cannot count on her mother for help, because she has the responsibility of caring for her siblings.  Faced by this disconcerting situation, she began working to pay for her studies, and the materials and tools that are required in the profession.  She can count even less on her father for support, as he has never taken the trouble to find out whether his children needed anything or taken any responsibility for them. Ingrid has decided to graduate, with the certainty that she can show her family that when someone has a goal in life it can be achieved; the only thing necessary is to make the decision.  For this reason Ingrid is requesting a loan from Kiva, in order to study and to achieve her dream of being a cosmetologist.  She has been lucky to find instructors and educators with a great desire and ability to make the world better, and she would like to become one of these people.  On a personal level, she would like to be an example for her siblings, so that they realize that although they might not have much income, if someone wants to get ahead dreams can become reality.  Ingrid hopes to acquire knowledge in the working world, learning mutually from her co-workers and also on a personal level. She would like to help her siblings, and is thinking about helping them to study, so that they too can make their goals and dreams become reality.

district. Her husband works as a driver at a construction company and generates 400 GEL monthly. As it becomes harder to support their family on this income, Nana decided to start her own business. She sells men's and women's clothing and linens. She couldn't receive a loan from the local financial institutions because of their requirements to have business experience or stable revenue. She is taking this loan through the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The program allows the rural poor, like Nana, a chance to start or re-start a business. Nana requested a loan of 700 GEL to purchase products at wholesale prices and then resell them among her friends and villagers. This will give her a chance to earn income and become financially independent. Thanks to the Start Up program, Nana will be able to save some money and provide a better future for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1550255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is the mother of one son who helps around the house and in the field alongside his father. She is a homemaker and a farmer with a lot of experience in the fields, harvesting corn, beans, and sorghum. Her parents taught her from an early age, since the family\u2019s income depended on this business. She went to school for part of first grade, but couldn\u2019t finish due to a lack of financial support from her parents. She and her husband and her son go each day to their farm to weed it and maintain it so that it doesn\u2019t get full of weeds. It is located 100 meters from their house and they get there by walking. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from COMIXMUL in order to buy agricultural inputs such as certified corn and bean seeds, manure, and fertilizers that will protect her crops from insects and aid in their growth. Her dream is to give her son a good education and see him grow as a person and as a professional, since this is the least he deserves. Her goals are to provide excellent care to her crops of corn and beans so that she can have a good harvest, and to continue building, little by little, a future for her

She previously requested a loan from FODEMI, which she invested in the crop she had then. Now she is planning to plant a new crop, so she needs the loan to buy manure and seed potatoes. Though she has competition, things have been going very well for her due to her good interactions with the customers that buy her 100-pound sacks of potatoes.

She lives in Tulc\u00e1n and has three daughters. One of them is already married and has her own household, one is 19 years old and is at university, and one is a 17-year-old girl who is at school. The latter two live with her. \r\n\r\nElena plants potatoes. She already had an earlier loan with FODEMI which she used to buy seeds and manure for her crop.

Albert asks for a loan of 300,000 Armenian drams in order to buy kitchen furniture for his house and also to make a nice surprise for his wife. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1550298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy kitchen furniture for his house and also to make a nice surprise for his wife.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ijevan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2014-03-09T19:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-08T19:10:05Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.73,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20850},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22880},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23780},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23920},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":24360},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24930},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25090},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":26240},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":26680},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27290},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":27980}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.57,"local_amount":20924.2,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T15:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20942.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468016134},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":24449,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T09:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":24470.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479239382},{"amount":62.11,"local_amount":25702.7,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T17:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25725.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490935696},{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":25722.6,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T16:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25745.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504373400},{"amount":63.48,"local_amount":26266.4,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T15:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":26289.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517719700},{"amount":65.12,"local_amount":26946.8,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":26970.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530121861},{"amount":66.01,"local_amount":27313.1,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-18T10:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":27337.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542631800},{"amount":185.76,"local_amount":76867.3,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T14:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":76936.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561765756},{"amount":108.97,"local_amount":45807.9,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":45849.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.73,"payment_id":579721512}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T19:49:03Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:32:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Coberly","image":null}},{"id":680675,"name":"Lusine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lusine is 35 years old and she lives with her husband and school-aged son in Vanadzor city in the Lori region.

She mainly grows coffee, which is how she has provided for her 3 children who are 21, 12, and 4 years old. She has been in charge of her small, 7 hectare farm for 8 years. She has been improving it and has 2 hectares of coffee planted. Her farm is certified Fair Trade, UTZ and C.A.F.E. Practices. Her average coffee production during the past three years is 75 quintales [100-pound sacks] of parchment coffee [the dried green coffee bean still enclosed in its parchment skin]. The main challenge she confronts in coffee production is the existence of pests and diseases. She is sure she will keep these under control with an adequate fertilization plan. For this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy inputs and fertilizers that will allow her to provide adequate maintenance to her plants. Her goal is to continue improving her coffee farm under an integrated management plan that will allow her to continue gradually investing in the development and diversification of her farm. She is certain she will achieve this with good decision making and dedication to her work, so that she can continue providing for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1545882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy inputs and fertilizers for producing coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":295,"posted_date":"2014-03-09T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-08T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-28T10:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25174,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610682669}],"funded_date":"2014-03-10T19:47:46Z","paid_date":"2015-02-28T10:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":678298,"name":"Mar\u00eda Candelaria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 50 a\u00f1os de edad, es una persona que  estudio hasta sexto grado y es una persona casada, su esposo se dedica a la agricultura.

Don Juan, 43, and his wife, Sra. Hilaria, have been married for 20 years and have three children, all still living at home.  Don Juan started a doll-making business three years ago.  He says that he used to work for someone else, selling toys, but he got to know a distributor who offered to sell him equipment for making dolls and decided to set up his own business.  He is applying for a loan to buy the materials he needs--plastic, cloth, paint, etc.--to carry on the business.  He says that his only problem is a lack of money to invest in the business.

She is 37 years old and is married to Mario. They have been together for 15 years and they have three children who attend school. She sells clothing and shoes by catalog, a business she has had for six months. Previously, she sold cosmetics and says that business was going well but customers asked for other products, like clothes and shoes, so she decided to change products. This time, she is requesting to buy more shoes. Paty, as her friends call her, comments that she likes to socialize with people. Every afternoon, she goes to sell from house-to-house. She says she already has good customers because they come to her house asking for products. Her only difficulty is when her clients are behind in their payments but they end up paying eventually. Paty's goal is to be an entrepreneur with the Avon company, a huge network of people that have achieved more profits and a higher quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are Teresa, who sells cosmetics; Laura, Francisca, Basilia, and Rosa who will buy lambs; and Maria Albertha who will invest in her grocery store. The group \"Banco de Piedra\" [Stone Quarry] consists of 7 people located in a pleasant community in which people usually are dedicated to growing corn. The name of the group was chosen because they live in a community where there is a stone quarry which they use for constructing their homes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7025,"image":{"id":1545624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes and clothing to sell.
