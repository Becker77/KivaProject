This investment will join with the effort and hard work that Gustavo and his family give to his farm to achieve greater results, and in this way to improve his financial situation."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1545912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy supplies and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":295,"posted_date":"2014-03-09T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-08T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gustavo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":679698,"name":"Awa's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe de 6 femmes fait parti du banc villageois qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9e le 25 juin 2002, il regroupe des membres qui habitent le m\u00eame village et ceux des alentours.

He has always worked, since he was young, since his father passed away when he was still a boy. He is a widower, as his wife passed away about four years ago. He had two children with her, who do not live with him anymore. He lives alone in his house, making a living as a farmer. He has also done carpentry for more than 40 years. His father taught him the carpentry profession. \r\n\r\nHe works almost every day from 6:00 am to 3:00 pm, since he has to walk a bit to get to work - about five kilometers there and back. He needs the loan to buy wood, since he periodically does carpentry when he has an order, since people generally seek his services for the making of wagon wheels, which he makes for a good price and of high quality.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will improve his productive activities and his income will increase.

She is currently attending the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Juan Misael Saracho, working towards her degree in linguistics. She plans to graduate in September 2014 but without a loan from Vittana, she fears that she will need to defer her graduation. With the $875 loan, Mariela plans to pay her graduation fee. This fee is often more expensive than the semester's tuition and is a frequent impediment for graduating students in Tarija. With a degree in linguistics, she expects to earn $13 a day. Mariela's parents were never able to complete their primary education. For her family of eight, finances have always been tight. As the youngest of five, with three older siblings attending college already, Mariela is unsure how she will be able to finance her graduation on her own without the assistance of a Vittana Loan.

Among his siblings, he was the one who managed to go to school the longest (fourth grade).  Thanks to this young man's effort his family has improved their basic living conditions.  He's married and his wife's a homemaker.  They have two children for whom they strive every day.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in construction for four years.  He learned this trade thanks to his brother, who taught him.  He also works in agriculture, growing corn on 7,000 square meters.  Previously he worked on a pig farm.  Later he helped his brother do small construction until he became known as a bricklayer.  Today Gumercindo earns a better income thanks to this job.  He works from 7:30 a.m. until 4 p.m., Monday through Saturday.  His workplace is a block from his house.\r\n\r\nGumercindo's going to use the loan to buy two calves and make the most of what's left over from his corn crop.  He'll fatten and sell the livestock to get the best price and make a profit.  He wouldn't be able to make the investment right now if he didn't have the loan.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to build his own house and become independent, because his small family currently lives in his parents' house.  He knows he'll achieve this by working hard and saving the money to buy the materials.  He won't have to pay for labor because he's going to build it himself.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1545913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He has a small farm measuring 6.33 hectares, on which he lives with his wife and four-year-old son. For the past five years he has relied on coffee growing, which is his main economic activity. Timely maintenance of his coffee plantations and participation in the Fairtrade certification process have allowed him to reduce risks in this market.\r\n\r\nOver the past three years, Orlin has achieved an average yield of 4.2 tonnes of parchment coffee per hectare. His goal for the current crop cycle is to produce 5.5 tonnes of parchment coffee, his main challenge being to reduce the presence of blights and diseases that affect the coffee. He is therefore seeking funding to allow him to guarantee the application of inputs and fertilisers on time, and thus keep this risk under control.\r\n\r\nHe is confident that his determination and responsibility in his work and towards his family will help him to achieve his stated goal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1545914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to purchase farm inputs and fertilisers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":295,"posted_date":"2014-03-09T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-08T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":511.2,"local_amount":12780,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-28T10:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12868.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595291332},{"amount":288.8,"local_amount":7220,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-28T09:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":7270.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624365215}],"funded_date":"2014-04-08T18:38:28Z","paid_date":"2015-03-28T09:43:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dom Bennett","image":null}},{"id":680865,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita is a 47-year-old married woman, with five children; one child is currently in school.

He has been working at the business for over three years, and learned how to do his work thanks to his parents, who taught him this economic activity. He developed the business about two kilometers from his house, which is why he has to travel there every day from his house.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy more animals for butchering so he can sell their meat, since he needs financial support to obtain a better income from his business and improve his and his family\u00b4s quality of life in the future. He plans to build a new house, since the one they have is very deteriorated, is a bahareque (wattle and daub) house, and is not in very good condition. Some of its walls are cracked and in a very bad state. With the earnings that his business generates, he will continue helping his parents, since they are quite old and they need his help. They depend directly on him and his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1545943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy more animals for butchering so he can sell their meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-03-10T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-09T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":36.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.61,"local_amount":41.61,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":41.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467903394},{"amount":42.89,"local_amount":42.89,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":42.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216425},{"amount":55.69,"local_amount":55.69,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":55.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817796},{"amount":46.08,"local_amount":46.08,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243771},{"amount":47.54,"local_amount":47.54,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":47.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526289},{"amount":48.94,"local_amount":48.94,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":48.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008733},{"amount":62.58,"local_amount":62.58,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":62.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500795},{"amount":254.67,"local_amount":254.67,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":254.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419620}],"funded_date":"2014-03-14T15:08:07Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:28:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jamie Schau","image":1143325}},{"id":680831,"name":"Lola Marcela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lola dreams of becoming a doctor.

cuando trabajaba en una empresa de gas propano muy reconocida en el departamento antioque\u00f1o, pero, luego de varios a\u00f1os se le present\u00f3 la oportunidad de independizarse y fue entonces cuando alquil\u00f3 un local y compr\u00f3 pipetas con gas propano para distribuirlo entre los vecinos, amigos y los negocios de comidas de la regi\u00f3n, su actividad comenz\u00f3 a dar resultados y ha logrado generar los ingresos suficientes para solventar los gastos familiares durante los \u00faltimos 13 a\u00f1os que lleva funcionando su negocio.\nEl cr\u00e9dito que solicita lo utilizar\u00e1

natural, siendo los restaurantes y negocios de comidas los que conforman su principal clientela.\nHilario manifiesta que su mayor anhelo es tener un carro para transportar el producto, pues hoy en

As\u00ed podr\u00e1 mejorar las utilidades que percibe por su labor y estar\u00e1 en la capacidad de dar a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Hilario, 47, is a modest, thriving, and hardworking man.  He's married and has two children, whom he has supported and educated.\r\n\r\nHilario earns a living as an independent merchant.  His working life began when he was working in a very well-known propane gas company in the department of Antioquia.  After several years, however, he had the opportunity to work on his own, so he rented a space and bought propane tanks to distribute to neighbors, friends, and the food businesses in the region.  The business started to yield results and he has managed to earn enough income to pay his family expenses for the last 13 years during which he has had his business.\r\n\r\nHilario's requesting the loan to buy more gas tanks so he has enough to satisfy current demand.  There are areas where they still aren't able to install a natural gas supply.  Restaurants and food businesses are his main customers.\r\n\r\nHilario said his biggest desire is to have a car to transport his product.  Currently he makes deliveries on a motorcycle, which increases his expenses because he has to make more trips.  That way he'd be able to increase the profit he earns for his work and be in a position to give his family a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1545960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy gas tanks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Antonio de Prado","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-03-10T00:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-09T00:40:05Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilario De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74154},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76204},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78312},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80478},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82703},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84990},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87341},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89756},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92238},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94789},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97411},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100105},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102873},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105718},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108642},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111646},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114734},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117906}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.71},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.68,"local_amount":241364,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T10:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":247641.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245552},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":76247,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":78230.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856285},{"amount":42.28,"local_amount":84559,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86758.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282977},{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":88995,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":91309.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983357},{"amount":604.42,"local_amount":1208835,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1240276.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531790040}],"funded_date":"2014-04-08T23:45:40Z","paid_date":"2014-09-25T09:29:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":678359,"name":"Sandra Milena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sandra es una mujer joven, humilde y trabajadora que ha sido vendedora en varios almacenes de vestido, pero hace aproximadamente tres a\u00f1os estudi\u00f3 un curso de confecciones y compr\u00f3 un m\u00e1quina plana y una fileteadora, para empezar su negocio y solicit\u00f3 el cr\u00e9dito para utilizarlo en la compra de otra m\u00e1quina plana familiar y una fileteadora industrial, con lo que pretende ampliar su negocio y adecuar el local.

With a Vittana loan, Marcos plans on purchasing his much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Marcos feels he will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. With a degree in mechanics he expects to earn $10 a day. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Marcos' parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. With four older siblings Marcos is unsure how he will be able to afford his school costs on his own without the assistance of a Vittana Loan. Marcos' and his father's salary from their job as a mason is the family's primary source of income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1550692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for textbooks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":264,"posted_date":"2014-03-10T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-09T01:00:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcos Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":423,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":105.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.33,"local_amount":105.83,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-30T09:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":106.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504428207},{"amount":35.44,"local_amount":35.27,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-28T09:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":35.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517705923},{"amount":35.64,"local_amount":35.47,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":35.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530256456},{"amount":35.27,"local_amount":35.1,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":35.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":566901011},{"amount":35.25,"local_amount":35.08,"processed_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":566901153},{"amount":177.07,"local_amount":176.25,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-25T10:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":177.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":583421112}],"funded_date":"2014-03-15T01:45:41Z","paid_date":"2014-12-25T10:40:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":680967,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a 34-year-old married man from Gaza City.

Then she can start her new project which she hopes will generate enough income to provide her son with a better quality of life and an education. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Diana aims to devote herself fully to her independent business and spend more time with her family while generating resources to support her husband with the household finances and enjoy a better quality of life together with her loved ones."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1546006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy two overlock sewing machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-03-10T01:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-09T01:10:08Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.64,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107109},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110071},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113115},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116243},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119458},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122762},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126157},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129645},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133231},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136915},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140702},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144592}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.17,"local_amount":104334,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":107047.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227935},{"amount":55.04,"local_amount":110070,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T10:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":112932.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245556},{"amount":55.75,"local_amount":111503,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":114403.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856289},{"amount":0.86,"local_amount":1717,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1761.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504282980},{"amount":123.2,"local_amount":246409,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":252818.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983361},{"amount":126.94,"local_amount":253882,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":260485.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542541555},{"amount":179.94,"local_amount":386791,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":396851.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.45,"payment_id":595188333},{"amount":128.46,"local_amount":285294,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":292714.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.19,"payment_id":636622089}],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T13:48:24Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:30:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":680928,"name":"Pelusi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pelusi is a 29 year old, hard-working, single parent who lives in Kagadi, Uganda.

Daira is currently attending the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Juan Misael Saracho, working towards her degree in computer engineering. She plans on graduating in April 2014, but without a loan from Vittana, she thinks that she may need to take time off to work and save until she can return to school. Daira plans on using the funds from this loan to pay her graduation fee. This fee is often more expensive than the semester's tuition and is a frequent impediment for graduating students in Tarija.\r\n\r\nWith a degree in computer engineering, Daira expects to earn $30 a day. Daira hopes to be a role model for her younger brother by being the first in her family to graduate from university.

piglets grew healthy and fat. When the payment time came, she sold all of her pigs and earned a satisfactory profit. She was really happy with her results, because during the period, her piglets grew well without disease. Thus, she was able to sell them at a high price. The profit covered her daily needs, her children's school fees, and most importantly it provided capital for her business. She is very grateful to MUK, KIVA, and lenders for supporting her business. She said she will always need assistance from the loan officer of MUK for advice and other business solutions.\r\n\r\nNi Nengah wants to increase her business by keeping local pigs for a pig roast. She needs a new loan to purchase three local pigs and feed. She usually only keeps the pigs for the barbeque for two or three months and then she sells them. Her husband supports her business by helping her feed the pigs and clean the barn. Ni Nengah saves her profit, because she dreams to renovate her kitchen.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1551155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Since the household income is not sufficient to run the family, Levish wants to concentrate fully on her fish-selling business because fish is considered as a staple food in Manipur and the demand is very high throughout the year. There\u2019s a high chance of generating a good income. She thanks WSDS for being so considerate towards her and the group. The rest of the group members are engaged in chive cultivation.

The repayment is attended to by all members, but the boards are responsible for the process. Ni Komang, as the head of the group, is fully responsible for the group. Ni Komang is a housewife and raises pigs to support her economic life. At the last loan, she maintained two pigs. Ni Komang is really grateful because the pigs can grow well and healthy. She sold the pigs at a price of 3.6 million IDR. After deducting all the costs, she earned a profit of about 2.5 million IDR. She used the profits to develop her business, for saving and daily life. She said thanks to all the lenders, Kiva and MUK for supporting her business. \r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in the previous period, the Mekar Sandat group proceeds to the next loan. Based on the assessment of MUK, they still receive the same loan size - currently 15,000,000 IDR for group lending, and 1 million IDR to 1.3 million IDR for each individual person. Because most have been able to increase their numbers of pig populations, the current loan will be used to buy food and fix the cages. Ni Komang will use this loan to buy super-quality feed and build new cages. She is very pleased with the effort that can be developed. She hopes to become a big pig seller in her village and for all the profits to improve the welfare of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1551172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy super-quality feed and build new cages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-03-10T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-09T06:10:01Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luhi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":15000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1325,"local_amount":15000000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":15139317.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542554813}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T18:20:27Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:08:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Lush","image":null}},{"id":681024,"name":"Paulina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulina works hard to support her family.

He is married and has one child. He has been doing farming for three years where his income source comes from milk, eggs, tea and transportation services. In farming, he enjoys dairy farming the most, but his biggest challenge is that animal feed is very expensive.<br \/><br \/>Cornellius chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they finance agricultural assets.

","en":"Hello! Her name is Mayra Milena. She was born in Bogot\u00e1, on the 3rd of September. She has always lived together with her large family, parents and siblings. When she was five, she started school with great expectations and the will to be the best. She finished her basic studies when she was sixteen. It was difficult for her to continue studying, so she decided to start working. Already as an underage, she started working at a shoe store, a call center, supermarkets and other places. When she became an adult, her first formal job was at an important clothes store. After a year, she got a job as an auditor, since she had taken some English courses with the National Education Institution (SENA) and had started to study Computer Engineering. She studied there for four semesters and received a diploma as a Computer Technician.\r\n\r\nShe changed job and started working for a company that imported dental products. She worked as a receptionist at the beginning, but the company gave her the opportunity to grow professionally, so she became the coordinator of the customer service and warranty department, where she worked for four years. Because of her good performance, the company helped her to continue with her studies, so she decided to study Industrial Engineering. She is in the first semester, but had to postpone her studies because she received the best present of all from God: a baby.\r\n\r\nShe is currently living with her husband, who was her boyfriend for more than six years, and her son Samuel Camilo, who is two years old. She has been working as an administrative assistant for a year. Her goals in life continue to be the same but are clearer now that she has a son and a family that encourage her to be better every day and give her best in each activity.\r\n\r\nShe admires from his son the innocence with which he sees life, how sweet he is, but most of all how much love and strength he gives her to achieve all of her goals. She likes everything related to the healthcare sector, but most of all working with administrative tasks, since she is more visible to others and can help them. She also enjoys helping patients to get a better and quicker service. Now that she has been working as an administrative assistant for this healthcare center, she has regained the motivation to continue with her studies and get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe needs the help from Kiva because she does not have what she needs to pay the university fees. The home expenses are high, but with this support she will be able to cover them more easily."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1546913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester's fee at the university.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-10T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-09T13:30:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Milena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":153531.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882873},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":153531.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202238},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":153531.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286379},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":153531.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225086}],"funded_date":"2014-03-10T14:31:52Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":681086,"name":"Celzo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celzo is a very patient and loving father of six who is married. \r\n\r\nCelzo has managed a store for eight years.

They sell food ingredients (tomatoes, chillies, aubergines and cabbage), potatoes, cosmetic products, clothing and firewood.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase their working capital, the women have decided to work with the field partner, Soro Yiriwaso, this will be their first group loan.\r\n\r\nTenin (sitting on the far right of the photo) is well-known for selling food ingredients (tomatoes, chillies, aubergines and cabbage).  She plans to use her loan to buy a basket of tomatoes, a basket of chillies, one sack of aubergines and one sack of cabbages from the market in Bamako.

The paste is left to get harder in molds designed for this purpose. Then it is cut into pieces ready to be sold.\r\n\r\nThe soaps are sold at the market and door-to-door, to a mixed-gender clientele.

As part of this, he is currently requesting a loan to build a camp on his farm so that his workers will have the necessary living condition during the coffee cutting period.

She links traditional Iraqi rug weaving with modern fashionable rugs, preserving traditional Iraqi rug weaving techniques and protecting them from extinction.\nTraditional Iraqi handmade rugs hold a special place in the hearts of Iraqis, with every family, regardless of income level, having a traditional rug in their home. Ayar\u2019s rugs are woven with love; love for her art, love for her heritage, and love for Iraq\u2019s culture.\nAyar, a 53 year old mother of three, owns a small hand-woven rug workshop. In addition to supporting her own family, she employs four other women, thereby enabling them to support their families. \nTo expand her business, Ayar is taking an SME loan in the amount of 10,000 USD. She will use this loan to move production to a larger workshop where she can increase the number of rugs produced and where she can have a showroom to display her rugs, thereby increasing sales. She plans to hire more women to work with her and will provide them with training in this traditional art-form.\nAyar describes her business with her own words in the video: \u201cI\u2019m Ayar, from Iraq, the owner of this handmade rug weaving business, which is one of the most Iraqi traditional works\/arts. I received a 10,000 USD loan from Relief International to improve my business; I will rent a larger workshop where I can have a large fixed showroom. Thank you\u201d. \n\nNote: The disbursal date for this loan is actually January 15, 2014, not January 29, 2014 as listed on this loan profile. Relief International initially tried to upload this loan to Kiva's system on February 14, however given the large file size of the video, it was not successfully completed within the 30 days Kiva typically allows for posting a loan to Kiva after the disbursal date. Because of the limitations of our system, and the technical issue that resulted in this loan not being uploaded as intended, Kiva has allowed Relief International to re-post this loan with another disbursal date. Lenders can still expect to receive repayments according to the noted repayment schedule for this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1546745,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2937,"youtubeId":null,"title":null,"thumbnailImageId":1551625},"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["SME","Growing

His plantation is twenty-eight hectares, twelve of which are for growing coffee. In recent years, he has managed a harvest of approximately 50,000 pounds of parchment coffee, which he produces in accordance with several certification processes: Fair Trade, UTZ, and Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices. On average, this small farmer generates four jobs in the community throughout the year; during the harvest season, he generates around twenty jobs. As part of the improvements that this farmer has been implementing in his plantation in terms of working conditions and occupational safety, Eduardo is currently applying for a loan to build a camp for his workers. This will allow his workers to have the necessary conditions to live at the plantation during the harvest season. This will contribute to a better output on the part of his workers and, therefore, a greater productivity. In addition, it is aligned with the self-regulated corporate social responsibility that the Association for People in Community Action (PAC) promote among its members. Similarly to this investment application, Eduardo also has applied for a loan to maintain his coffee production in its current phase.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1604.46,"image":{"id":1547921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Fair Trade"],"use":"to build a camp for his workers.

This is his story: \n\u201cMy name is Benjamin and am currently the Chief Operations Officer of Juhudi Kilimo, an Agricultural Microfinance Institution in Kenya. I am requesting a Kiva loan to enable me pursue my MBA studies. This course will equip me with the knowledge and practical managerial approach that I can put into action and positively impact the organization. This will allow me to  have a greater impact on our farmers and transform their livelihoods and that of the communities we work in. This promise I hope to deliver.\nI grew through the ranks to where I am now through hard work and by being passionate about small scale farmers and serving them diligently. I started as a Credit officer, then senior officer and Regional manager before getting the opportunity to head the operations at Juhudi. \nJuhudi Kilimo gives me great satisfaction, and I have never been as happy as now because every day I get to see the impact our loans have in transforming our farmers lives. \nAfter high school I engaged in small businesses like selling vegetables, mending shoes and other menial jobs to raise enough capital to start a barbers shop. My parents didn't have the means to send me to college so I used the income from my barbers shop to join my Diploma course. This certificate helped me get my first Job in Microfinance. I have since completed my Bachelors Degree in business administration, albeit with struggle as I still support my other siblings and aging parents.\nBeing the head of operations I am charged with the greater responsibility of ensuring business growth quality service to our farmers.There is need for me to upgrade my skills in leadership, operations and strategic management so as to be more effective in driving Juhudi strategy to reach 160,000 farmers with life transforming loans by 2016. This promise I will deliver to our farmers , and continue to transform their lives with your support.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9850,"image":{"id":1548650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Astghik milk cows and uses the milk in cheese production, which her husband sells in nearby markets. \r\n\r\nAstghik requested a loan, which she will use to purchase three more calves and forage for feeding them. As this is Astghik's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who did not have access to credit products in the past because they have no credit history. She will be very grateful if lenders support her farm and give her an opportunity to enlarge agricultural turnover.

Algo muy caracter\u00edstico de la comunidad donde se ubica el grupo es su pastizal muy verde y los hermosos paisajes de cerros muy frondosos.

All of them are hardworking and possess the drive to succeed in their businesses and to help their families get ahead.  They have known each other for several years and over time they have established a great and sincere friendship.  <br \/><br \/>These women live in a Mazahua community where some of the people communicate in their indigenous language.  A few of the women still wear traditional garments that stand out because of their bright colors.  Other things that their community is known for are the green pastures and lush vegetation that exist against a backdrop of beautiful rolling hills.  <br \/><br \/>Adriana, age 27, is a member of this group.  She only has a high school education and is always known for being cheerful and in very good humor.  Adriana and her husband \u00c1ngel are in a common-law relationship.  He works as a bricklayer and the two of them have formed a family that has five children, two of whom are in school.  <br \/><br \/>Adriana has managed a grocery store for the past five years.  This time she is requesting a loan in order to buy more grocery products such as bread, eggs, milk, soft drinks, canned goods, and other items.  She says that she opened her grocery store because there were no other places to buy products in the area where she lives.  Thanks to the loans, Adriana says that she has been able to maintain her grocery store and acquire a little bit of everything so that she can keep her customers happy with her service.  <br \/><br \/>Adriana\u2019s business is doing very well.  Every day she is able to generate a good amount of revenue from her sales.  Her only challenge she faces now is the competition from other stores nearby.  However, she is not discouraged by this situation.  On the contrary, she wakes up early every day so that she can begin working.  Adriana hopes that her revenues don\u2019t decline because her only ambition in life is to have a larger shop and convert it into a variety store.  <br \/><br \/>Adriana says, \u201cMy greatest wish is to help my children with their studies since I was not able to continue my education.\u201d  The members of this group are grateful because the loan will keep their businesses going and allow them to expand, as well as increase their profits.  Do\u00f1a Irma, Mar\u00eda Elsa, Ver\u00f3nica, and Mar\u00eda Juana will invest in their grocery stores.  Rosario and Ma Rosario will invest in clothing.

She takes these products to sell at the Bilwi-Puerto Cabezas municipal market.  She delivers them to customers who already know her and place orders with her.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that she is requesting a loan.  She does so in order to increase the production of cheese and cream.  She will buy more milk.  She also needs to buy molds to make cheese, a tub, and a table to shape the cheese.  She also wants to diversify her business activity by purchasing pigs to fatten and latter sell at the market.  She wants to do this because there is a good demand for pork.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of seeing her business become bigger and with better conditions.  She also want to come to have a grocery store in which she is able to sell the main products that the population demands.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1548190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more milk, cheese molds, a tub, a table for molding cheese, and pigs to fatten and sell at the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Puerto Cabezas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":328,"posted_date":"2014-03-10T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-09T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Nubia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200.81,"local_amount":5073.11,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T19:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5175.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479252888},{"amount":37.53,"local_amount":948.08,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":967.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519666358},{"amount":67.21,"local_amount":1697.96,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1732.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530166356},{"amount":81.99,"local_amount":2071.35,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-18T10:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2113.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579738047},{"amount":87.46,"local_amount":2209.5,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2254.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611947732}],"funded_date":"2014-03-10T23:07:43Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T13:28:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":681165,"name":"Samah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samah is a 28-year-old divorced Palestinian refugee.
