She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her General Store, Rice Dealer and Hog raising businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.

Her previous loan of PHP 27,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

Her husband helps in running the business and they have six children aged between twenty-five years old and twelve years old. Her business is located at a busy market in Kakamega. Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane and it is known as the sugar belt region.\r\n\r\nShe makes and sells steel doors, windows and gates. She has been in this business for five years now and has two employees. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is scarcity of materials for making the items that she sells. She also admits that being a woman, she has to work extra hard to convince the local people that she can do exellent work for them just like men. This is because this kind of business is male dominated. She works very hard to keep her business doing well.

In particular, they have a dairy farm with 8 milk cows. The family members produce and sell, on average, 150 kg of cheese locally. They have a lot of experience in cheese production and their cheese is of a high quality. Also, Yuri grows potatoes, haricots and onions on a family-owned plot of land. Vegetables are sold locally to the greengrocery wholesalers. Total average income of the family is 650 GEL per month, including the pension of Yuri\u2019s mother. \r\n\r\nYuri requested credit to purchase hay for feeding the cows during the winter period. Also, approximately 30% of the credit will be used for expansion of the cattle shed. In the near future, Yuri plans to increase the amount of cows on the farm, but the existing cattle shed doesn\u2019t allow him to keep more than 8 cows. After expansion of the cattle shed he will be able to realize his business idea, which will be followed by the increase of the family income, as well as improving their living conditions.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":864383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase feed for cows and construction materials for expansion of the cattle shed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kharjami","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2011-09-09T13:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":182.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":302.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244612798},{"amount":1642.5,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2720.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250828047}],"funded_date":"2011-09-25T23:57:25Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:42:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":337580,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magdalena is 42 years old and lives in the Philippines.

F. lives in the Khuroson region.

Her business furnishes the local markets with fresh poultry and eggs. She has been in this business for the past 3 years. The business is profitable, but the income is insufficient to afford rebuilding the chicken house, which she needs to do in order to be able to work in better conditions and take better care of the poultry.

It is also my desire to purchase two display counters and fill them with products so that my store can have all that is necessary for everyday needs. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Helen Smith, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTengo una tienda, donde llevo 5 a\u00f1os de tenerla; me dedico a tiempo completo a poderla atender donde mis clientes buscan la calidad de mis productos.\r\nTengo 4 hijos de los cuales me ayudan para poder ir a comprar el producto y poder surtirlo.\r\nMi prop\u00f3sito es agrandar mi negocio y as\u00ed poder surtirlo.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For 13 years she has been doing two activities that are essential for the livelihood of her home. First she began to manufacture artisinal guitars. She also offers the service of shows on the weekend in which she is the lead singer. She delights her audience with her melodious voice singing various songs. She has to work all week since she builds guitars with her husband, and weekends she sings with her musical equipment.

This is the sixth loan opportunity she has had with MFP. For the entire time she has been with the communal bank she has been very punctual with her payments.

Competition among them is really difficult, especially in food and cosmetic sales, because every member expects good results from her daily sales.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to stock their stores, buy more products and offer better services to their customers so that they will have more income and a better economic situation in the future. \r\n\r\nAs this is a new group, they have received

He has two wives and is the father of five children. He lives in his own home in Sienso, in the San prefecture. He masters the cereals business, having learned it from his father some twenty years ago. He has his own business in Sienso. He is very much in demand at the weekly markets of the town of San and nearby areas. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of expanding his business, two years ago he decided to seek assistance from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso.

He buys his stock form wholesalers of Sienso, but with the increased working capital he plans to go directly to farmers to stock up. He sells in Sienso everyday,  next to the asphalted road, to a client base composed of women and men, on credit and for cash. He expects to achieve a monthly income of 40,000 West African Francs, which he plans to use for repaying the loan, with the rest used to cover school fees of his children and food. The rest will be reinvested in his business.

buying and selling rice grains; working as a rice retailer; and running a food vending business. She lives in E.B. Magalona, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005. She has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. \r\n<p>\r\nMary Grace is borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she can purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Mary Grace aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They will receive in-kind input loans from One Acre Fund to plant maize in 2012.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Maximillah and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nMaximillah takes care of six children at home with her husband.

Only the oldest attends school because the second-oldest is mute, and there are no schools for children with special needs in Namaacha.  Leopoldina and her family moved to Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland, in 1996 when her husband worked there as a border guard.  <P>\r\n\r\nLeopoldina studied through only 8th grade, and the sole way for her to earn a living was to enter the workforce.  Having worked as a barber in her youth, in 1998 she opened a hair salon in her home and was successful.  In 2006, however, her husband became sick, and she had to spend all their money to treat him.  He did not withstand the illness and lost his life in 2007.  After this tragedy, Leopoldina had no money to continue her business.  With three children to raise and six months pregnant, she counted on just her father\u2019s help.  Three months later she received an indemnity\/benefit payment for her husband\u2019s service.  For her children, she opted to leave the funds in the account for the length of the term because in addition to the original amount, she began to receive a monthly pension of 2,000 meticais (MTn).  With the help of Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner), Leopoldina transformed the old salon into a shop where she sells basic necessities.  She has had positive results and is able to raise her children and to save 2,000 MTn.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  She used the first loan of 15,000 MTn to buy products for her shop, and will use this second loan of 25,000 MTn to do the same.  In the future she intends to ask for more loans to invest in a chicken-selling business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

ventures:  fishing, fattening pigs and selling food. She lives in Prk. Tuboran, Brgy. Caghagan, Sipalay, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing, pig fattening and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Rosita is now borrowing 20,000 PHP so that she  can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 22,500 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Rosita hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.  <p>\r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

Four women are its members; they all know each other and are neighbors.  They are:  Mrs. Lorenza E. C. who will use the loan to buy rice by the kilogram, eggs, pork, sausages, vegetables, cream, cheese and corn to prepare her meals; Mrs. Marlen Catalina V. V\u00e1zquez who will buy women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes on order and to have stock available to offer her customers; Mrs. Agustina C. R. who will buy merchandise like cloth napkins and tablecloths and thread, needles, buttons, elastic, clasps, hooks, etc.; to stock her business, Mrs. Melba Garc\u00eda Q. will buy blouses, skirts, pants, sweaters and men\u2019s clothes like pants and shirts.\r\n\r\nMrs. Agustina C. R. is a group member.  She\u2019s 57 years old and finished sixth grade of elementary school.  She\u2019s married and her husband\u2019s a farmer; they have six children:  Porfirio, 42, Ezequiel, 40, Jes\u00fas, 38, H\u00e9ctor, 35, Germ\u00e1n, 32 and Luis, 30.  All the children are married and work.  \r\n\r\nShe has a business selling notions, toys and women\u2019s articles like perfume, cosmetics and accessories.  She requested her loan to buy merchandise.  She will buy thread, needles, yarn, hoops, napkins and tablecloths to embroider and toys.  Her usual customers are young girls and women.  She offers them notions like napkins to embroider, thread, yarn, embroidery hoops, cosmetics, perfumes, toys and accessories for young girls and young ladies like hairpins, brackets, pendants, etc.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business 20 years ago needing to support her children.  She taught herself how to go to Mexico City on her own to get her merchandise.  She started out with just a few items.  She wouldn\u2019t spend anything but rather would reinvest all her profits back into the business.  She gradually grew and now she earns profits.\r\n\r\nShe went to work in the United States for two and a half years and saved up.  When she returned she built her business\u2019 booth so now is able to leave her merchandise there because before she had to take it back and forth from home.  She was also able to vary her merchandise and her business grew still more.  The space where she has her booth is borrowed and is in the town of Moyotepec a block and a half from home; she can walk to it.\r\n\r\nHer business is important because it helps her survive, it helps her fill her time and it amuses her while helping her.  When she\u2019s at work she is also working making felt arrangements that a friend is teaching her how to make.  She is proud of her business.  Thanks to God and the effort she\u2019s put into it she is proud to have this kind of business.\r\n\r\nHer husband helps her take care of customers and to set up the booth.  Her business is popular because of its location in the market and several people come by to buy.  The challenges she faces are the high costs because if the price of her products rises she has to raise her prices too.  Her business faces competition from another similar one in the market.\r\n\r\nShe uses profits from the business to cover needs like gas, light and sometimes the telephone and to reinvest.  What she likes are the profits; she has a separate investment already.\r\n\r\nAgustina is very happy with this loan because it allows her to stock her business, to become fulfilled and to enlarge it so that it will look prettier.  This business has helped her economically quite a bit.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019d like to make some home improvements like enlarge some of the bedrooms so that when her children visit with their families they\u2019ll have somewhere to stay.  Her plans and hopes are to continue progressing in her business and continue to save for when she is unable to work any longer.

Most of the people who live there earn their living making sweets that are typical of the region. To make them, they use amaranth, peanuts, seeds and tamarind, among other ingredients.\r\n\r\nThere are also sweets called obleas. Obleas are typical Mexican sweets consisting of two wafers with a dulce de leche filling. They often include condensed milk, pieces of chocolate, grated coconut, blackberry filling, cheese or jam. The wafers are usually made from wheat flour and measure approximately 20 centimeters across and 1 millimeter in thickness. Obleas originated in Huazulco since the inhabitants there were the first people to make these sweets. Obleas are exported to other places.\r\n\r\nLilia is one of the members of this group. She has a store where she makes and sells obleas. She is a very responsible, hardworking person. Lilia would like to invest in her store in order to improve it as well as her family's quality of life.

trabajadora. \nDesde hace 8 a\u00f1os Bridie vendia productos naturales para una empresa importante, pero su \u00edmpetu emprendedor y deseo de ser independiente, primaron ante la alternativa de seguir siendo empleada o empresaria de su propia microempresa. Ella decidi\u00f3 emprender su aventura de negocio y tom\u00f3 toda la experiencia de su antiguo trabajo y la tradujo en un negocio de venta de productos naturales en  punto comercial llamado \u201cTienda naturista Sol de Vida\u201d. Con un ahorro que habia logrado, hizo su primera inversi\u00f3n y hasta la presente le ha ido muy bien, por eso esta entusiasmada y quiere fortalecerlo, hasta lograr un crecimiento que le ayude a aumentar sus ingresos y con ello incrementar el bienestar de su hijo hasta llevarlo a que obtenga estudios superiores y potencialice su \u00e9xito en la vida.

Su mayor desafio es el capital de trabajo pues no es suficiente en la medida en que se incrementan las ventas y requiere tener un efectivo disponible para surtir especialmente con los puctos que mas rotan.  Mientras Bridie construye su sue\u00f1o a fuerza de trabajo y disciplina, continua esmerandose por sostener una rentabilidad sobre sus ventas no menor del 38% una rentabilidad sobre la inversi\u00f2n no menor de un 33%, para lograr su sostenibilidad.\n","en":"Bridie is 44 years old and lives with her son in Calle Real, a neighborhood which is located in the city of Cartagena de Indias, a beautiful and colonial city on the shores of the Caribbean sea which is frequently visited by both domestic and international tourists who admire its warm scenery and its kind and hard-working people.\r\n\r\nFor eight years, Bridie sold natural products for a well-known company.  However, her entrepreneurial spirit and her desire to be her own boss prevailed over the alternative of continuing to work as an employee and she now works as a businesswoman in charge of her own microbusiness.  Bridie decided to undertake her own business venture.  She took advantage of all the experience she gained in her old job and started her own business selling natural products from a commercial sales location called \"Tienda Naturista Sol de Vida\".  With some savings that she had made, she made her first investment and, up to now, her business has done very well.  For this reason, she is enthusiastic and would like to strengthen her business and achieve a level of growth that will help her to increase her income and, thereby, improve the well-being of her son so that he can pursue a higher education and be successful in life.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Bridie's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy natural products such as green tea, bees' honey, fat burners, natural laxatives, etc.  Her biggest challenge is working capital as she does not have enough.  As she increases her sales, she needs to have cash available to stock her business, especially with the products that have the quickest turnover.\r\n\r\nWhile Bridie builds her dreams through her hard work and discipline, she continues to take care to maintain a profitability on her sales of no less than 38% and a profitability on her investment of no less than 33%, in order to achieve

This is the 6th time she has taken out a loan with MFP and is very happy to be one of the members who has a clean track record in handling loans and has proven to be punctual with her repayments.This time she will use the loan to buy products and ingredients to continue making her cakes of different flavours and textures.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":864482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products and consumables to make cakes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":436.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":469.74},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":487.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":512.82},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":535.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":557.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.98},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.98,"local_amount":436.32,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":436.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851268},{"amount":172.24,"local_amount":469.74,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":469.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666450},{"amount":178.82,"local_amount":487.68,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":487.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621603},{"amount":188.03,"local_amount":512.82,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":512.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835685},{"amount":196.5,"local_amount":535.9,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":536.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245457},{"amount":204.43,"local_amount":557.54,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":557.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385507}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T04:40:20Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":337612,"name":"Enkhtsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Enkhtsetseg, 46, runs a grocery store selling basic food commodities.

help with the home expenses of her family. She thought that this activity was very practical because by doing it, she does not neglect her home and could take care of her sons. Years before she sold jewelry, but she left this business because she had to travel a lot to Guadalajara, Jalisco which is about 10 hours to Monterrey by bus and this was so difficult for her. Also she spent money in travel expenses so it was not advantageous. As she had a portfolio of clients already, she decided to find something different with demand and available to purchase in her city as well, so Maria de Jesus found her actual business of selling shoes and plastic articles by catalogue. She needs a loan for $850 and is asking for 6 months to repay the loan, because this time her shoe sales will increase for school season and for this reason she needs to invest in merchandise. She comments that this business makes her feel free and independent because her earnings are good and it is not necessary to request money from her husband for her basic expenses (and two of her three sons are in the university). She works for awhile every afternoon and every weekend she dedicates more time. She feels very happy with her achievements and Maria de Jesus does not discard the possibility of one day getting to have her own center of distribution.<\/p><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>SPANISH<\/p><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>Hace 2 a\u00f1os Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, decidi\u00f3 ponerse a vender calzado para ayudar con los gastos del hogar, consideraba que era una actividad muy pr\u00e1ctica, ya que con ella no descuidar\u00eda su casa y el cuidado de sus hijos. Antes vend\u00eda joyer\u00eda, pero dejo este negocio porque ten\u00eda que viajar a la ciudad de Guadalajara, Jalisco a m\u00e1s de 10 horas de distancia para traer la mercanc\u00eda, y esto se le dificultaba mucho, adem\u00e1s de tener que invertir en los gastos de viaje, y ya no le resultaba tan ventajoso. Como ya contaba con una cartera de clientes, decidi\u00f3 buscar algo que tambi\u00e9n tuviese demanda, pero que pudiese comprar en la misma ciudad, fue as\u00ed como dio con la venta de calzado y vasijas de pl\u00e1stico, las cuales vende por cat\u00e1logo y surte el pedido conforme lo demandan sus clientes. Esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo de $9,000 a 6 meses, pues en calzado se le han incrementado las ventas con motivo del regreso a clases de los ni\u00f1os, por lo que necesita invertir en mercanc\u00eda. Ella comenta que gracias al negocio, se siente independiente, pues las ganancias son buenas y no necesita estar pidiendo dinero a su esposo para cubrir sus gastos m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos. Ya que 2 de sus 3 hijos est\u00e1n estudiando en la universidad. Su negocio lo atiende un rato por las tardes y los fines de semana, que es cuando le dedica mayor tiempo.

For the last year, she has raised chickens in a small corral built on her aunt's property. Manuela also teaches at an educational center in her neighborhood. She closely monitors the growth and development of her chickens, as that is directly tied into the price for which she can sell them. Once they reach the desired size and weight, she kills and cleans them, and prepares them so they are ready for the grill. Her business is successful due to the fact that the chickens reach the desired size and weight in 40 days. This is her second loan from MFP, and she enjoys working with her community bank because all of its associates are responsible and there are never any problems regarding re-payment schedules.

She began her business in 2000 and operates it out of a stall in Narantuul, Ulaanbaatar\u2019s largest outdoor market. \r\n<p>\r\nOver the past nine years, E. has proven to be a very hard-working entrepreneur with a lot of business and customer service experience. Currently, her working capital exceeds 2 million tugrugs (and she operates with a profit margin of 30%).  She hopes that when the time comes, she and her husband will be able to afford to send all of their children to university, where they can learn how to improve their own lives and the lives of others. E. is requesting a 1,500,000 tugrug (approx. $1013 USD) loan in order to purchase more clothing for her business and to increase her working capital.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans.

With continued profits, Eladia hopes to purchase a small truck so that she can buy her merchandise more easily and in greater quantities. She also hopes to support her children\u2019s education with the benefits from her business, making sure that they receive the best schooling possible. In the future, Eladia hopes to purchase her own store and continue increasing the size of her sales and customer base.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Thank you for lending to Eladia and the Mujeres Unidas con Propositos group!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":491231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Sinavaiui has 2 years of experience in this business.  Sinavaiui needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 tala or US $108 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sinavaiui joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sinavaiui's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sinavaiui S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is married and is the father of 4 children.  The two oldest are 14 year old twins, and the other children are 12 and 3 years of age.  Three of them attend school.  Milion studied through the 12th grade, but did not continue due to a lack of resources.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports his mother by sending her money to use for household expenses.\r\n\r\nMilion left Lichinga for Maputo with his brother in order to continue his studies.  He has worked as an advisor and a data manager for Doctors of the World [M\u00e9dicos do Mundo\/M\u00e9dicins du Monde, a non-governmental organization] for over 8 years.  He makes 17,500 MZN per month--equivalent to $700 USD--, which he uses to pay for household expenses and his own work.  He saves some in his bank account, although he is not always able to because he has to pay for his wife's college expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is Milion's third loan with Hluvuku and first with Kiva.  It has a value of 15,000 MZN, which he will use to legalize the land attached to his other property.  The previous loans, both for 15,000 MZN, were used to buy construction material for the work.  He is sure that he will be able to pay back the loan without any problems and ask for another one in order to erect a house on the land to be legalized.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She alone takes care of her young son Fabricio, who is 7 years old. She home schools him in her parents' house, located in the locality of Santa Ana. She lives with her 2 younger sisters. She makes various types of breads and biscuits, her specialty. She has been a baker for 10 years and she learned the trade from her father, and to date they work together. She states that following her business success she has been able to expand it even more, adding the sale of butter, cheese, and sausages, to be enjoyed with any type of bread. And given these additions her sales have increased. Throughout all this time she has been able to cover the household expenses, as well as her son's and her own education. In her quest for progress, she is learning to be a primary school teacher at an institution in her locality, and she is almost finished. What she most enjoys about her work is delivering breads and decorating cakes for special occasions. She also likes the Christmas season when she bakes turkeys. In the future she's thinking about studying to be a chocolatier and a pastry chef to improve her cakes and snacks. This will help her sales be more constant and secure. She is a member of the communal bank \"Mi Banquito\", meaning \"My Little Bank\" and this is her ninth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She is very happy and enthusiastic about continuing her active involved in her communal bank. She also promises to be punctual with her loan payments.

She is a seamstress, but she only sews clothes for children and underwear depending on orders.  Additionally, she sells bananas and charcoal out of her house.  She has been carrying out both activities for 8 years with the unconditional support of her children.  She enjoys her work because she is able to stay busy and leave her worries on the side.  Additionally, it is profitable because she is located in a good location.  In the future she would like to increase her sales of bananas in bunches at wholesale, since bananas are very profitable.  This is her first loan through MFP and she is very happy because it will give her the opportunity to continue growing her business.  With the money from the loan she will use 700 soles to purchase more bananas and charcoal.

She lives in Purok 2, Brgy. Linaon, Cauayan , Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1995 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average income of PHP10,000.  \r\n\r\nHelen is now borrowing PHP 18,500 for the renovation of her pump boat.  This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Helen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Despite having difficulty maintaining her business because she cannot reinvest her profits into it since it is also the main source of her family's daily expenditures, Grace is hopeful that someday her dream will land in the palm of her hand. To make this happen, Grace wants to request a much larger loan to support the needs of her business and at the same time to sustain its operation. With her great passion for giving her children a better future and decent way of life, Grace will be willing to work hard and supplement her husband\u2019s irregular income as a doormat vendor.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a loving mother, Grace\u2019s dreams are always for her five children and family. She wants to bring her children a higher quality of life. In 2006, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. Grace hopes to secure access to capital for the continuation of her business. Her previous loans were carefully used as additional and rolling capital for her doormat-making business. \r\n<p>\r\nGrace is hopeful that her business will grow and that someday she will have more customers around the village. She also dreams of sending all her children to school until college so that they can get better jobs. One of her dreams is to be able to build her own house; one that is durable and spacious.

She has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately $100 when she sells a raised pig.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fely joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional animals. \r\n\r\nFely is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, cooking oil, and soda in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T14:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema E.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887026},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436286},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130558},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027355},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613356},{"amount":70.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010436}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T19:17:48Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":82758,"name":"Lourdes Ver\u00f3nica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lourdes es socia del Bancomunal San Juan\nLourdes es conviviente tiene 38 a\u00f1os, cuatro hijos de 20, 19, 16, y 13 a\u00f1os que esta en el colegio \nElla empez\u00f3 en el negocio de venta de cerveza vio la oportunidad por que por su casa hay una cancha deportiva y no se vend\u00eda nada, entonces ella empez\u00f3 vendiendo 10 cajas, actualmente vende 25 cajas en cada campeonato. \n\nNecesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1400 soles compra de cerveza, comprar juguetes por la campa\u00f1a de navidad y prendas interiores para la venta \nSu meta es poner una tienda bazar pues por su casa no hay tienda  \n","en":"Lourdes is a member of the San Juan cooperative bank.\r\n\r\nLourdes has a partner, is 38 years old, and has four children ages 20, 19, 16, and 13 who are in school.\r\n\r\nShe started her business selling beer after seeing an opportunity given her house\u2019s proximity to a sports field where nothing was sold to attendees.

Married to Ernesto C., a businessman, they are blessed with two children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn enough so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing three different types of businesses: her own tailoring shop, a buy-and-sell business and a charcoal repacking business.\r\n\r\nEvelyn has been a regular member of the Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her dues consistently. Because of her good repayment history with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she has used the money she has borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Evelyn would like to obtain a PHP 20,000 loan. This money will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business, and she will use it to incorporate more into her inventories and purchase the raw materials and supplies that she needs to continue her operations. Evelyn dreams that her business will continue to grow for her children\u2019s future.

Sra. Guadalupe F. C. is the group leader.  She is in a common law marriage and has three children:  Jair Vazquez F. (age 8), Jonathan Vazquez F. (age 15), and Cinthli Vazquez F. (age 17).  Her daughter helps with the business and is learning how to butcher the chickens.  The other children keep busy by helping to sell the chickens by the kilo.  Guadalupe has six years of experience in this business.  She has many customers and has the personality required to serve her customers well.  It is important to mention that Guadalupe is someone who is very conscious about the situation many Mexicans face during this time.  Therefore, she manages to sell her products at some of the best prices offered in the community.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group expresses their thanks for the trust and support placed in them by providing this opportunity.

Two of her children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nViola is a dairy farmer from the town of Litein in Rift Valley in Kenya. She has been farming for the last year and has employed one farmhand. Her main product is milk which she sells to Kenya Cooperative Creameries in Sotik town, Rift Valley, Kenya. She also operates a shop and a hotel (restaurant).\r\n\r\nHer biggest challenges in farming have been lack of enough land to keep more dairy cows, lack of funds to purchase both land and dairy cows and poor pricing that keeps fluctuating.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 50,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow. She says that this loan will enable the family to acquire another asset that will be used as security for subsequent loans. She will also earn extra income from the sale of milk.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to improve her dairy farming by buying quality dairy cows and building a modern dairy unit. She is grateful to Juhudi for the constant support and requests more funding in the

She comments that her community becomes very muddy and it\u2019s impossible for people to be completely clean.  This place is surrounded by corn fields, rocky and unpaved roads.  It\u2019s a cool place because there are many trees, bushes and the corn fields.\r\n\r\nJuana has seven children.  Two of her children are in elementary school because the oldest ones are working.  She is 42 years old and has been married for 22 years.  She has her own house and her husband\u2019s a merchant selling cleaning supplies on market days.  \r\n\r\nFor Juana it\u2019s always been very difficult to get ahead but now she\u2019s had a grocery store for two years, a small space she opened up in her house.  What has been difficult for her is going to get the merchandise.
