This is bad for business since he does not have many products for fulfilling the requests of his customers.  <br \/><br \/>Guillermo chose to request a loan so that he could get more organized and buy a large supply of necessities (grains, sugar, cookies, and dairy products) in order to increase his inventory and provide better customer service.

","en":"Dayana, who is 30-years old, lives in the south of the city with her husband and their two children, who are 2- and 7- years old respectively.  She sells goods such as wardrobe items, footwear, perfume, women's accessories and silver products.  She has four years of experience as a saleswoman and started this business with the intention of helping her husband develop the well-being of their household.  At the beginning, Dayana had the help of a friend, who would travel to Medell\u00edn, in Antioquia Department, to purchase leather products and clothing in the city's big industries.  The quality of the products there is exceptional.  Dayana's friend would supply her with these goods, and Dayana would distribute the items amongst her customers.  Her customer base increased little by little and her customers began to request other items, which grew Dayana's business.  She currently sells on credit.  Dayana has a big goal: to grow and expanding her small business, as she hopes to own her own house.  Dayana's working capital isn't sufficient to meet her orders, and that is the reason she turned to a Credikiva.  This is her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will purchase clothing, footwear, cologne, perfume and women's accessories, items that she needs to deliver.  The loan will also help her to increase her sales volume.

In this way, she has managed to make enough money to help her husband with the household bills.<br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda wants to branch out into selling lunches in her travelling sales business in order to improve the family's finances and get on. This is because her current customers are asking for this service, and she sees it as an opportunity to progress in the new work that she wants to start. This is why she is asking for help in the form of the loan. She will use it to buy a tricycle for home deliveries, a semi-industrial stove, kitchen utensils and ingredients such as vegetables, grains, and meat. This will let her get her new profitable project off the ground, and with it she hopes to improve her income.<br \/><br \/>With her drive, tenacity and desire to get on, Mar\u00eda wants to continue fighting so that in the future she can achieve her dream of owning her own house and creating new jobs.

Due to circumstances of life her parents separated leaving her mother to be the sole head of the family, fighting to give them an education but she was not able to and they decided to emigrate to Bogota where most of the family live. They hoped to improve their quality of life but things did not go as they hoped and Olga, at age 16, decided to work and postpone her studies and the dream of graduating from high school for the moment.\r\n\r\nAs could be expected in life love arrived and at that moment it was a solution to her problems. From that love an unexpected baby was born. It was very difficult for everyone, especially the mother, the underage child now has to grow up and assume the roll of mother. They are at a standstill but in her mind the dreams are always there to study and study. Getting a day job and with what she earned she paid for her studies and graduated from high school. It was a relief, but she wanted to continue studying even though her husband disagrees and sparks an obstacle.\r\n\r\nShe always wanted to belong to the guild of workers in the health field, especially dentistry, as when she lived in the village she loved to go to the routine tests for school and all that caught her attention. She began again to continue work but another unexpected new baby came along. It was difficult because once again she thought that she was going to have to hold back on the project, but the advice and the support of family and friends encouraged her to go ahead and to understand that the children were not an impediment to success but to fight for them. \r\n\r\nOnce again Olga planed to get a job putting aside her studies with a husband that does not agree with her projects and two children to bring up, but she is able to get a part time job where the bosses support her and give her the opportunity to study. She has to postpone a semester for financial reasons and gets a subsidy that ends. In the second semester she is acquainted with the Kiva program and decides to ask for help as her income does not help a lot as she also has other obligations and could not endure another delay for another semester having fought so much to commence it.\r\n\r\nShe wants to finish her studies, to be a dentist and specialize in orthodontics, and with new earnings buy a house and give her children a prosperous future and to help her parents to the end of their lives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1547091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-10T23:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-09T23:20:07Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":153531.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882876},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":153531.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202241},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":153531.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286382},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":153531.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225089}],"funded_date":"2014-03-11T00:12:26Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":679829,"name":"Yesica Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yesica se dedica desde hace varios a\u00f1os a la agricultura su principal siembra es el ma\u00edz y las hortalizas, cuando su cosecha ya esta lista la almacena en sacos as\u00ed como lo muestra la fotograf\u00eda para luego salir a comercializarlo a los diferentes mercados que se encuentran cerca de su lugar de residencia, con lo que obtiene de sus ganancias y con la ayuda de su esposo logran solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, vive en casa propia con sus hijos y su compa\u00f1ero de vida quien trabaja como alba\u00f1il y tambi\u00e9n le ayuda en la siembra, Yesica esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de semillas, fertilizantes, controles de plagas, abonos, herbicidas, etc. para poder seguir con su siembra y as\u00ed obtener mejores ganancias para darle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.

This will be their sixth loan as a group. \r\n\r\nThe women sell hair and body cream, deodorant, perfume, groceries and sewing accessories. \r\n\r\nLawrencia is a seamstress. She will use her loan to buy material, lining and thread from the wholesalers in Accra. She sews and then sells her products at her residence in Teshie. Her service is cash and carry.\r\n\r\nLawrencia earns a good profit and will make a good one from this loan, which she will invest in her business and use to repay her loan. This is her second loan from Kiva, and together with her friends, will need a total amount of GHS 3,200 to improve their

The two are produced under processes of certification - the coffee with the stamp \"Comercio Justo\" [\"Fair Trade\"] and the cocoa as certified organic. \r\n\r\nIn the last three years, his coffee production has been 300 quintals (30,000 pounds).

This small, rural entrepreneur has always been very careful in investing the funding that he has received in the activities for which he requests it and to reinvest, although it may be a small part of his utilities, in his own ranch.

Lisbeth shares that it is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible. With this loan, Lisbeth plans to purchase her much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Lisbeth feels she will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. With a degree in finance she expects to earn $20 a day. With one older sibling attending college already, Lisbeth is unsure how she will be able to finance her education on her own without the assistance of a Vittana Loan.

Juan shares that it is important to him to graduate on time so he can enter into the job market as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Juan plans to buy his schoolbooks.

Without the opportunity for a higher degree, his parents never had the chance to move up. Growing up, finances have always been tight. With six older siblings attending college already, Juan is unsure how he will be able to finance his education on his own without the assistance of a Vittana Loan.

Without the opportunity for a higher degree, her parents never had the chance to move up. Growing up, finances have always been tight.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAnabel hopes that her business will last longer and dreams to have other sources of income. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1439939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

For many years, she has not had a source of income. Her husband has a small salary and is not in a position to support the children with all the necessities. Year after year, the children demand more care since they are growing up in a developing world. She decided to organize a business raising livestock, since she has since childhood helped her parents with tending the livestock. She has long wanted help and finally she learned about the course \"Bring on Success\" organized by the Association of Business Women. She took part in this course and got a lot out of the experience for herself. After completing the course, she received a certificate. <br \/><br \/>Now, she is ready to begin a business but at the same time does not have money to purchase livestock. She will care for the livestock at her home, where she has a large cowshed. She plans to but livestock, fatten them over several months and to resell them at the local market. She is requesting a loan of 3,000 somoni to purchase livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1552396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy cattle for organizing a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2014-03-11T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-10T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulchehra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":211.94},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":220.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":219.65},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":237.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":237.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":242.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":256.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":260.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":267.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":274.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":282.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":289.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.1,"local_amount":0.5,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":0.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468205778},{"amount":0.65,"local_amount":3.13,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490823100},{"amount":2.69,"local_amount":12.9,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":12.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517531922},{"amount":621.56,"local_amount":2983.46,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2989.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531768865}],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T03:32:56Z","paid_date":"2014-09-25T09:12:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":681530,"name":"Estelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estelita works hard to support her family.

She gained a profit of 2,000,000 IDR for all. She\u2019s really grateful for that. She has a plan to use the profit to renovate her kitchen and for savings. During the last loan period, she didn't have a problem. All the pigs grew well. She said thanks to lenders, Kiva and MUK for supporting her business.\r\n\r\nThe Bun Lestari group is a group of women in the village who have the same effort: pig farming. They are joined in groups to get funding and training from MUK.\r\n\r\nNi Wayan is married with one child still in elementary school. Ni Wayan is using a loan to buy four piglets that will be maintained for five months for fattening. The remainder of the loan will be used to buy pig feed.\r\n\r\nNi Wayan spends 5,000 IDR for the kitchen per day and 100,000 IDR to pay for electricity and water per month. Although her business is still small, Ni Wayan hopes this business can support her child's education to buy books and for other school purposes, beside the kitchen needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3075,"image":{"id":1552207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy four piglets for fattening, and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-03-11T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-10T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":35000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":35000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3075,"local_amount":35000000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":35151555,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542554815}],"funded_date":"2014-03-13T14:49:17Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:09:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":681566,"name":"Dewi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dewi lives in Baturiti village where most of the population work as a fruit and vegetable growers.

She has been selling vegetables since 1996, when she first got started. She buys her good in a village about 60 km [37 miles] from the main town. Given that vegetables are sold at an affordable price [in the countryside], she prefers to restock there in order to increase her profit margin. Fanta buys wholesale, by bags, and resells to retailers who have small stands at the markets. She rises at 5 AM to deliver her merchandise and finishes at 10 AM. She already obtained a loan from IMCEC in the past.

He is very kind and hardworking. Nuriddin lives in a village located not far from the district. Since childhood, Nuriddin has loved nature, fresh air and, last by not least, animals. When he was a kid, Nuriddin helped his parents fatten up cattle. Eventually, he began to raise them on his own. The knowledge and skills his learned form his father have helped him in this business. As a result of his circumstances, Nuriddin was unable to receive a secondary-specialized education. But he wants to give his children a complete education in the future. Nuriddin is raising a son. He has a young family. Nuriddin's wife works in the fields, weeding the land. In addition to this, she cultures milk at home and prepares kefir and sour cream which she sells to their neighbors.

He is married and has three children. Nazir lives with his family in a rural village. He strives to work as much as possible so that there are sufficient funds for a good quality of life. From a young age, he helped his father grow various crops in the fields. From then on, he learned how to do this business very well. Now Nazir runs his own business of crop and vegetable farming. <br \/><br \/>For around 11 years, he has been growing crops, onions and grapes. He has a small plot of land for this. On this plot of land he also grazes cattle, which he raises for future sale. His family helps him with this.

They practice livestock breeding. Makhliyo raises cattle then sells the milk and meat from them. Makhliyo receives a good income from this business. Makhliyo's husband also practices crop farming and his work brings in additional revenue for the family. Their combined income is enough for an average standard of living. At the moment, they do not have enough money to cover all of their current needs. Now Makhliyo and her husband want to buy several cattle to fatten them up. This is why she turned to Arvand to take out a loan to buy cattle. Makhliyo thanks Arvand in advance for their support, as it will improve her family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1550250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her family also has an additional income from her husband, who works as a home repair foreman. <br \/><br \/>In order to have a good income to cover living expenses, Maysara works at home as a seamstress. She learned this trade from her mother. Now she sews ethnic Tajik items and women's dresses. She already has loyal customers who really like how Maysara does her work - carefully and beautifully. Now Maysara wants to buy a new sewing machine, as the machine she currently has does not work very well.

kind-hearted and cheerful 27-year-old man. He is married and has two children. Sirojiddin lives with his wife in a small house in a rural village. In order to feed his family, he works as a tractor operator as well as having his own business. <br \/><br \/>Sirojiddin practices livestock breeding. He has a plot of land. From the total area of land, several portions of the land are left as non-irrigated land. The rest of the plot is made up of irrigated land. On this land he grows carrots, potatoes and grains. His wife helps him look after and raise cattle.  As their plot of land is large, they also graze their cattle there. The business of livestock breeding brings in a good income, which is why Sirojiddin decided to expand his business by increasing the size of his herd. He turned to Arvand to request a loan to buy cattle. Sirojiddin really relies on a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1546524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Now, by ensuring that her agribusiness is successful and she is able to provide monthly payments for this loan, Siran has been approved for this loan. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

She now owns and manages a cafe. She was sitting in the cafe with friends when her friend said she wanted to sell the cafe. She wanted to follow her dreams of running her own business and being her own boss. She told her family and with their support she bought the cafe three years ago. She's had good profits for three years. She comes in contact with people from all walks of life and is very pleased with her business. The cafe is always full because it is on the shore. It gets busier in the summer months and stays open until 3 AM. This job puts her in charge. It has taught her the value of money and that money isn't easy to earn. She will buy goods for the cafe with this loan. She thinks that the cafe will have more business and wants to make innovations and changes. She wants to use the money she makes to buy her family a bigger house. \r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n\u00dcyemiz on yedi y\u0131l de\u011fi\u015fik \u015firketlerde sigortac\u0131l\u0131k yap\u0131yor.  \u015eu an sahip oldu\u011fu cafeyi arkada\u015f\u0131 i\u015fletiyor mu\u015f,arkada\u015flarla cafe de otururken arkada\u015f\u0131 cafeyi satmak istedi\u011fini s\u00f6yl\u00fcyor.Kendi hayalinde hep kendi i\u015fini yapmak ve patron olmak oldu\u011fundan cafeyi almak istiyor.
