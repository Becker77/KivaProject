She used the previous loans, all of which were paid back successfully, to buy a stock of medicine for her pharmacy. She repaired her pharmacy with new doors made of aluminum, and shelves for medicine keeping. Herieth managed to receive extra income, which she used to buy a farm and covered part of the school fees for her children. \r\n\r\nHerieth is thankful for everyone who has supported her group with the loan.

His son still lives with Serob and he does different constructional works in their village. Serob and his wife earn their family living through farming and agricultural activities. They have a rich fruit garden full of fig, persimmon and apple trees, and a vegetable garden where they raise tomatoes, greens and beans. They also cultivate wheat, with which they make flour to use both for their family and to sell. \r\n\r\nSerob mainly cares for their farm cattle. In his farm he has two cows, three piglets and twenty chickens. Serob says that his wife manages to attract many re-sellers who used to buy from their farm meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables - the costs of which are suitable both for Serob and for buyers. Serob now has plans to make both his farm and fruit garden richer. That is why he asks for a loan of 1,000,000 AMD in order to buy a cow, some animal fodder and also several new layers for his fruit garden.

Artur\u2019s mother works at home where she makes very tasty cakes and different pastries. \r\n\r\nArtur for several years worked at a poultry farm as a delivery person, and then for five years he worked as a driver at a private company. Now with his own car, he provides taxi services. Despite his work, this young man is also seriously engaged in swine breeding and agriculture. In his farm, he has five piglets, 30 chickens, two beehives and a large fruit garden where he has many apple and persimmon trees. His mother uses the farm eggs for her small pastry business. Thanks to his hardworking and active character, Atur manages to have good yield. From his farm, he also sells meat and fruits. Artur wants to enlarge his farm and so he decided to ask for a loan from Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nHe asks for a loan of 1,000,000 AMD in order to buy two new pigs and fodder for his pigs as well as

Together with his wife they take care of two cows, three piglets and 25 chickens. \r\n\r\nOn his plot of land Arman cultivates grain and fruits such as figs, pears, apples and nuts. All his farm products Arman sells at the Ijevan wholesale market. Arman also gives private car repairing services in his village. As he says, being engaged in different activities helps him to provide his family with normal living conditions.\r\n\r\nArman asks a loan of 1.200.000 Armenian drams since he wants to make his fruit garden bigger and buy layers for the fruit garden.

Anush is married and has a son, who is already married.  He and his family live with her.  He has two children. Anush is a very laborious and active woman. At a very young age she lost her husband.  She used to solve all kinds of problems alone, despite her being a fragile and tender woman.  Anush had a clothes trading business, but now she works at a hotel as an administrator. Her son is a taxi driver. Together they try to provide for their family living, and sometimes they have a great lack of money.  Anush wants very much to make her grandchildren\u2019s lives more comfortable.  She asks for a loan of 1,000,000 AMD to buy furniture for their bedroom.

After her divorce from her husband, it was difficult for Nasiba to find enough funds to live on but she tried her best not to lose heart. She was able to raise her children on her own. Nasiba sells merchandise at the local market. She sells sugar and different types of candy. She has a good, steady income from this business. <br \/><br \/>Now Nasiba's eldest daughter is already grownup and she wants to get married. In connection with this, Nasiba has now begun gathering all of the necessary items for her daughter's dowry. From the profit she earned from her business, Nasiba bought many different things for her daughter's dowry. The only thing she has left is to buy furniture, but she practically doesn't have any money left. This is why Nasiba turned to Arvand to request a loan to buy furniture for her daughter's dowry. She really relies on a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1546532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy furniture for her daughter's dowry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-03-12T16:40:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-11T16:40:21Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasiba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":552},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":571.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":591.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":612.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":633.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":655.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":678.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":705.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.92,"local_amount":552,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":557.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479181043},{"amount":119.98,"local_amount":571.32,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":577.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875640},{"amount":124.18,"local_amount":591.32,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":597.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302866},{"amount":128.52,"local_amount":612.01,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":618.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585667},{"amount":561.4,"local_amount":2673.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2700.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081247}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T19:32:24Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":681876,"name":"Kalsoom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kalsoom is a 33-year-old, married woman, and mother of six children.

She looks after the buffaloes and performs the task of collecting milk from them while her husband sells it to different places on a daily basis. They are happily doing this together to support their family. \r\n\r\nShe needs to earn much more to meet their everyday expenditures including food, clothing, and education. In order to make bigger profits, she requested a loan of 40,000 PKR to buy one more buffalo to cater to more customers. In addition, it will allow her to increase her sales and profits.

She generates income through various activities. She sells various cosmetics, clothing, and more. She also sells lunches and offers the rental of washing machines to her neighborhood. Her experience began in 2009. She knew the craft of sewing clothes and dedicated herself strongly to it in order to  generate enough income to meet the expenses for her family's welfare. Today, her business has grown and she sells clothing for cash and on credit. She purchases wholesale to get good prices and volume.

Her goal and challenge is for her young daughter to do well in her studies so she can achieve future success. Her current working capital is insufficient to meet her plans for growth which is precisely why Dary applied for a Kiva loan, her first though Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to purchase ingredients to increase the production of lunches, to buy a washing machine to provide more efficient service, and to achieve increased profits ensuring that her investment is very effective.

Santos, at 33 years old, is a persistent and hardworking woman. She is a single mother with a son who is completely under her care. She completed her primary schooling. Thanks to the efforts of her parents, who supported her in all aspects, she was able to finish this schooling despite various economic difficulties. She rears pigs, which she learned over 5 years ago through training events in the community thanks to a local institution.  At the time of butchering, her customers are residents of her community. She helps her brother-in-law in developing the heavier tasks at the time of butchering.\r\n\r\nHer plans and dreams are to grow her business by buying more pigs to fatten, improving her income through selling meat, and helping her son in his studies with the income generated from this, as it is her only source of income. For this reason she is requesting financing to buy concentrate for fattening pigs as well as growth injections. Through this, her production will yield better results in the coming months, thus improving her income and other needs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1549769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy materials to rear and fatten pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-03-12T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-11T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

After her husband died she raised her two children by herself.  Her eldest son is a taxi driver.  The younger one repairs cars and helps his mother around the house.  Mariya has a high school education.  As the family's main breadwinner, she raises livestock and grows crops.  She started out 29 years ago by purchasing cattle for 1200 soms.  Thanks to her persistent hard work the farm now has one milk cow, one steer, and two hectares of land where every year she grows potatoes to sell and use within the business.  Her monthly income is 12,000 soms.  To further develop her farm, Mariya has turned to the Bai Tulum Bank for a loan so she can buy steer to increase the herd.

Gulgaky has a secondary education and has very good references from her neighbors. They speak of her as a kind and hardworking woman. Since 1995, she has been selling food products as the main source of income for her family. Her selection of goods includes different types of cookies, candy, baked goods, juice, mayonnaise and other products. She started this business with initial start-up capital in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulgaky's hard work, she has been able to develop and expand her merchandise. Her business brings in about 25,000 som (KGS) per month,  which serves as the basis for covering her family's food expenses and daily living needs. As additional income for their family, Gulgaky and her brother have also been practicing livestock breeding for many years. They started this business with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulgaky's hard work, she currently has 1 calf and 10 sheep on her farm. The income from her sales business and from livestock breeding allowed Gulgaky to expand her sales volume and buy a car. For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulgaky turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy wholesale food products for future retail sale. Gulgaky plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the future enlargement of her business. She also intends to repair her house in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1554214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

His practice is to buy fabrics from wholesalers, dye them into multiple shades and sell them into the market. He has lots of customers who like to buy fabrics from him. Due to new customers, the demand is increasing day by day, but he does not have sufficient capital to buy more fabrics. Therefore, Shama has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband can buy more fabrics to fulfill the demand.\r\n\r\nShama is in her seventh loan cycle and has shown an excellent repayment behavior.

He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of leather for production. Marcilio has been selling through NOVICA since 2004. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I am a sculptor, art director and teacher specializing in masks. The basis of my formation was architecture, a course where I discovered myself as an artist and from where launched my search as a self-taught creator. My work with masks has its beginning with puppet theaters. I applied the concepts of architecture \u2013 that is, the organization of space \u2013 to the microcosm of the face. Brazil is a country of racial mixtures with an enormous diversity of human types and archetypes. It is as if all of the masks of the world have passed through here.

her husband, is raising three children. Mariya has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Mariya practices crop farming and livestock breeding. She started this business 18 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Mariya's hard work, she currently has a 2.80 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes every year and sows grains and sainfoin for personal consumption and sale. She also has 1 milk cow, 1 horse and 5 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

Mukarram's husband died many years ago from an illness, after which she did not have another relationship. She raised her children by herself. She is a very attentive mother. She tried with all her strength to make a good home for her children so that her children had comfortable lives and didn't want for anything or felt the absence of their father. Mukarram was both a father and a mother to her children.<br \/><br \/>Mukarram has sold goods at the market for several years in a row already. She sells vegetables, specifically yellow onions. Mukarram has a lot of experience in this field. She has sold at the market for more than 10 years. Over these long years, she has won dozens of loyal customers. As she herself says, \"Thanks to my small business, I improved my family's lives and married off my daughter.\" Mukarram would like to expand her sale volume, as well as increase the variety of her assortment of vegetables. But the money she has already saved is not enough for a turnover of goods, which is why she is requesting a loan from Arvand in the hope that this organization will not refuse her and will assist her financially."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1552551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables for retail sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-03-12T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-11T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukarram","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1619.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1714.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":359.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":340.1,"local_amount":1619.5,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1636.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479181045},{"amount":349.92,"local_amount":1666.3,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1683.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875642},{"amount":359.98,"local_amount":1714.2,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1731.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302868}],"funded_date":"2014-03-12T22:32:28Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":681808,"name":"Danaya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9es majoritairement dans des m\u00e9nages monogamiques, les sept  membres du groupe Danaya ont en moyenne 36 ans et 4 enfants.

As the main source of income for her family, Jyldyzkan practices livestock breeding. She started this business 12 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Jyldyzkan's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow and 5 goats on her farm. Her monthly income is 9,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Jyldyzkan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy a cow to increase the size of her herd.

As the main source of income for her family, Gulsada practices livestock breeding. She started this business 19 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulsada's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 20 sheep and 2 heifers on her farm, as well as a 1.54 hectare plot of irrigated land where she mainly plants beans. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulsada turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd.

","en":"Gulzada is 57 years old and a widow. Her husband died suddenly in 1999. Since then, she has been raising her four children by herself. Gulzada has a secondary-specialized education. She works as a nurse at a local hospital. As an additional source of income for her family, Gulzada practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 38 years ago with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulzada's hard work, she currently has 1 horse and 10 sheep on her farm, as well as a 1.92 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans every year for personal consumption and sale. Her cumulative monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulzada turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy mineral fertilizers, saltpeter fertilizers and ammonium phosphate fertilizers to till her land.

She did not complete primary education due to a lack of economic support in her family. Her parents could only support her studies until her 5th year. She is a single mother of 2 children who are of legal age and who only live at home with their mother part-time. She is a farmer and a homemaker who is responsible for various field jobs, such as maintaining her coffee plants, applying fertilizer, and others that help protect and maintain them. From a very early age she learned to develop such activities from her parents. She works on her own land, which is located 5 minutes by foot from her house.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to become one of the strongest coffee producing areas and thus inherit the land on which her family now works, and to reinforce patrimony for her children and that they continue to work on the land, and to improve their situation more and more each day through her income. Thus, she is now requesting a loan in order to buy agricultural supplies to help and contribute to the continuous improvement of her coffee plants, as her income solely depends on this item. For this reason, she needs to keep her crops protected in the hopes of being supported in buying what she needs.\r\n\r\n
