She is 50 years old and she is happily married to Bernardo who works as a farmer.  God has blessed them with three loving children and all of them are still studying in school.  Life indeed is hard.  But by the grace of God, they were able to raise their children well and they are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nRosaly owns a variety store.  This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses.  This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg and other things.  She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price and then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to get a profit.  Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby and the people in the community.  She earns a minimum of  PHP 600 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan.  She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nRosaly dreams to be successful in her business and hopes to give her family a good life.

She will use the Kes 100,000 loan to add more M-pesa float, i.e., money for customers to withdraw. Her business goal is to expand within five years. She hopes that in the future, she will improve her standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis is Mercy's second loan with SMEP DTM. Her previous loan of Kes 20,000 was repaid successfully.

She is requesting a loan to be able to cover all of her education expenses.  This is her story.\r\n\r\nMy name is Rosa Esther, and I am 18 years old.  I live with my parents.  I am the older of two sisters.  I was born and grew up in Santo Domingo.  My mother is a nurse.  Currently the only income in my household is from my mother because my father has been unemployed for some time.\r\n\r\nI attend the Universidad Apec, and I am in the second semester of Business Administration.  I am studying this career because I love the field of business, the interaction with people, and the relationship between businesses and business people.  Some of the subjects I have taken are marketing, business ethics, and administration.  These are the ones that I have liked the most because they go along with my career.\r\n\r\nThe need for this loan is that my family is not able to pay for my studies.  Therefore, I am addressing you so that you can make my dream of finishing my studies possible.  If I do not receive the loan, I will not finish my education.  As I told you earlier, we do not have the resources needed for this.  Completing my education depends completely on the loan.\r\n\r\nMy goals are to complete my studies in order to be able to help my family and to give them all of the support they need.  Another goal is to be able to get along in the work force.  I would like to work at a company in the area of management or in human resources in order to contribute to society.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1550491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He has spent all his savings to buy cast iron for manufacturing spare parts and he does not have money to fix the lathe machine.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Parveen has requested a loan for her husband, so that he could fix the lathe machine.

She has become expert in her art and wants to buy raw materials on her own so that she can sell her hand-made embroidery in her hometown.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Annah has requested a loan to buy raw materials so she can make more embroidered dresses to sell and can generate maximum income.

People like his art and appreciate his efforts. \r\n\r\nHe wants to cope with the demand for bridal dresses; that is why he wants to buy stock of thread, fancy cloth, sequins, and pearls of various colors in addition.\r\n\r\nAzra requires some capital to buy the desired inventory for her husband but she does not have a sufficient amount. For that reason, she humbly requested  BRAC Pakistan for a loan. Using this loan her husband would be able to buy stocks of thread, fancy cloth, sequins, and pearls of various colors. Azra is very glad and thankful to BRAC Pakistan.

Aiyda has a secondary-specialized education. She graduated from a technical college with a degree as a chef. She began her professional career in secondary school, then she got married, but she continued to work. Aiyda is very responsible, gregarious and cheerful by nature. Aiyda and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. They started this business 20 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aiyda's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 2 horses on her farm. Her monthly income is 16,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk, as well as cultivating a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she mainly grows beans and potatoes. The received harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Aiyda turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. After the purchase of the cattle, they will be located on their own farm. In the summer, they will be under the care of a shepherd. Aiyda plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for her children's university educations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1555850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tash-Bashat village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-03-13T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-12T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aiyda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":555},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":740}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":555,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":30247.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440490},{"amount":555,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":30247.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579488933},{"amount":740,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40330.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436112}],"funded_date":"2014-03-25T17:00:32Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":682414,"name":"Dave","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dave's previous loan was used to expand the existing animal stable.

He is married and has four children. Abduvafo lives with his family in a small village. Right after Abduvafo graduated from school, he began to help his father with his farm. He was unable to receive a higher education because of financial difficulties in his family. Then he got married. Now, in order to have a stable income for his family, he raises and sells cattle. His wife is a homemaker. She does work around the house and raises their children. She is a very kind woman. Besides this, they have a small plot of land on which they work long and hard so that they can provide for their children and give them a well-deserved education. <br \/><br \/>Abduvafo currently wants to expand his business so that, in the future, he can receive a larger profit and spend it on all of his family's needs. He needs to buy several cows and livestock feed. But Abduvafo does not have enough money for this. This is why Abduvafo is requesting a loan from Arvand to buy livestock feed. He turned to Arvand in the the hope that they would help him with this. He thanks them in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1548186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

children. Gulnara has a secondary education. She got married very young. Gulnara and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 18 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulnara's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 2 calves on her farm. Her monthly income is 16,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk as well as from cultivating a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she mainly grows beans and peppers. The received harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulnara turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. After purchasing the cattle, they will be located on her farm. In the summer, they will be under the care of a shepherd.

Nurgul has a secondary education and is a homemaker. Nurgul is very responsible, gregarious and cheerful by nature. Nurgul and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 5 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nurgul's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 4 bull calves, 90 sheep and 2 horses on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk as well as from cultivating a 1.40 hectare plot of land on which she mainly grows beans. The received harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Nurgul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy sheep to increase the size of her herd.

He used an animal-powered wagon, but unfortunately his horse died of old age. He did not have enough money to buy another animal, so was not able to carry on that work.

Vihiga County, Kenya, with her family that includes 2 children. The community of Bahani village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Bahani\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by drinking unsafe water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Bahani village, 40 households will benefit from having access to safe water through the dispenser. Miriam has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter and will be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine and encouraging the whole community to treat their water in order to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy. There is another volunteer promoter named Robai from the surrounding community who is part of this group loan.\n\nBahani village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers in the area. Miriam believes that chlorine dispenser use will save them from water-borne diseases.

Lilian is friendly, reliable and a well-liked member of the community with 5 children. Lilian lives with her family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor and iron roof.\n\nVitembe village does not have a piped water supply so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water at the point of collection to make it safe to drink. Lilian\u2019s family and 74 other households using the local water sources need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nLilian has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill the dispenser with chlorine when the tank runs low. Lilian volunteered to be the promoter because she wants to help her community prevent water-borne diseases. Lilian believes that through chlorine dispenser adoption, her community will keep water-borne diseases at bay. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding communities who are part of this group loan: Anjelyne, Jeridah, Linet and Flora.\n\nEvidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and to make sure that Lilian\u2019s community can

village in Vihiga County, Kenya, with her family that includes 8 children. The community of Lianaginga village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases often making Lianaginga\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by drinking unsafe water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Lianaginga village, 40 households will benefit from having access to safe water through the dispenser. Rasoa has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter and will be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine and encouraging the whole community to treat their water in order to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding communities who are part of this group loan: Esther, Jerida, Benson and Gilbert.\n\n Lianaginga village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers in the area. Rasoa believes that chlorine dispenser saves lives. Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Chambali village, 34 households will benefit from having access to safe water through the dispenser. Mable has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter and will be responsible for refilling the dispenser with chlorine and encouraging the whole community to treat their water in order to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy.

She is a widow and lives with a daughter and a son in an IDP settlement. She is a farmer and raises seasonal vegetables such as cucumbers, potatoes, tomatoes and greens. Her monthly income is 120 AZN. \r\n\r\nTahira has worked in this field for 34 years and she knows everything of farming. She also knows that seasonal vegetables aren't as profitable as she wants. But unfortunately she cannot raise other kinds of vegetables because of the cold climate in her region. People have high demands for fresh vegetables, especially greens because they are very good for health. People also use greens to prepare such national dishes as green qutab, dovgha, doghramaj, etc.\r\n\r\nTahira\u2019s income is not enough for her to cover her family\u2019s demands. She decided to build a greenhouse for her vegetables and buy additional vegetable seeds. That is why she applied for 1500 AZN loan from the credit union. She believes that this will help her to increase her income and be able to escape  debts in future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1554224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

","en":"Zaripa is 47 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising three children. Zaripa has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Zaripa practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 25 years ago with 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zaripa's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow on her farm, as well as a 1.30 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows peppers, tomatoes, watermelons and cotton for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

children. Aigul has a secondary education. Aigul and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 8 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aigul's hard work, she currently has 4 milk cows and 12 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk as well as from cultivating a 2.34 hectare plot of land on which she mainly grows watermelons, tomatoes, peppers and cotton. The received harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Aigul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. After purchasing the cattle, they will be located on her farm. In the summer, they will be under the care of a shepherd. Aigul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to buy a family car."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1555895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Tuu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-03-13T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-12T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aigul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":555,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-19T09:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30247.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463151},{"amount":370,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T09:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947169},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":25206.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440493},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25206.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579488937}],"funded_date":"2014-03-14T16:35:26Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":678406,"name":"Vaise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vaise is a 47-year-old married woman with eight children.

","en":"Ainura is 26 years old and married; she and her husband are raising two children. Ainura has received a college  degree. She works as an accountant for the village administration. As an additional source of income for her family, Ainura grows produce and raises livestock, having launched this eight years ago with a starting capital of 5,000 KGS. Thanks to Ainura's hard work, at present she has one dairy cow and two calves. She also has a land plot of 6.2 ha [15.3 acres], where she  annually grows beans for family use as well as for sale. The total income from her farm is 16,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, Ainura has applied to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan to buy high-quality bean seeds before the planting season. Ainura plans to have a large harvest, which will no doubt increase her family's working capital. Ainura plans to use the revenues for her loan to increase her livestock. She also plans to save up to pay for future education of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1555925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Gulupa is 34 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising two children. Gulupa has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Gulupa practices livestock breeding. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 12,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulupa's hard work, she currently has 3 milk cows, 1 calf, 10 sheep and lambs on her farm. Her monthly income is 13,000 som (KGS).

 ","en":"Tojiniso is a hardworking country woman from the Yavan District. She is 49 years old. She grew up in the family of a communal farmer and has been familiar with agricultural farming since childhood. After graduating from school, Tojiniso got married and gave birth to six children. She and her husband have four sons and two daughters who range from 15 to 28 years old.  <br \/><br \/>For the past 12 years, Tojiniso and her family have actively taken up crop farming.

She is married; her husband has worked in agriculture for many years.\r\n\r\nThey have five children together, all of whom work independently.  The children live in their own homes.  Four people live in Amanda\u2019s house: her husband and the two grandchildren they care for because the grandchildren\u2019s parents live far away.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years, Amanda has worked selling dairy products.  Her mother taught her this work, because when Amanda was young her mother took her to make sales with her, and she has continued this business since then.  The client also works helping her husband in agriculture.  She decided to work in this area because she likes to do it and it is a way to help her family and her husband with the household expenses.  To sell her products, she travels to the closest town, which is ten kilometers from her community.  She travels by bus to get there and then makes sales door-to-door until she is finished.  Her schedule consists of about six hours per day. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy a dairy heifer, which will come to improve her business, because she will have the chance to sell more and make cheese once the heifer produces milk.  This will improve her income and will better cover any one-time expenses of her family.\r\n\r\nThe client\u2019s dreams are the same ones she has had for thirty years: to keep working for her family, that her family would achieve their goals, and that she can help them as much as she can.  As for her business, she dreams of having her own sales stand where she would no longer have to travel to sell her products, because due to her age, traveling is difficult.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help her to improve her business through sales.  She says that she will expand her business, buying more heifers in the future so that they produce even more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1550638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy heifer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-03-14T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-13T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amanda De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":420.91,"local_amount":420.91,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":420.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832282},{"amount":579.09,"local_amount":579.09,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":579.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201835}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T21:07:32Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:04:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":682522,"name":"Sauda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sauda is a hardworking and enterprising woman.

Se ha dedicado a esta actividad desde que era muy peque\u00f1o,  su padre de \u00e9l le ense\u00f1o a trabajar en el campo. Desde que este era muy joven, Wilfredo decide dedicarse a esta actividad porque no encontr\u00f3 otra forma de ayudar a su familia y sacarlos adelante, el trabajo del cliente est\u00e1 a dos cuadras de su casa, las cuales tiene que recorrer para llegar a ella.  La dificultad m\u00e1s grande que tiene es llevar los insumos que necesita para trabajar la agricultura, ya que recorre 23 kil\u00f3metros en carro que paga,  para que le lleven los insumos hasta su casa.

Con la ganancia y un poco de ahorro ampliara su negocio comprando su propio terreno para cultivar. \n\n","en":"Wilfredo, age 26, studied through the eighth grade. He has a partner, who works doing the household chores.  From time to time, she also works in retail seasonally.  They have two children together, who live with them.  One studies in preschool and the other does not.  Only his partner and their two children live in his house.\r\n\r\nWilfredo works in agriculture and fishing, although his stronger source of income (or that which he works in more) is agriculture.  He has done this type of work since he was very little; his father taught him to work in the fields.  From the time he was very young, Wilfredo decided to do this work because he couldn\u2019t find another way to help his family and get them ahead.  He works two blocks from his home, which he has to travel to get to work.  The biggest difficulty he faces is carrying the supplies that he needs to do his work, because he travels 23 kilometers in a car that he pays for so that he can get the supplies to his home.  His partner also helps him in his work when he needs.  He works about seven hours daily.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Credicampo is to rent the land where he will work this season, and to buy two fishing nets, because fishing allows him to have extra income and helps to improve the living conditions of his family by selling the fish.  The need that he has to take care of is securing a place to work and feeding his family this season.\r\n\r\nThe client dreams of seeing his children study and complete a university degree.  He dreams of them having a stable job that allows them to have a decent life.  Wilfredo wants to keep harvesting so that some day he can set up his own business selling pantry staples.  With the earnings and a little bit of savings he will expand his business by buying his own piece of land to cultivate."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1550653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Land

married and has three children. She is an active and hardworking woman. She is 40 years old. She has a secondary education. Like many of her fellow villagers, her life worked out such that she was unable to get a higher education. However, she has dreamed her whole life that her children would get a good education and, in the future, become great specialists who are capable of making their lives happier and more self-sufficient. She and her husband do all that they can to achieve this goal. <br \/><br \/>Mutabarbonu and her husband have a family business. They raise cattle and process their milk. The income from this business provides for the lives of their family, of course, but it is not enough to put aside for their children's education. Mutabarbonu decided to take out a loan to buy quality feed to increase the profitability of their business and save money for their goal - their children's education. Mutabarbonu is happy that she is able to take out a loan from Arvand and become one step closer to realizing her dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1552464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy quality livestock feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-03-14T02:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-13T02:10:10Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mutabarbonu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":138.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":142.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":147.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":152.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":157.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":163.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":168.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":174.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":180.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":186.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":192.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":194.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.37,"local_amount":138.2,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T13:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":141.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479181048},{"amount":30.36,"local_amount":142.88,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":146.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875645},{"amount":31.39,"local_amount":147.73,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":151.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302871},{"amount":32.46,"local_amount":152.74,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":156.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585671},{"amount":33.56,"local_amount":157.91,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":161.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081251},{"amount":34.69,"local_amount":163.27,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":166.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562131},{"amount":35.87,"local_amount":168.8,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":172.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694822},{"amount":37.09,"local_amount":174.52,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":178.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626615},{"amount":158.47,"local_amount":753.95,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":770.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.74,"payment_id":595209108}],"funded_date":"2014-03-19T01:08:29Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T14:13:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":682531,"name":"Pathano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pathano is a 51-year-old married woman.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe works in the animal sales' business.

He is married and has five children.  All of his children are already grown and have their own families.  Yuldosh lives with his wife in a small house in a village.  Despite his age, he is full of strength and desire to work for the welfare of his family.  Yuldosh is involved in farming and animal husbandry.  He has a land plot.  Out of all his land, 8 hectares are rainfed land and the rest of the area is irrigated land.  Yuldosh grows carrots, potatoes and cereal crops on this land.  And his wife helps him to take care of and raise livestock.  She also works as a cook at a local hospital.\r\n\r\nYuldosh tries to work a lot in order to have enough means for a decent living.  He earns a small income from his business.  His son, who works in Russia and sends money every month, also helps him.

They played a good role in grooming her by giving her what she needs for her studies and also supporting her morally and financially. After the post school, she started tutoring children at home and generated an income to pay for her college fees.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to hold the Indian Administrative Service (most desirable job in India) after her completion of graduation, but family members usually discouraged her with lack of financial security because one needs to get vigorous coaching to crack the Indian Administrative Examination. \r\n \r\nHer dream was crushed because there was no one to support her financially, but then Lhingneikim got selected in the aviation industry as a cabin crew member. Her selection as a cabin crew in the aviation industry was a life saver for her maternal uncle because he is supporting her and her younger brother in pursuing their education. She had mixed feelings of both worry and elation because the job is at hand while she has to make a refundable deposit against the job towards the company. Her colleague who also got selected for the cabin crew and also is a member of Kiva introduced her to WSDS and now she can pay the deposit and be a successful cabin crew member. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will pay her deposit and will join the aviation industry.

Thank God, we were able to keep the workshop and get through those tough times.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"To the friends who support me, thank you very much for this microcredit.
