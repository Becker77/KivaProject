is the Hope). She lives with her long-term partner and their four children in a simple structure, located in a rural community in La Romana. The community is a batey (company town) founded for sugarcane workers where she, her family, and the other 14 female micro-entrepreneurs in this group reside. Josefa has been taking out loans with Esperanza for about four years and she is excited to receive her eighth loan from Esperanza, as each previous loan helped her to improve her business. \r\n\r\nJosefa says that her most important goals are to have her own house in the main city and to raise, educate, and support her children. She operates a fruit and vegetable stall, from which she sells goods her customers use to make their daily food. Normally she sells to her neighbors.

Specifically, the community is a batey (company town) founded for sugarcane workers. \r\n\r\nGerta says that her most important challenge is to have her own house and to raise her children in a safe home and support all their needs. She operates a food stall, where she sells meat. It runs like a fried food stall as well as a butcher shop, as she can sell the meat cooked, mostly for dinner. She also sells other goods for daily meals. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business to buy more different meats and some vegetables and fruit. \r\n\r\nGerta is excited to receive her seventh loan with Esperanza, each one helping her to improve her business. With her profits, she will reinvest in her business and save. Gerta thanks all of you for your support of her business and her group.

","en":"Guljamal is 50 and married with three children. Her older daughters are married and her son is in school. Guljamal has a high school education and works in agriculture and animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she started 19 years ago with 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has one milking cow and eight sheep as well as 1.75 hectares of farmland, on which she grows beans both for household consumption and for sale. Her total monthly income is 10,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Guljamal has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan to purchase fertilizer for her land. She wants to receive a good harvest, which will contribute positively to her household finances. Guljamal plans to invest profits from the loan into buying more animals, and to save toward her son's education costs.

He is not yet married, but he is planning to get married in the near future. Until then, Khusrav lives with his parents in a small village. After graduating from secondary school, Khusrav tried to enroll in a university, but he was unsuccessful in getting admitted for a free education. He did not have the opportunity to enroll for a tuition-based education. This is why Khusrav began to look for work right after finishing school. <br \/><br \/>Khusrav currently buys and sell dried fruit. He has his own stall for this at the local bazaar. He receives a good, steady income from this business.

This has allowed her to gain contracts in order to produce different types of clothing, particularly for babies and children.\r\n\r\nWith a desire to strengthen and establish her business, Julia is applying for a loan in order to buy supplies (materials, threads, needles and springs) in bulk. This will allow her to completely a particularly big job that she is working on. She will be able to complete the project with skill and deliver it on time and at a high quality. This will open the door to new and bigger contracts and she will be able to fulfill her dream of expanding her workshop and offering jobs to other mothers who run their households. This will all be reflected as Julia's living conditions improve. She will be able to continue supporting her son financially, so that he can study at a good university and become a prosperous professional."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1549796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products, like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to expand her business and dreams to have a good life. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She plans to use her loan to buy 125 kilograms of fresh fish in Kabala on the banks of the Niger river. She will sell the fish for cash and for credit at the market and as an itinerant seller to a mixed clientele. With this loan Mrs. Awa hopes to make an average monthly profit of 100 000 FCFA which she will use to reinvest in her business and to provide for her children's needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1543273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-03-14T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-13T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efch\u00e9                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efchata            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lala                A\u00efch\u00e9      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T16:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":208982.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468045875},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":208982.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263726},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":208982.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960605},{"amount":441.66,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":208982.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504676966},{"amount":441.66,"local_amount":208333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":208982.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676660},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":208333.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":208982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209104}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T13:44:48Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:27:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":677613,"name":"Suomo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These two gentlemen are part of the group called Suomo.

Therefore, Naseem has applied for Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

It is made up of four members and is represented by Eunice. The businesses that the members of the group run are varied and include selling groceries, canned food, fast food, ready-made dresses, fruits and materials.\n\nThe loan that they will receive will benefit small businesses, including that of Eunice. She says that this is the sixth loan that she has worked with ID-Ghana, and the second with Kiva. She says that she became involved with it through her aunt's invitation. She has been selling groceries, fast food and canned food for seven years. She started this business after observing that this is one of the most sold goods in the community. It is for this reason that she used her scant resources to start this business.\n\nThe loan that she is asking for is so she can increase her capital and buy groceries, noodles, Milo, etc., to prepare fast food to sell to customers. She will get the items from the supermarket and then sell them according to her customers' demand. This type of work allows her to earn money so she can support her family (she is single and has one child).\n\nWhen asked what she likes about ID-Ghana, she says that she likes the health insurance subsidy, the training, and the soft loan programs.\n\nThey will need a total amount of 2,300 GHS (Ghana cedis) to improve their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1546743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Ever since he was small, he has been working in the fields, because he learned to farm through the teachings of his parents.  He used to have a variety of crops, but due to the increasing costs of production and the falling prices of the products, he found it necessary to change his specialization.  Today he works cultivating flowers on a farm where he lives.  In addition, he partnered with a friend to grow aster flowers on another plot.  This has enabled him to generate sufficient resources to cover the basic expenses and support his wife and only child, who is 6 years old.\r\n\r\nWith the loan that he is requesting, he will buy agricultural supplies such as fertilizers, irrigation supplies, and other items.  This will allow him to continue to product excellent quality flowers so that he will be more competitive in the market.  In addition, it will help him to generate resources to carry out the paperwork and obtain the permits needed to export his products outside the country.  This will also increase the profitability of his business.\r\n\r\nWith his enterprising spirit and motivation to accomplish his goals, Joan will continue to work very hard to accomplish his dream: to have his own well-organized and structured business with all of the permits needed to take his products outside the country.

This canton is very well known for its traditions and agriculture.\r\n\r\nOlga's 44 years old and the single mother of a young son.  She finished elementary school with a lot of sacrifice and dedication.  She also got a diploma as a professional seamstress.  Her parents supported her up to that point, then she had to find a way to get ahead on her own.  Her parents taught her the art of agriculture and ranching from a young age.\r\n\r\nOlga has been very persevering on behalf of her little boy, who fills her with happiness.  She has had to strive very hard to be able to give him a better life so he'll be a great professional full of values and principles, which she has instilled in him since he was little.\r\n\r\nOlga built her house with a lot of effort, happiness, and pride when her mother left her a small piece of land.  Unfortunately Olga hasn't been able to finish building because she lacks the money.  This is why she's requesting a loan, which she saw as a way to help finish building her modest home and improve her quality of life and her son's.\r\n\r\nOlga's grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making her personal and business growth possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1545523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to finish building her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pujil\u00ed","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2014-03-14T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-13T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1108.95,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":88.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":95.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":98.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":99.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":104.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.85},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.68,"local_amount":82.49,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212349},{"amount":86.16,"local_amount":84.93,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":86.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138335},{"amount":82.66,"local_amount":81.48,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":82.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832347},{"amount":89.69,"local_amount":88.41,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":89.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258488},{"amount":89.92,"local_amount":88.64,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":89.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540841},{"amount":189.06,"local_amount":186.36,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":189.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516182},{"amount":503.83,"local_amount":496.64,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":503.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649766}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T11:08:09Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T12:10:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":682962,"name":"Mango Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salma is a businesswoman who devotes her lifetime to three projects.

She grows tea and she has done this since 1994. It was an activity she started with the hope of making enough money to cater to the needs of her family. Jovans is a mother of eleven children and ten of them are in school. The reason why she has to work hard and look for money is to see all her children through school. Tea growing is her sole source of income and she gives it much time so that she can get enough income in return. She has applied for a loan of two million shillings so that she can use it to buy fertilizers to boost the fertility of her soils, and to harvest much more and hence earn enough profits as a reward for her hard work. Her clients are mainly tea traders who later take the tea to the factories in the same area. Her dream is to see all the children through school using the meager resources. She believes that if the loan is given, she will earn enough profits since the harvests will be larger as a result of fertile soils. Her major challenge is the dry season which affects the tea and her income negatively. However, she hopes that if the loan is given she will beat the

Her customers are mainly residents of the village, and she believes that with their support she will make more sales, expand her business and be in position to cater for the needs of her family.

The economic situation during those times was very difficult.  It did not allow her to continue.  She is now married.  Her husband is a watchman for a gas company.  They have one child, and he is going to school.  Only her son is dependent upon her.\r\n\r\nAna is very hard-working.  She sells fruit and vegetables in the entire neighborhood where she lives.  She now has three years of experience.  She learned this business activity from her mother, who taught her when she was little.  At that time, she went out with her mother to sell fruit at a crossroads.  She also makes tamales for half a day, and then goes to sell them in a basket.  Her schedule for this work is from 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nShe really needs this loan to buy more vegetables like potatoes, carrots, chayote [a type of squash], tomatoes, and cucumbers.  She also wants to buy leaves to wrap the tamales.  This will help her a lot because the more she buys the more she sells.  Also, she gets better income for her household.  Her business will not be brought to a standstill due to lack of funds.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s plan for the future is to have a store in her house.  She has liked the business since she was little.  Now she has the opportunity, and she wants to take advantage of the help of the loans.  Also, she wants to succeed and to get her family ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1551667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy more vegetables like potatoes, carrots, chayote [a type of squash], tomatoes, and cucumbers.

Because of limited resources, her mother, her sister, her aunts, and even her grandmother, always fixed their own and each other's nails and hair, and Daniela likes everything that has to do with skin care and image. She has chosen this as a career and wants to learn about treatments like facials, massages, hairstyling, makeup, and many other things. \n\nDaniela lost her father when she was five, and after seeing how much her mother sacrificed in order to provide for her and her sister, she wants a better future for her family and for herself and has decided to get a cosmetology degree in order to achieve all of her goals. That is why she decided to talk about her situation and seek help through Kiva, since even though she is young she has a two-and-a-half-year-old son.

through an intermediary five years ago. They liked her work so her orders grew. Later after disengaging the intermediary she began to find her own work. Her husband helps her with negotiations. She took out a microloan from the special provincial administration for the first job she did on her own and bought two sack cloths. Her orders grew and she opened a small store with her husband. With the loan, she will buy different types and colors of fabric wholesale so she'll be able to fill orders right away. She has big plans for the future. After promotional jobs she will expand her business. She wants to move to a bigger store and hire employees to give others employment. She believes strongly that her dreams will be realized.

Thanks to Suurakan's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow and 5 sheep on her farm, as well as a 5.0 hectare plot of rented land on which she annually sows beans for personal consumption and sale. In her free time, Tolgonay additionally bakes small pies and fried dumplings which brings in a small profit. Her monthly cumulative income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Suurakan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy bean seeds for sowing and fertilizers for working the land. Suurakan is determined to receive a good harvest, which will be indispensable for increasing her family's capital.

She said she was not going to leave this field however, so she would help in another manner.\n\nShe currently requires the agreement with Kiva because as she mentioned before she only lives with her \u200b\u200bbrother and does not have a stable job right now.

","en":"Javlon was born in 1981 in the village of Spitamen region and lives there to this day.  He's a hardworking, mild-mannered young man and is married with two children.  His wife, Saodat, is a seamstress and works at a dressmaker's shop, sewing mostly curtains and Tajikistani dresses for women in the surrounding villages.  Javlon does not have a university education, but would like his children to be able to earn degrees and have jobs related to them.  He hopes his children will one day be able to earn enough to help support him.  \n\nJavlon himself works in a large marketplace in his area.  He runs a small grocery store there, and has been selling his wares there for nearly 2 years.  His business is developing at a good pace, and, bit by bit, he's attracting a number of regular customers.  He feels his easygoing personality and kindness have helped his business succeed.  As his business is doing well, he feels now is the right time to expand his offering of food items in hopes of increasing his sales.  However, he lacks the money to stock up on such goods, and, as such, decided to apply for a loan with Arvand.  He hopes it won't be long before he gets the money he needs, and would like to thank Arvand in advance for their support and for all their hard work.

She later found a creditor to provide her with funding, which has had a very positive impact on her business, allowing her to consolidate, expand her inventory, and increase her sales.\r\n\r\nWith the economic support of her husband, who covers all family expenses like healthcare and the needs of their children and grandchild, she is able to use the income she generates to repay her loan and reinvest in her business.\r\n\r\nDona Fanny lives in the community of Suiza in Turrialba.  She uses the money from her loan to sell clothing like jeans, which are her speciality, and underwear as well as perfume.  Her clientele has grown considerably and, with this, her demand.  Her goal for the near future is to have a room in her house dedicated to the sale of her clothing so that she can better serve her clients.

Sonia is a single mother; she has three children: the oldest (a daughter) is 16 years old and has finished sixth grade, the second (a son) is 14 years old and has finished second grade, and the youngest (a son) is seven years old and is in the second grade. They live as one big family and they work together in agriculture. They grow coffee and her parents live with them as well. She has been working with her coffee crops for eight years. She inherited them from her parents and they are located 500 metres away from her home. She walks there with her three children and her father.\r\n\r\nHer plans as a coffee producer are to continue investing in her coffee crops and to buy more land so she can continue growing coffee. Her dream as a mother is to see her children in better living conditions with property so that they can work, since she was not able to support them further in their studies. Ana is requesting financial support in order to purchase fertiliser, compost, and foliar fertiliser, which are necessary for maintaining her coffee crops in this season so she can have greater coffee production.

They started their business a short time ago: Ms. Refugio previously had a workshop, but unfortunately, she had to leave it because she had other activities. Her husband has always worked in taxis, so Ms. Refugio decided to invest in the fee for plates because she knows it is a good business and has good earnings. The only difficulty they face in their business is when the payment for their taxi fees is not on time. The three members are content and grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund for the authorized loan. With the loans, they will be able to achieve their dreams: to stop requesting loans from microfinancers and to be able to start a new business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1545536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy plates, spare parts, tires, etc. for cars.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san antonio Enchisi, Atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-03-14T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-13T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Refugio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"J.

She is married and her husband drives a motorcycle taxi in the municipality where they live. They have three children, two of whom are attending school, and the other child, who is not yet school-age, stays at home with her. Her children are the only ones depending on her. She is a housewife, and she takes care of their children, as her husband works during the day.  \r\n\r\nAbout a month ago, this hardworking woman opened a little store in her home, encouraged to take the initiative by the woman who owns the motorcycle taxi that her husband drives. Zochilt has noticed that the business is good, as in her neighborhood there are no other stores nearby. Therefore, she is making it easier for people to do their shopping closer to home.  Also, she is earning income for her family.  She is the only one carrying out this activity. No one else in the family is involved, as her husband does not come home from work until later, and cannot help her with the store.  Thus, between the two of them, they maintain their home. \r\n\r\nZochilt is requesting this loan in order to purchase soda pop, churros, sweets, and cookies, as they are the products that children want; but she also wants to sell basic food items such as oil, rice, beans, sugar, eggs, etc. \r\n\r\nZochilt\u2019s dreams are to continue with her business, as she has liked this occupation since she was young; and she is counting on the opportunity that the lenders are giving her.  Also, she wants to succeed, and provide for her family.  She wants to help her husband with the household expenses so that together they can give their children the opportunity to study and become great professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1551654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

","en":"Abduhayot is a cheerful and hardworking 43-year-old man. He is married and has three children. Abduhayot was a labor migrant in Russia for many years. He would live there for a long period of time in order to earn money for his family. As a result, he was able to use his earned money to build a small house for his family. He then began to look for work here in his village, but he did not find any. Then decided to start his own business. Abduhayot turned to Arvand for the first time when he realized that there was an opportunity to receive financial assistance. <br \/><br \/>In order to have earnings to live on, Abduhayot has his own business. He practices fattening up and reselling cattle. He receives a good income from this business. His wife also helps him with this business. She sells the milk obtained from the cows. Now Abduhayot wants to increase the size of his herd to expand his business. This is why he is requesting a loan from Arvand to buy cattle. Abduhayot really relies on a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their assistance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1540945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has mentioned that seasonality as her major challenge. With the Kshs 20000 loan, she wants to purchase wheat flour, rice, beans, cooking oil and charcoal for her business. She decided to join Yehu to access loans in order to boost her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1556686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
