She raised her children by herself. She has her own business selling yarn, thread, beads and needlework. Thanks to her previous KIVA loan, she was able to receive additional profits and pay for her children's education. This time, Vera hopes to take advantage of a loan to improve her living conditions. Vera plans to use a loan of 8,000 UAH to repair her kitchen - to put in a new floor, paint the walls, and change out her dishwasher and gas oven. Vera's business is going well, which is why Vera is sure that paying back the loan will not be a problem.

With this loan, Bessy hopes to improve her and her family's quality of life with a higher income coming into her household.\r\n\r\nBessy hopes in the short term to expand her business and to be able to continue supporting her family so that they may have better opportunities in life.\r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras, October 2013"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1551788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy beans, sugar, butter, rice, coffee, water, bread, milk, juices and more for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2014-03-15T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-14T19:30:09Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bessy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":203.65,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3956.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468035394},{"amount":88.54,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1720.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490949877},{"amount":44.27,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":860.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504388476},{"amount":44.27,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":860.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517665473},{"amount":44.27,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":860.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530167228}],"funded_date":"2014-03-17T18:24:06Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:02:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":683198,"name":"Florencia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florencia is a married woman with three children.

She used the previous loans to start her second hand clothes business; all of which she paid back successfully. Haika earned a profit which she used to pay part of school fees and put back to her business. With her new request, Haika will use the loan to replenish her business with new stock of clothes to resell. She dreams that one day she will be able to open another successful business.\r\n\r\nHaika will share this loan with her loan group \"Karibea\" which consist of two members.

man from the countryside. He is 36 years old and works tirelessly to support his wife and his children aged 10 and 4.\r\n\r\nHe learned all about farm work from his parents, starting at a young age. So today he has his own farm where he grows coffee, sugar cane, and fruit. The produce is sold in the local market, and with the money he earns he supports his family.\r\n\r\nBecause Tiberio wants to grow his business, he is seeking a loan to buy supplies at wholesale prices (manure, fertilizer, and insecticide). These purchases will allow him to continue caring for his crops and he will have a more productive harvest. Income will be increased when it comes time to sell the produce.\r\n\r\nWith his keen attitude and wish to improve his lot in life, Tiberio wants to continue working hard. In the near future he wants to grow crops on the whole of his land and thus increase income. He will be able to provide his children with a better education and the whole family will benefit from a better standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1551864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She has managed to give them the best or at least the best that she could manage.  She is a good friend, mother, and counselor.  Just like her, everyday thousands of women are getting their children ahead through their hard work and discipline.\r\n\r\nLike everyone, Ana also has great goals and dreams, and what she has always longed for is to have a day spa.  \r\n\r\nSaving up was not an easy task but she always kept straight that if she did it, she would be able to go on rising in search of this goal.\r\n\r\nToday she has started to take the first steps in search of this dream, because after so many years it is time to set aside time for her big hopes; her children already have their studies lined up and have begun to fly on their own.\r\n\r\nCampo Alto was the institution chosen to train her and put into action her steady plan.  In order to get to this place she needs to take two types of transportation going and two more returning.  However, in order to save money next semester, she has decided to get up much earlier than she is used to and note the time it takes to arrive on foot.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Ana is aware that she should drop a few kilograms in weight for her health, and the course of study she has chosen makes it a good idea for her to be in shape to show that what she is studying has given her good results.  Also, she will be a reflexion of what others should do, following her example.\r\n\r\nHer experience in her first class left her fascinated, because the human factors, as much as the administrative teaching, reaffirmed that it was the best choice.\r\n\r\nAna knows that the rhythm of work waiting for her won\u2019t be easy from now on, as she needs to rise at dawn and walk more than she is used to--both going and returning.  Afternoon naps will no longer be a daily part of her life, while readings and assignments will be her closest companions, not to mention all the responsibilities of being a mother and head of her household.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, Ana needs a Kiva loan.  Because she is a mother and the head of her household and her expenses are pretty high, a Kiva loan would help her to reduce her costs and save a bit more money."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1551871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one semester's registration","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-16T00:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-15T00:10:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202242},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286383},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225090}],"funded_date":"2014-03-16T02:05:46Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":682528,"name":"Sabali Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe SABALI est compos\u00e9 de femmes mari\u00e9es, elles ont en moyenne 33 ans, et 4 enfants.

She lives in a rural community, but is still a nice place. She has been working in her activity for 10 years, since she needed to work and generate income and be able to contribute a little to the home. She has a beauty salon in her house and has set up a room in the front of her house. She built it with the money from selling a car she had, although she does not neglect her family. She specialized in her work when she took courses in the National Learning Institute and also in private academies. Thanks to her hard work and dedication it is going well for her. She has good customers and they pay her upfront and on credit for products and hair care. She has her husband's support in the decisions she makes for the family and the business. This is the first time that she has asked for a loan to reinforce her business, because she needs to change the hair washing sink and the chair that she has. This way, she can improve the quality of the services she offers and thus be competitive. She will also invest in materials such as dyes, keratines, shampoos, and treatments. She can grow and improve her and her family's quality of life. She can also improve her mother's health, because she is very sick and she wants to give her everything she needs for her illness.

beautiful Caribbean island. This young woman cared so much about nature that she led various environmental projects that were organized to raise awareness among the student body about the importance of protecting and conserving natural resources. She was such a leader that once she graduated from high school, a chemistry professor recommended her to work as a contractor as a social promoter of environmental projects.\r\n\r\nFour years later, this young woman decided to enlist as a volunteer in the Colombian Civil Defense (a humanitarian group). There she hoped to follow her dreams that had been outlined, \"conserving nature and teaching communities to protect it,\" from the natural phenomenon that the island generated. \r\n  \r\nLina started out as a candidate for the Civil Defense, advanced in the trainings that were required to join the institution. Nevertheless, after three months, she had the opportunity to join the Colombian Civil Defense as a state employee. She worked as a secretary and was earning $400.00 a month.  \r\n\r\nNow, she is studying business administration and wants to have more experience in order to be able to continue working in the Civil Defense, which is what interests her. However, for that she needs a loan from Kiva because her monthly expenses have increased and she does not have all the money she needs to pay her monthly expenses. She would be very grateful for a loan from Kiva to help her continue her studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1551888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one semester's tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-16T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-15T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202243},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286384},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225091}],"funded_date":"2014-03-16T03:31:18Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":683348,"name":"Al-Wala'a** Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Al-Wala'a** is a four-member group from Sana'a, Yemen.

Janet is married to a police man. They have three children aged 5 to 17 years. \r\nJanet first started her business in 2002 to help educate her children and is proud that all three of her children are still at school. Janet sells raw cashew nuts to customers. Cashews are grown in Sierra Leone. The cashew are then roasted by her customers and eaten (or sold on) as snacks. Janet works hard six days a week and has developed her business so that she can now employ an assistant to help her. \r\nShe would like this loan to increase her capital so that she can buy more bags of raw cashews. Janet is grateful that her family is doing well and dreams that all her children will finish school with a good education. She thanks you for your support.

She is a 59 years old widow and a mother of 7 children. Her husband passed away several years ago. She depends entirely in her husband salary and the rent of her apartment since she is uneducated and can't work. She loves her children very much and tries to provide her children with a good education and living conditions. Some appliances in her house are very old and need maintenance from time to time. Kramah decided to purchase new home appliances instead of wasting money for maintenance and buy some furniture, but she doesn't have enough money for all of that, Thus she has requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 YER from AMB. Kramah hopes that she will be able to finish purchasing new home appliances and improve her family's living

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result for better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nLida hopes that her business will last longer and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance

De modo tal que en pocos a\u00f1os se vea en una empresa reconocida que apoye el talento humano y las capacidades de cada colaborador, una empresa donde pueda hacer uso provechoso de todo lo que aprenda en Campo alto, y desde luego una que aporte a la calidad de vida. \n","en":"She is Clara Ines from Bogot\u00e1.  In the first place, she feels that life is full of challenges, which comprise each human being\u2019s own character.  Achieving goals, following dreams, and overcoming obstacles are indispensable elements that determine identity.\r\n\r\nBased on that, she feels that studying is a very important challenge for her in so far as it is one more factor involved in improving her quality of life and that of her family.  CampoAlto is, without a doubt, an institution where the opportunity to do so is found without leaving behind the life she has led so far.\r\n\r\nThe thing that especially catches her attention is the flexibility of the schedules.  This is because she is able to work at the same time.  The good financing, which Kiva is a part of, also catches her attention.  This makes financial stability much easier, allowing her to not withdraw at some point due to the lack of money.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, she feels that it is a very good, well-known institution of high academic quality.  This will bring about a comprehensive formation in the career that she has chosen.  She has chosen the career of being an assistant in health administration, which contributes good benefits to the educational process.  In a few years she sees herself at a well-known company that supports human talent and the capabilities of each employee.  It is a company where she will be able to beneficially use everything that she will learn at CampoAlto.  It will certainly contribute to her quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1551911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay tuition for a semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-16T14:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-15T14:10:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202244},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286385},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225092}],"funded_date":"2014-03-16T16:24:32Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":682686,"name":"Fotemogoban Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe FOTEMOGOBAN est compos\u00e9 de femmes mari\u00e9es, elles ont en moyenne 35 ans, et 3 enfants.

las sumas y restas  vio que los hijos necesitaban m\u00e1s cosas para el colegio y ese a\u00f1o decidi\u00f3 no estudiar ella  pens\u00f3 primero en el estudio de ellos los hijos, en el transcurso de los d\u00edas conoci\u00f3 personas, ellos  hablaban de las clases y como hab\u00edan facilidades de pago. \nEste a\u00f1o vio la oportunidad y ella decide estudiar  esta carrera, a ella le gustar\u00eda trabajar en un futuro en los hospitales ya que ella tiene facilidad para entrar a un hospital y trabajar y  vio que en la salud necesitan gente con buen servicio, humildad, una mano amiga ya que en esos momentos es cuando ellos necesitan de la ayuda de los dem\u00e1s tiene que mirar desde muy adentro del  ser que ellos son personas enfermas con necesidades y dificultades y no cuentan con los recursos suficientes. \nCarolina  para poder lograr esto necesita prepararse, estudiar seguir con los contactos en la rama de la salud, para tener mejores propuestas de trabajo en los hospitales y cl\u00ednicas y seguir adelante con los hijos y poderles brindar  universidad ya que sin un titulo es muy dif\u00edcil conseguir un trabajo bueno.\nElla agradece  a convenio KIVA para que ellos la tengan en cuenta, ella necesita de la colaboraci\u00f3n y cumplir una meta importante para la vida personal, ya que desde muchos a\u00f1os esto es un sue\u00f1o y ella lo quiere cumplir

She wanted a better future, but unfortunately she did not have enough money nor anyone's support. One day she decided she wanted to study nonetheless. She added up her expenses, but when calculating these, she noticed that her children needed more things for school and decided not to start her studies that year. However, she later met people who told her about the courses they were taking and how there were different payment schemes available. That year she saw the opportunity and decided to go to college.\r\n\r\nShe would like to work in a hospital. She has seen that in the health sector they need people that provide good service, that are humble and give a friendly hand, since in tough situations people need the help from others. She feels for the sick, who have needs, difficulties and do not have enough economic resources.\r\n\r\nTo realise her dream, Carolina needs to prepare herself, to keep studying, and to keep her contacts in the health sector. This will allow her to have better job opportunities in hospitals and clinics, to get her children ahead, and to allow them to go to the university since it is very difficult to get a good job without a degree.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva for taking her into account. She needs the collaboration of Kiva lenders in order to achieve an important goal in her personal life. She has had this dream for many years, to study health administration."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1551935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester's tuition fee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-16T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-15T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202245},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286386},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":151875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225093}],"funded_date":"2014-03-16T16:24:32Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ken Arroyo Ohori","image":1171159}},{"id":683612,"name":"Sreyoun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a rural area located in Kandal province\u2019s Kandal Stoeng district, Sreyoun, 30, has a total of two children, one of whom is in school while another one is too young for school.

This is 32 year old Joseph from Masvingo. He is married with three children, only one of which attends school. He also cares for one other dependent. Joseph runs a fashion boutique business selling clothes, shoes and handbags. The business has been in operation for 6 years.

She lives in the Nyamira area of Nyanza Kenya, which is a primary banana producing area. Ruth loves farming and, more especially, crop farming.

Marina's husband is a very clever and hardworking person who works and does everything to provide his young family with good living conditions. He distributes meat from villages to city supermarkets. As Marina says, his work is very tense and hard since he is always in a hurry and drives long distances in order to bring good, healthy and fresh meat on time to the shops that give him orders. \r\n\r\nMarina decided to help her husband and she passed courses for doing makeup and manicures. For the first period while their child is small, Marina plans to work at home. She already has many loyal customers, but she has a lack of good, high quality tools and makeup and manicure materials. Marina is asking for a loan in order to buy makeup materials and tools. She greatly hopes that this loan will help her to develop her start-up business and help her husband to solve their family's financial

She lives with her husband and three children. Her husband is a private worker who brings firewood from the forest and sells it. This activity is seasonal, and he earns a small income that is hardly enough for meeting their basic needs, especially since they have three children. The family belongs to the subsistence poor category, as they have no significant source of income and live under the poverty line. Because of the above-mentioned situation, Maia is not able to receive credit from the local financial providers for starting business.  \r\n\r\nMaia's request has now been approved within the framework of Kiva and Credo, so she is able to use this startup loan for starting a business trading in  used clothing. The loan of 300 USD will help her to purchase a stock of goods which she would sell from her house among the villagers. Maia thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is the only business of this kind in the area.
