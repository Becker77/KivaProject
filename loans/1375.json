Sales are made to a mixed customer base paying with cash and often on credit. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Seli Madou hopes to make an average monthly profit of 7,500 francs CFA that will be used for the various needs of her children and for increasing her capital. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1556412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase millet to make galettes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Chiola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-03-16T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-15T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djelika                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokiatou               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou        K  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seli      Madou                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":43246.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263875},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T09:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":43246.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263876},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":43246.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960753},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":43246.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677113},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":43246.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676769},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:34:14Z","rounded_local_amount":43246.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209278}],"funded_date":"2014-03-17T10:54:47Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:34:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":683865,"name":"Naira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This nice and bright lady named Naira is 34 years old and she lives in Dilijan city.\r\n\r\nNaira has graduated from Dilijan city's music college, but for many years she did not work in her specialty despite wanting to very much.

Our grandmothers used to do this on weekends, and they occupied the whole house for this activity; they then spread linens on every corner of the house to put the \u2018trahana\u2019 to dry. As kids we loved this funny and messy activity.

She is pictured with her mother standing on the left side. She is 26 years old from Imphal, Manipur in the northeastern region of India. She has six siblings. Her mother is a housewife and her father runs a chemist store in their locality. The family\u2019s only income generating source is through this store. Themneikim has aspired to become an airline cabin crew member since she was young. As she loves traveling, being paid to travel is one of the job\u2019s biggest perks. It allows one to see the world and make money at the same time. \r\n\r\nDue to her family\u2019s poor economic condition, she could not even consider thinking of enrolling in such a reputable and expensive profession. Therefore, she changed her mind and pursued a less expensive career in nursing after she completed pre secondary education. However, after acquiring her G.N.M (General Nursing Midwifery) degree too, she didn't stop aspiring to pursue her dream career. And as luck would have it, she was selected in a cabin crew interview that was conducted in Imphal. Though she has cleared the interview, her joy was incomplete because she has to pay a security deposit to undergo the training. This is a huge amount of money that is beyond her family\u2019s capacity. \r\n\r\nSince her parents cannot afford to provide such a huge amount, Themneikim sought help from her friends who are also members of Kiva and they told her about Kiva's help for those who need financial support in terms of a loan. She thanks Kiva for helping in times of need and making her dream career come true.  In the future, Themneikim says that she wants to keep her parents free from financial worries, help her siblings get a better education and help the poor and needy people by setting her own private old age home and orphanage.

This group of entrepreneurs is made up of eight women and is run by a board of directors, of which Salome is president. The group members work in various trades, including: running a convenience store, selling clothing, running a bakery, selling jewelry, sewing and weaving blankets, etc.\r\n\r\nThe funds from this loan will be put toward the business endeavors of all the group members, including Salome's business. Salome joined Pro Mujer two years ago at the invitation of a friend who is also a member. Salome currently runs a convenience store in her neighborhood, a business she learned by observing a couple of her neighbors in their business endeavors. She eventually decided to pull together what savings she could to open her own store.\r\n\r\nWith the support from this loan, Salome plans to purchase beer in bulk to stock her convenience store. She buys products for her store from wholesale distributors in El Alto and then sells them at her store. This business is her primary source of income for providing for her family, which includes her husband and two children. When asked what she likes about being a member of Pro Mujer, Salome answered that she likes the flexible credit plans, the training she receives and the health services that Pro Mujer offers as well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1535417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Currently, she has a business, weaving and selling woolens. She works at home. She started this trade four years ago, learning her technique in workshop classes. In the beginning, it was like a hobby and later, she decided to treat it as a business, besides her study. The youth loan she is currently taking out is to buy a sewing machine, which will improve her work, making it faster and increasing quality. She sells her products in shops and directly to her customers. This allows her to generate income to support her family.

","en":"Nazokat is a skillful weaver from the B. Gafurova region of the city of Khujand. She is 58 and lives with her son and his wife and her two beloved grandchildren. Nazokat has been making khan-atlas, a colourful regional type of satin fabric made from silk, for 22 years. She treats the threads taken from the silkworm cocoons, hand-dyes them into various colours, prepares the silk warp, or foundation of the fabric, and weaves the satin on the loom. In Nazokat's words, a weaver's work is labour-intensive and painstaking and requires good taste and patience. Despite this, however, she loves her work. After all, khan-atlas is a national pride of Tajiks and dresses made from it are a necessary element of every Tajik woman's wardrobe. Therefore, Nazokat's work is always in demand. She constantly has orders for fabric. Now, in order to fulfill the queue of orders, she needs to purchase thread. With this goal Nazokat is requesting a loan and hopes very much for support.

successfully finished their first nine-month business cycle.  The original ten women of this group started working with Namaste in 2013.  During this cycle they had classes in handling their money, and also advice from a business advisor in developing and implementing a business plan.  In addition to teaching them how to keep their income and expenses in a notebook, their classes helped them learn to manage their money. One of the tricks they learned for handling their cash savings was to keep the money in a narrow necked bleach bottle. That simple idea made it easier to put the cash in than to take it out and helped them increase their savings. \nOut of the original group five women have chosen to go on working with Namaste for a second business cycle.  All five of these group members have businesses related to the sale of food items. \nAna Maria (second from left) is an outstanding member of this continuing group.  She is sixty years old with a primary school education.  She is head of a household that includes an adult daughter and a four year-old grandchild.   Her business is selling tortillas and also selling items from a catalog. During the first cycle she successfully applied what she learned in the business classes and from the advice of her business advisor. She paid back her loan and her profits rose from 1364 Guatemalan Quetzales per month at the beginning of the cycle to 2120 Guatemalan Quetzales at the end of the nine-month cycle, an increase of 55%. \nHer goal for the next nine-months is to diversify her inventory without compromising the success of her original business selling handmade tortillas.  She is also planning to increase her tortilla sales. To help her in this Ana Maria is looking forward to the additional classes and business advice she will receive during this next cycle.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1557860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Right after graduating from secondary school, Ziyoda got married and became a homemaker. However, even though she is always at home, she is never without something to do. She and her husband strive to do all that they can to provide their children with all of the necessities. <br \/><br \/>In order to have a steady income to live on, Ziyoda and her husband started their own business. They practice livestock breeding. They raise cattle, then sell the milk and meat that they get from them. Ziyoda receives a good income from this business. Ziyoda's husband also helps her run this business. He does the more labor-intensive tasks. Their income is enough for an average standard of living. But now, they do not have enough money to cover all of their present needs. Currently, Ziyoda and her husband want to buy more cattle to fatten them up. This is why she is requesting a loan from Arvand to buy cattle.

45-year-old woman. She is married and has three children. Muhtaram lives with her family in a small country village. Her husband and son work abroad in Russia. Muhtaram and her other children have their own business to make a steady income to live on. <br \/><br \/>Muhtaram is a very hardworking woman. She really loves her family and does all that she can so that her children want for nothing. Muhtaram practices livestock breeding. She has worked with Arvand since 2012 and is a responsible customer of their services. She received her first loan to buy her first cow for fattening up.

She is a responsible mother. Her children like her a lot due to her caring nature. Suriya has owned a dairy farm at her home since 1995. She produces milk with the help of her husband and sons. She is growing old and does not have enough energy to perform her tasks as she used to do when she was younger. \r\n\r\nA few days ago one of her cattle was stolen due to lack of security and because there is no proper shelter for her cattle. This needs to be improved. She wants to buy a buffalo and maintain a cowshed but she has insufficient savings. Therefore, Suriya has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner\u2019s BRAC Pakistan, so that she can overcome these deficiencies and carry on her business smoothly. \r\n\r\nFrom the profit amount, Suriya will ensure the security for her cattle and build a shelter to avoid theft in the future. Suriya is very thankful to Kiva and  BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1559821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Zamirbek has a secondary education. As the main source of income for his family, Zamirbek practices livestock breeding and crop farming. He started this business 14 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zamibek's hard work, he currently has 6 milk cows, 1 calf and 5 sheep on his farm, as well as a 1.83 hectare plot of land on which he grows watermelons, cucumbers and vegetables. His monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing his business, Zamirbek turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" He is requesting a loan to buy high quality watermelon, cucumber and vegetable seeds for sowing as well as fertilizers for cultivating the land. Zamirbek is determined to receive a good harvest which will fundamentally increase his family's capital. Zamirbek plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

This is Joseph. He is the head teacher of Kitala Secondary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Kisubi in Wakiso with 1,200 students. Kitala Secondary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining an Ultrafiltration water treatment system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase an ultrafiltration water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nKitala will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank. Joseph ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1010,"image":{"id":1546848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

Meanchey province\u2019s Moung Russey district. She and her husband earn a living through farming rice, which they have been doing for 12 years. To add more income, she has been working as a paid worker. The current business earns them about 50,000 KHR per day and manages to save about 31,000 KHR each day for their future needs.\r\n \r\nVoern\u2019s group consists of two female members who live in the same village.

She started this business 20 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulaiym's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 6 goats on her farm, as well as a 0.78 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows peppers, tomatoes, and cotton for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulaiym turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy high quality pepper, tomato, and cotton seeds for sowing as well as fertilizers for cultivating the land. Gulaiym is determined to receive a good harvest which will fundamentally increase her family's capital. Gulaiym plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

He is not yet married and lives with his parents. He is a very hard-working person, and for over eight years he has been working as a foreman in a furniture factory. He receives a modes salary at that job. However, Abdusattor plans to get married soon, and so he needs to save up for his wedding. This is why he decided to take on additional work.\r\n\r\nIn order to have sufficient income for supporting himself, he does the work he enjoys most. He works as a taxi driver on the side. In the evening he gets in his car and provides taxi services. He has his own car for this purpose. But he has been driving this car for a long time, and had to repair it many times. This is why at present he would like to buy a different, better car in order to develop and grow his business. And, in order to buy a new car, he needs financial means. This is why Abdusattor has applied to Arvand for a loan to buy a car for his business. He is hoping for a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for its

He is married to Reynaldo, an employee, and mother to his children. Together with his wife, Timoteo manages the household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTimoteo operates a cell phone retailing business. His business works as follows: he buys cell phone units from a supplier and then sells them for a small profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options he offers. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000. He will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stocks of mobile and cell phone units to expand his product inventory.\r\n\r\nTimoteo hopes to be able to expand his business in the coming years. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
