In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for each item in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\n\nWilma is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\n\nWilma dreams that her business will continue to expand and she hopes to have a better living. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\n\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Baktygul is 36 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising four children. Baktygul has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 10 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Baktygul's hard work, she currently has 5 milk cows on her farm, as well as a 1.30 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows cucumbers, tomatoes, and melons for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly cumulative income is 10,000 som (KGS).

She started this business 19 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Khadiyakhon's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow on her farm as well as a 0.45 hectare plot of land on which she mainly grows cotton. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Khadiyakhon turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. After purchasing the cattle, they will be located on her farm. In the summer, they will be under the care of a shepherd. Khadiyakhon plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

It is a productive and commercial area.  Juana is known for being an enterprising woman with a great desire for self-improvement.  In the commercial arena, Juana is a small, micro-entrepreneur of a small business (a general store) where she sells basic household goods such as: rice, sugar, detergents, beans, frozen goods, sweets, sodas, cosmetics, eggs, toilet paper, firewood and other items.  She makes her purchases from the markets and distributors that deliver to her home.  She pays cash for those purchases.  Juana has both regular customers and walk-in customers at her store.  She starts work early in the morning each day to be able to offer better service to her customers.  Thanks to her good customer service and the quality of the products that she offers for sale, her customers' requests have increased.  And so, Juana once again is requesting a loan to invest in working capital to use to stock up her store even more.  In this way, Juana will be able to offer better service to her customers.  She is very grateful for the help that the Kiva investors offer to low-income people.

The area is known for being very commercial, its traditional festivals of San Pedro and San Pablo and for the joy of its people.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a founding member of the Credit Group and she enjoys it because of the help that the loans provide to get ahead in her business and improve her economic situation. She is 66 years old and many years ago her husband passed away. Together she and her husband had five children who are all grown up. One daughter still lives with her even though she is married.\r\n\r\nCarmen with the intention of gaining her own income and therefore the ability to improve her household, she sells all types of clothing. She sells the clothes door to door and also from her house where she has a small shop. She works every day, allows her customers to pay with credit and collects every fifteen days.

The economic insecurity has made one of her sons to drop out of school and join his father as a construction worker. She wants to keep her other two children in school and for that Shantavva needs to expand her business.\r\n\r\nShantavva now seeks a loan to purchase six more sheep and push her rearing business to a stronger production stage. The other members of the group also want to have more sheep so that their annual production of the cattle increase, which will bring more profits. All other group members want to buy at least 3 lambs each. Each has potential to earn 18,000 INR within a cycle of seven months."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1553968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade","Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy lambs for rearing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bagalkot, Karnataka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.183333 75.7","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-03-18T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-17T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shantavva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rangavva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Renavva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Renavva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chennavva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T18:57:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":682302,"name":"Greens Shivalingeshwara Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The villages of North Karnataka in Bagalkot always face shortages of water.

Tamar works as an expert assessor at a private company and has a fixed salary.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her monthly income and get an additional source of income for her family, Tamar decided to open a mini-store. She requested a loan and was approved under the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo; the start up program that enables people to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nWith the requested money, she will purchase stocks of soft drinks, chewing gum, and other mixed goods for her store, and will also arrange the place with all the needed parts. The income from this new business will greatly help Tamar make savings, and more effectively meet all daily costs. She will be really grateful for helping her maintain her private activity.

This region is renowned for its agriculture, since a large portion of its inhabitants are employed in the sowing of short-term crops. This is where B\u00e9lgica lives, a 34 year old woman who cohabitates with her partner with whom she has three children of 10, 12, and 14 years of age who are currently attending school. Her spouse works in a car repair shop. Ms. B\u00e9lgica works in sales of all types of clothing with the purpose of making her own money and helping her partner with household expenses. She sells door-to-door, although the majority of her sales are orders made by her customers. Once a month she travels to Guayaquil to purchase the items ordered by her customers and also brings additional merchandise to offer throughout the city.

Right after she completed her pre secondary, with her parents' consent, she went to take the cabin crew interview, which was conducted in town during that time. But unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t get through during that time. However, she never gave up her dreams and kept persisting until she reached her goal. With her never-give-up attitude, she achieved her dreams successfully today.  \r\n\r\nShe is so thankful to her parents because in spite of their difficulties, limited income and other responsibilities of the family; they made an effort to send her to a good school and let her pursue her dreams. Joycee says that being the eldest in the family, she has lot of responsibilities on her shoulder and it is time to help her parents. She wishes to help her parents by supporting them financially in looking after her younger siblings. There is no other source of income apart from her father\u2019s monthly salary, which is just sufficient to run the family's affairs. \r\n\r\nShe needs money to enroll in cabin crew training. However, due to financial crunches, her parents could not enthusiastically send her off. Through her common friends, she learned about Kiva who provides financial help to the potential and deserving professional who need financial support to nurture her dreams. She thanks Kiva for being such a great help in times of need and for their generosity towards her and the family.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nBweyogerere high will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank. Abraham ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":590,"image":{"id":1550353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

She works from her home, so she does not have a set work schedule since her work depends on the time that her customers are available.\r\n\r\nDespite the obstacles that exist, she continues to be motivated to do her job and move her children forward. This is why she is requesting a loan, which she will use to purchase supplies in bulk (nail polish, acrylics, nail files, etc.) and pay off the balance of an outstanding loan. This will allow her to continue to provide good service to her customers and generate more income. \r\n\r\nLeidy tells us that her greatest desire is to have a stable, prosperous business that will

This will ensure that his children's school fees are well taken care of."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1560383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase animal feeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-03-18T14:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-17T14:10:07Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1017.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1019.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1053.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1075.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1109.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1164.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1198.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1228.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T14:55:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":684574,"name":"Mbeyu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mbeyu appreciates her previous Kiva loan that improved her living standards.\r\n\r\nBesides the poultry business, Mbeyu practices a fruits and vegetable selling business.

and operates a hotel in Ololailumtia, a rural village almost 100km and a least a three hour drive from Kenya national grid power. The village sits on the edge of the Masai Mara and serves as a commercial hub for both the Masai residents who live in the town and for those in surrounding smaller villages. A weekly market attracts pastoralists from all over the region. Without access to electricity, the village must rely on generators, kerosene, and candles for their energy needs.  Edward takes pride in providing his customers with a clean, safe place to stay, but he could provide even better service with access to power.\n\nEdward presently operates a diesel generator to power lights in his customers\u2019 rooms. He only runs the generator for a few hours each evening and asks customers to either pay for generator fuel or use kerosene lanterns if they would like additional light. Customers sometimes complain and shorten their stay because of the lack of power. To provide more light, Edward would need to raise room charges to cover the fuel costs, which would scare away customers. Furthermore, the generator is unreliable and breaks often. To be repaired, it must be taken over three hours to the nearest large town. This takes Edward away from his business for over a day and causes him to lose a lot of income.\n\nThe solar micro-grid will provide Edward a constant and reliable power source to use for lighting and other energy services, such as phone charging and small TVs to attract more customers to his hotel. Edward will pre-pay for electricity in small bundles using his mobile phone. The solar system will require very little maintenance and a large battery bank ensures there will be plenty of power even on cloudy days. Edward will spend a lot less money for the micro-grid power than he was on diesel fuel and the frequent generator maintenance trips. He can then reinvest this money in his hotel or use it to pay school fees for his children. Furthermore, the solar system is far better for the environment and Edward\u2019s health than the noisy, polluting diesel generator.\n\nAside from Edward, three other business owners in the village are also a part of the loan connecting to the grid: Patricia, Isaac, and John. They are all looking forward to having reliable power at an affordable rate which they will also use to grow their businesses.  The micro-grid, will thus, spur economic activity in Ololailumtia and provide better and cheaper options for more residents to use energy to improve their lives.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2222.57,"image":{"id":1558872,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2944,"youtubeId":"1IoDVqTotag","title":"Kiva Borrower Edward from Kenya","thumbnailImageId":1558872},"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to connect to the solar micro-grid installed in Ololailumtia.

Sales are made to a mixed customer base paying with cash and often on credit. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Hawa hopes to make an average monthly profit of 16,000 francs CFA that will be used to cover her children's schooling costs and to increase her capital. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1556376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bounou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-03-18T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-17T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ba Yah  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maman  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":84528.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263873},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T09:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":84528.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263874},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84528.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960752},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":84528.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677112},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84528.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676768},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84528.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209277}],"funded_date":"2014-03-18T17:01:14Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:34:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":684604,"name":"Saumu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saaumu is a married woman with three children, all of whom attend school.

There he grows green squash in the winter for the family's consumption.  He also cares for a team of oxen and a cow.  What is most difficult for him is to buy agricultural supplies.  Transportation is an obstacle, as he must wait for cars to pass so that he can go out in the main road.  Otherwise, he must walk about 3 kilometers on a dusty street to get to the bus stop.  \r\n\r\nVirgilio is requesting this loan from Credicampo because he needs to buy 600 pounds of fertilizers and some herbicides.  This will be the basis for the next harvest that will assure him the grains for his family's consumption and to feed his animals.\r\n\r\nVirgilio's dreams for the future are to improve his house and help his children build their own homes in case they decide to get married.  This loan will serve as working capital for his crops, and will give him the opportunity to buy his supplies at a lower cost.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1554709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

With the goal of improving their living conditions her life companion felt obligated to emigrate to another country a few years ago, given that the income he made in their community did not cover the household expenses. Dominga took charge of the household and also contributes to the household finances. Dominga has been selling tortillas for more than 4 years. This business is very important since her daughters want a lot and what she receives from her life companion is not enough to pay for all of the necessities. \r\n\r\nAs any visionary woman would, Dominga wants to improve their living conditions by installing electricity something she has not done due to economic conditions. With the arrival of FUSAI to her community it is possible for Dominga to achieve her dream as she can get a loan that the traditional financial system would not consider. So she has requested a loan from FUSAI to pay to connect to the electrical grid, something that has been missing in the development of her

As a source of additional income for her family, Jazgul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 14 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Jazgul's hard work, she currently has 3 milk cows, 1 horse, 5 goats and 10 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Jazgul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy a horse to increase the size of her herd.

Nurzada has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 7 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nurzada's hard work, today her business contains 40 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Nurzada requested a loan from the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" to buy sheep for fattening up and subsequent resale at a market at a higher price.

As the main source of income for her family, Torokan practices animal husbandry. She started this business 30 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Torokan's hard work, she currently has 4 milk cows and 16 goats on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Torokan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd.
