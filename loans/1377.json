Both father and sister are earning a total monthly income Php 6,000.00 ($133) that is barely enough to provide their basic needs. \n\nBeing the youngest child and living in poverty motivate R-Jay to find means to help his parents have more income.

This is his story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Allan and I have received two loans from Kiva. Now, I am requesting my third loan. First off, I would like to thank the lenders who have enabled me to grow my business. A great motivation of mine is to create a life filled with opportunities. This is what keeps me strong and focused in all that I do.  \r\n\r\nThe previous loans I received through Kiva helped me grow my business. Prior to getting a loan I had one Zoona outlet, now I have three outlets and plan to open two more. My business has been positively impacted by the ability to increase my working capital through loans.  \r\n\r\nWith the first loan I managed to open two additional shops and help my community build a bus stop shelter. The loans have also had a positive impact on my family. I have managed to send my brother and two cousins to school. In November of this year I am having my wedding as well. These loans have been a true blessing. My desire is to create a better life for my family, to be a role model for them, and to allow them to see the opportunity that comes from hard work. I will use this third loan to expand my businesses by adding more working capital to my shops, which will provide me with additional income. This will also improve service to customers and my community.

As the main source of income for her family, Jumagul practices livestock breeding. She started this business 6 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Jumagul's hard work, she currently has 8 milk cows, 1 horse, and 22 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Jumagul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Jumagul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for her children's future

They are married women who live with their husbands and children in nuclear families. They are, on average, 32 years old and have two children. These three women live in the same neighborhood near one another and are friends. The women sell secondhand clothing, fish (tilapia), cooking pots, slippers and coal pots. In order to increase their working capital, the group has decided to work with the field partner ID Ghana. This will be their second group loan.\n\nErnerstina (standing in the middle of the photo) is well known for cooking pots, slippers and coal pots. She will buy cooking pots, slippers and coal pots from Accra with her loan. She will then sell the items at her residence. Ernestina hopes to earn good monthly profit, and this will be reinvested into her business and used to provide for the smaller expenses of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1558704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

","en":"Nurash is 65 years old, a widow, and after the death of her husband, raised four children alone. Nurash has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Nurash practices livestock breeding. She started this business 41 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nurash's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows on her farm. Her monthly income is 17,000 som (KGS).

She also takes care of additional family members - her grandchildren. Juliet has a pub business and has been in this business for six years. She generates additional income from selling produce. Juliet works at the market seven days out of every week and sells on a wholesale basis. Her major business challenges include transportation and seasonality.\r\n\r\nJuliet has applied for a loan of 900,000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more crates of beer, crates of soda, and cartons of mineral water and other spirits.

He is married and has five children. Abdugani does not have a higher education. From a young age, he has been practicing his business. He has an uncommon job. He slaughters cattle and sells the meat. He has run this business for many years already and he makes good earnings from it. <br \/><br \/>Abdugani sells beef and mutton at the bazaar. He rents a butcher's stall for this purpose. He also sells beef and mutton fat as well as the hides from the slaughtered cattle which can be processed into leather. Every week, Abdugani buys cattle to slaughter and sell their meat. He has his own loyal customers - people buy his meat for personal consumption as well as for dining halls to use for cooking dishes. Now Abdugani must buy several cattle for slaughter and future sale. However, he does not have enough money as he spent all of his savings on his son's wedding. This is why Abdugani is requesting a loan from Arvand to buy cattle for slaughter. He relies on a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1560337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

He is married and has two children. He has a close-knit family. They live in the countryside. In order to have an income for his family, he works quite a lot. Husniddin works as a teacher as a local school.  In his day, he was able to get a higher education. He receives a small salary from this job. In order to have enough money to make a good living, he also has his own business. Husniddin's primary, stable business is cattle raising. <br \/><br \/>Husniddin raises and sells cattle. His wife helps him with this business. She looks after the cattle and also sells the milk obtained from them. The cattle raising business brings Husniddin a good, stable income.

She and her husband have three children. Lena has received medical training and works as a physician\u2019s assistant. By nature Lena is very responsible, outgoing, and optimistic. Together with her husband, Lena raises livestock and grows produce, having launched this business 30 years ago by buying livestock for 700 KGS. Thanks to Lena\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes two dairy cows, two mares, and 10 sheep. Her monthly income from selling milk is 11,000 KGS. Lena also works 5.29 ha [13 acres] of land, where she mainly grows grains and sainfoin [a perennial herb used for forage]. She and her husband sell their harvest to wholesale dealers. In order to develop her farm further, Lena has turned to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan to buy cattle so as to increase her livestock headcount.

Denis started this business because of his experience.  He has acquired this loan to boost his matoke(banana) business by allowing him to purchase the bananas at the plantation at a lower cost compared to buying bananas already on the market.\r\n\r\nHe has hopes of expanding into a larger business which would supply more people around his area.

Manuela is originally from Carazo, a place that is located in the northern region.  She is known for being hardworking, responsible, and having the drive to succeed on a personal level.

Para ello los hermanos mayores se han establecido ya hace unos a\u00f1os, y tienen una vida digna como cualquier persona y con muchos sacrificios se les ha dado la oportunidad de ayudarlo, d\u00e1ndole estad\u00eda y brind\u00e1ndole quiz\u00e1s la \u00fanica oportunidad para estudiar una carrera profesional, ahora el est\u00e1 establecido en la casa de uno de los hermanos. \nLas metas para cuando termine de estudiar es poder conseguir trabajo para ayudarle a los padres, ya que por la edad ellos no est\u00e1n en condiciones para ejercer ning\u00fan trabajo. Tambi\u00e9n  tiene en  mente regresar al pueblo natal y crear el propio negocio para que este pueblo no sufra por la falta de personal t\u00e9cnico para la reparaci\u00f3n de equipos de computo.\nEl se entero del convenio de kiva y le pareci\u00f3 un modo mas f\u00e1cil para hacer el pago de las cuotas ya el que valor de las mensualidades le disminuyen y para el pagarlo es  mas f\u00e1cil por los aspectos que menciona anteriormente, el estar\u00eda mas entusiasmado en terminar el programa sabiendo que kiva le puede dar una ayuda para poder terminar el semestre.","en":"This is the story of Juan David, who was born in a town where the socioeconomic level isn't very high. He is the youngest son of a family of five with humble social circumstances. His parents were literally raised in the fields, with an income lower than the minimum wage. <br \/><br \/>Since he was very young, Juan David has been passionate about everything that has to do with taking apart electronic objects. He used to do this with his toys, looking to put their parts onto other objects. At times he tried to put them together again, but it was impossible because the parts didn't fit and he didn't have the necessary tools to do it.<br \/><br \/>When he started high school, one of his best grades was in the area of technology and IT (Information Technology). In group tasks, he took the initiative for the technological projects and later developed them with his classmates. He belonged to the Biological Sciences club, and one of the projects that they undertook was to make hair gel and louse shampoo. When he started eleventh grade, he stood out in his IT class because of his good grades.<br \/><br \/> During those high school years, Juan belonged to youth groups such as the Town Music Band. He also had a position in church as an altar boy. Some years later, he was the parish sacristan; with the money he received for his services, he helped his parents with some household necessities.<br \/><br \/>After having finished his high school studies, he was looking for free higher education, but he couldn't find an institution that offered this service. Because of this, he had to move to the city to pursue his goals. His older siblings have been settled down for several years now, and they have decent lives like anyone else. With many sacrifices, they have an opportunity to help him, giving him a place to stay and offering him perhaps his only opportunity to study for a professional career. He is now living in one of his brother's houses. <br \/><br \/>His goal for when he finishes school is to be able to obtain work to help out his parents, as due to their age,  they are no longer in condition to do any work. He is also thinking of returning to the town where he was born and starting his own business so that the town will not suffer due to a lack of computer repair personnel. <br \/><br \/>He found out about the Kiva program, and it seemed to him to be the easiest way of paying for his loans, because the amount of the monthly payments will be less and because making the payments is easier for the aforementioned reasons. He would be more enthusiastic about finishing the program, knowing that Kiva can give him some assistance to be able to complete the semester."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1555056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of enrollment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-19T05:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-18T05:10:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":153374.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202248},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":153374.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286389},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":153374.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225096}],"funded_date":"2014-03-19T05:22:32Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Hedel","image":971490}},{"id":684924,"name":"Teothelma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teothelma is 53 years old, married and a resident of Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte, Mindanao, Philippines.

is a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. She is 42 years old and is happily married to Melchor who works abroad as an engineer. God has blessed them with five loving children, all of whom are still studying. Life indeed is hard. But by the grace of God, they have been able to raise their children well and are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nLorna owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community: the store is connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap,  five PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg, etc. She buys her products from a wholesaler at a lower price; then she sells it per piece for a higher price to earn profit. She also sells frozen foods. For additional income, Lorna has a rental apartment. Her regular customers are her neighbours, passersby and people in the community. She has a daily minimum income of 900 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo expand her inventory, Lorna is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her in adding more products to her store.\r\n\r\nLorna hopes to expand her business and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n

She gets her supplies in Dangassa and locally from the wholesalers and sells her food in Dangassa, retail, for cash and credit, to a clientele consisting of men and women.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profits.

She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Thanks to her parents\u2019 efforts, she managed to finish secondary school but then lacked the financial means to continue her education. She has worked from a young age to pay for necessities.\r\n\r\nDespite her job that requires a lot of time and hard work, Ana spends a lot of time raising and caring for her daughter as she is a single mother. Her daughter is now four years old and has suffered through the abandonment of her father. Now Ana and her daughter live in Pujili, a parish in the canton of Pujili which is located in Cotopaxi province in Ecuador. It\u2019s an area well known for its traditions, folklore, and music. The people take part in these activities daily even though they live a long distance from the town. Many families have learned new skills to support themselves and their communities.\r\n\r\nAna earns her living buying and selling rice. She transports it directly from the coast where it is cheaper and more available. She also raises and sells chickens. Ana is a very hardworking, enterprising woman who goes from place to place delivering the rice. For this reason she has her own transport which is a great help. Today she is seeking a loan to buy more rice for which she has outstanding orders. Sales have increased, and the income will help improve her and her daughter\u2019s standard of living as well pay for the education she deserves.\r\n\r\nAna is grateful to Fundac\u00edon Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making possible the improvement in her working and personal life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1555168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2014-03-19T15:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-18T15:00:05Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1108.95,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":87.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":88.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":89.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":92.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":94.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":95.65},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":97.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":99.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":102.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.27,"local_amount":77.15,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":78.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468212353},{"amount":85.72,"local_amount":84.5,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":85.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138339},{"amount":88.02,"local_amount":86.76,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":88.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832351},{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":90.37,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":91.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258492},{"amount":89.63,"local_amount":88.35,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":89.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517540845},{"amount":90.72,"local_amount":89.43,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":90.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516185},{"amount":95.52,"local_amount":94.16,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":95.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649770},{"amount":96.8,"local_amount":95.42,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579564573},{"amount":408.64,"local_amount":402.81,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":408.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595161885}],"funded_date":"2014-03-20T14:49:36Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:50:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":685023,"name":"Melliendres","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melliendres is 50 years old and married with two children.

","en":"Buvnar is 42 years old and married. She and her husband have three children. Buvnar has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Buvnar raises livestock, having launched this business 12 years ago by buying livestock for 15,000 KGS. Thanks to Buvnar\u2019s hard work, her farm now has 11 sheep. Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS.

They needed urea which gave them a better color, foliage which allows them to better develop.  She also bought a product called metalozato which prevented the harvest from freezing.  Her life before this loan was very difficult because she had to borrow money from individuals at high interest rates and she had to put the harvest up as collateral and she received a low price for it.  Everything changed because of these funds.

It will be used to purchase a bale of secondhand clothing, etc. He gets his supplies of merchandise in BAMAKO and makes his sales retail to men and women customers using cash or credit at his house. \r\n\r\nSEKOUBA hopes to make a monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA that will be use to pay back the loan and to reinvest in his clothing trade. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1558723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Filabougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-03-19T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-18T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.7,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sekouba ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263912},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960798},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677148},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676805},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209336},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658462},{"amount":42.24,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":561792803},{"amount":41.95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.55,"payment_id":579757912},{"amount":39.73,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.77,"payment_id":595318616},{"amount":38.38,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":20109.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.12,"payment_id":610752410}],"funded_date":"2014-03-20T08:26:42Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T13:04:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":684121,"name":"Gerlie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gerlie is 40 years old and lives in Gango, Ozamiz City.

At 26 years of age, he lives with his wife and his two children, 2 and 6 years old, for whom he constantly struggles to get daily food. He learned farming since he was young when he helped his parents in activities such as growing different products and raising and selling animals. With his experience, knowledge and hard work, he was able to save and buy a plot of land, in which he independently owns 2000 plants of grown coffee and banana crops, and where he raises and sells pigs. To add to his income, in partnership with the owner of a farm, he has 8000 more coffee trees. Its harvest is collected and sold in the town. In this way, he gets enough resources to feed and educate his small children. With the requested loan he will buy agricultural inputs at wholesale prices (pesticides, fertilizers, larvicides) and will pay the daily laborers who help him harvest. This will allow him to continue with his work and will be able to get a much more productive harvest that can be sold at a better market price. Uriel states that his greatest wish is to have a much bigger farm to grow more crops of different products, and this way he will have a more profitable business and will guarantee his family a better quality of life and well being."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":786.72,"image":{"id":1555751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is now in the last stages of finishing the construction. What remains is buying the windows for the new floor.
