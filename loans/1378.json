One is selling soups, a daily activity that brings in cash. The other is a trade she has done for 9 years which is selling clothing, cosmetics, and more to customers on credit with fixed repayment schedules. She started her business driven by the need to generate profits to support and maintain her household alongside her spouse. She purchases the articles she sells in wholesale markets where they offer bulk prices which allow her to earn a little more when she sells.

Her biggest challenge is to save and reinvest but, through her hard work and dedication, she has a great potential to expand her business.

This will allow her to have a wider variety of products to offer her customers and meet their diverse tastes and needs, which will help her maintain customer loyalty and attract new buyers.\r\n\r\nMaria says that her greatest desire is to strengthen her business, offering a wider variety of products each day.  This will guarantee financial stability that will allow her to get ahead. Engaging in this activity will make it possible for her to better overcome the difficult situation she is living in, following the death of her loved ones.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1555889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wholesale merchandise (perfume, sneakers, accessories, cosmetics, and body lotions).

Her generated salary consists of 400 GEL per month. \r\n\r\nHowever, this income is hardly enough for a 3-member family to cover all daily costs and basic needs, so Rusudan decided to get another source of income alongside her main activity. For more than 3 years she has worked as a baker and has great experience in making good confectionery products. \r\n\r\nHer request has now been approved within the framework of Kiva and Credo, so she is able to use a start-up loan for starting a private baking business in her house and getting private orders. The loan of 2,300 USD will help her to purchase a stock of merchandise such as pastry dishes. Rusudan thinks that the business will be profitable, as she will gain the loyalty of people by making a good product.

","en":"This is Erika Paola.  At the age of 15, she had no direction as to where she wanted to go in the future.  Among the high school classes she took, there wasn\u2019t one that she particularly liked.  Erika doesn\u2019t remember exactly the person she spoke with who recently graduated from the nursing program.  She only remembers being convinced about taking that career path and how much could be accomplished without leaving a patient\u2019s room.  When she came home, Erika told her mother that she wanted to study to become a nurse.  <br \/><br \/>If anything, Erika has learned that death is one of the most important parts of life and that having dignity and respect for another human being who is in the final stage of existence is a responsibility that a nurse has to confront.  Most of all, the nurse must reflect on the deeper beliefs that one has about the meaning of the profession.  <br \/><br \/>Wearing the uniform with the best smile is one part of the dress code that Erika considers to be important.  Part of the job is to help people who are in painful situations.  The primary remedy that one can give is to convey joy and hope, with an injection of optimism.  <br \/><br \/>When working with the terminally ill, the nurse is conscious about the high quality of professional care.  The individual nurse must strive to provide that level of care until the end of life, with competence and compassion, since it is necessary to relieve suffering.  The nurse must also provide the necessary assistance to the family when confronting death since it can\u2019t be avoided.  <br \/><br \/>Upon finishing the program, the graduate should have clarity with regard to the chosen career path.  Being a nurse not only means working with patients, but providing them security, respect, trust, love, and happiness.  <br \/><br \/>Having the benefit of Kiva will be a great help to Erika as she starts her nursing degree.  Her expenses will increase slightly in the future, but for now, keeping up with her household expenses will be more difficult than paying the normal tuition cost."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1557364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-19T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-18T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202254},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286395},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225102}],"funded_date":"2014-03-19T23:47:38Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":685204,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Marta, a well-established farmer, in the Chuka area of Eastern Kenya.

In this small business, her husband helps support her so that she can also get income from being a seamstress, work that she learned in the workshops that she attended.  The loan that she is requesting is to invest in her business as she would like to increase the quantity of products, but at the moment she cannot do that because she does not have the money available to invest.  Furthermore, it will be helping her to grow her business and to improve her income so that she can help improve her family's life.  In the future, Helena wishes to have a larger store in which she can sell other types of additional products.  She hopes to be able to sell clothing made by her.

The gained products are sold locally. \r\n\r\nDespite these activities the family doesn't have significant income for living in satisfying conditions, so Nana requested a loan in order to increase the family's income. Her request was approved, and she will use the requested amount for starting a trading business. Specifically, she will purchase kitchen utensils and blankets at wholesale prices and will sell in her community at an increased price. With the help of this new activity, Nana will be able to make a better living for her children and will tackle financial difficulties.

According to Pjeter, it is so much better at their current location.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to help him pay for plowing and preparing the land for seasonal planting.  Pjeter and his wife practice agriculture and livestock as a source of income.  They sell baby calves and raw milk to a nearby dairy farm and also dried beans, wheat, and watermelon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1561749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

She sells the food on the street in the main areas of her town and thanks to her personality and experience in the market she has a healthy number of loyal customers.  \r\n\r\nLike a lot of women in El Salvador, Maria is a single mother.  She has two children, aged 17 and 16, who are studying at the moment thanks to the effort she has made every day to look after them and raise them.  She hopes that her children get a good education and can enjoy a better standard of living than she has had.  \r\n\r\nThanks the community loans program at FUSAI, Maria can have access to finance and improve her situation little by little.  Considering the future well, Maria has decided to ask for this loan to invest in building materials for a kitchen, such as corrugated sheets and wood.  She tells us that she has the means to pay off the loan in the required monthly installments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1552813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is married with one son who is very young and not old enough to go to school yet.  She studied until fourth grade but had to give up her education because her parents did not have enough money to support her.  \r\n\r\nShe learnt from her husband how to work on the land a few years ago.  Growing coffee is a very important industry in her area and helps families get along in life.  Both of them work on the plantations which are a short walk away from where she lives.  She sells her product at the local market on a small scale to the various traders who visit the area.

The couple runs a farm. They keep livestock and cultivate some greens. Now Anahit needs some financial means to improve her farming activities. She wants to purchase three oxen, a cow, and forage for the livestock. The cow will allow her to gather more milk. Anahit dreams of developing her farm so that her family will be able to get more involved in agriculture and earn enough income to sustain its living in the future. This loan is important for her to develop the farm and reach this goal. So Anahit and her husband hope for a loan. As this is Anahit's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products in the past because they have no credit history.

econ\u00f3micos de edilma son un poco limitados ya que tiene varios gastos y le queda muy poco dinero para poder cumplir con el pago en la totalidad de las cuotas, se entero del convenio  kiva que ofrece la instituci\u00f3n y el pareci\u00f3 una buena manera para ella de poder realizar el pago de las cuotas. ","en":"Edilma is a person committed to her responsibilities. She has always concerned herself about improving her family's quality of life. She lives alone with her two children. She has been an educational agent of the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare for 5 years and is looking to improve how she carries out her work. She found the comprehensive care program for early childhood a the CampoAlto school. She is very interested in continuing her training to improve her professional resume and serve the children of the community together with their families. This is an important and wonderful task. She will be successful if she can work with families with the dream of building harmonious and happy lives.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Edilma belongs to a low-income community where handwork is worthwhile especially because work needs to be done in order to transform social realities. She is in search of a new way of thinking to reinvent what has prevented her community from improving. She seeks a new culture and society where living is a party and participating in life is a beautiful art where everyday is full of color and love for life itself.\r\nEdilma, from a very young age, felt that teaching was her calling. For economic reasons, she was not able to become a professional previously and do a higher level of work.\r\n\r\nThe coincidences of life at this particulate time presented the ability to study. As they say, \"sometimes you do not choose your career, it chooses you.\" Ultimately, what matters is the attitude with which you assume to challenges that bring opportunities.\r\nEdilma's economic resources are somewhat limited. She has several bills and has very little money to meet the payment of her tuition. Her loan with Kiva will be a good way for her to be able to make the tuition payments.

He is married and has four children, aged 22, 19, 17, and 13 years.  Three are school aged children. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Yusufu R. established his Palm Oil business. He began his business because he could not further his studies because of lack of finances. His elder sister advised him to join her husband's business instead of sitting at home idling, and he thought it a wise decision. Several years later he decided to be independent and was successful.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and ten hours a day, he earns about Le2,000,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le4,000,000. Yusufu R. requires a loan in order to purchase rubbers [plastic containers] of palm oil.   The loan has helped him improve his business because he is now able to purchase large amounts of palm oil.  Yusifu faced a lot of difficulties this year; prices of palm oil have decrease in terms of selling cost.  He planned to purchase more bags of rice in order to cover the losses on the palm oil product.  His major challenge is that the sales of palm oil is very slow now.  He hopes to make more sales during the rainy season.   He thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1415760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase rubbers of palm oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2014-03-20T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-19T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusufu R.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.24,"local_amount":667000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-23T08:47:37Z","rounded_local_amount":669417.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467830218},{"amount":154.24,"local_amount":667000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":669417.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479052639},{"amount":154.24,"local_amount":667000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":669417.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490748744},{"amount":154.24,"local_amount":667000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":669417.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504177440},{"amount":154.24,"local_amount":667000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":669417.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462077},{"amount":153.8,"local_amount":665000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":667410.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529946099}],"funded_date":"2014-03-23T11:40:52Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:06:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":685417,"name":"Ashkhen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\t\r\nAshkhen lives in Lukashin village of Armavir region.

She wants to manage her time well, as she wants to get the most out of her current situation. Since she just started working, she knows that she will have to help out with some household expenses, and on top of this, she has monthly tuition payments. The money she earns will not cover all her costs, and this is why she is interested in working with Kiva, which will help her with her expenses through a loan.

","en":"Jumakan is 41 years old, married and raising four children together with her husband. Jumakan has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Jumakan works with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding, after having started 19 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Jumakan's persistent work, she currently has three dairy cows, one calf and 20 sheep. She also has a plot of land on which she grows potatoes, cucumbers and tomatoes each year, for farm consumption and for selling.

To cover better living expense and tuition fees for the children, Ha wants to expand her business by taking out a loan from Anh Chi Em Program to buy more piglets. \r\n\r\nHa hopes that, by constant effort in work, her family life would be improved, her children will be more abundant and successful. \r\n\r\nHa is elected to be team leader of the group of 11 Thai people.

She couragously carries the whole household economy on her fragile female shoulders, raising the children, working and striving sparing no effort. Gulchehra taught her children dignity, and now they are their mother's helpers. Gulchehra's husband is a migrant worker. Once a year he comes home to see his family. He sends money to his wife when he can, however it is not enough in order to feed the family, provide clothing and shoes and small, female \"whims\". \r\n\r\nGulchehra has secondary education. After finishing school her father married her away, and she was not able to continue her education. Gulchehra has more than twenty years of experience in livestock breeding. She and her husband started with two lambs, but her husband went to the Russian Federation out of necessity and she continued this business alone. To her joy, her children grew up and became her helpers. \r\n\r\nCurrently Gulchehra has more than eight heads of livestock. She would like to take this opportunity to purchase yet some lambs and fodder for them. Due to the season, it is not profitable for her to sell her livestock now, and she does not have enough money on her hands to purchase new livestock.

He has a large and happy family. He lives in a village. He is married and has a child. He has secondary education. Despite the fact that he did not receive higher education, Arslonbek is very responsible and knows his work perfectly well. \r\n\r\nArslonbek does not like to waste time. He always strives to know things. He does all his work on time and always make time for his only child. Arslonbek has a large plot of land and a lot of free space. Due to the location of the village in a green area, Arslonbek's family has bred sheep for many years. His father was a shepherd. Currently Arslonbek also works with livestock breeding. After having overcome difficulties for a period of ten years, Arslonbek gained large experience in this area. \r\n\r\nArslonbek has seven lambs and three heads of cattle. Every day he leads the sheep and cows to the pasture. Arslonbek also works at a poultry farm to receive additional income. As spring has come and the whole winter stock is used, Arslonbek decided to purchase fodder for the livstock. However as he did not sell his sheep yet and thus does not have the necessary sum of money on his hands, he decided to take a loan. With this aim he turned to \"MDO Arvand\". He very much hopes for support and thanks you for the help in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1558343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-03-20T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-19T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Arslonbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1475.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1524.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":307.35,"local_amount":1475.3,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1478.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081270},{"amount":317.65,"local_amount":1524.7,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1527.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562150}],"funded_date":"2014-03-21T21:33:06Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":685675,"name":"Trecenas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trecenas works hard to support her family.

","en":"Aliboy is a skilled handyman and very capable around the home. He is married and has three children. Two of them are still in school, and the third has graduated and helps his father, working alongside him to bring enough income home. Aliboy's wife takes care of the home, but doesn't sit idle; she helps her husband and children in every way, milks the cows and sells the milk. Aliboy has a high school education. They live in the village of Utkansoy, a place where it is very convenient and profitable to raise livestock. The majority of residents have sheep or cows.\r\n\r\nAliboy too has a decade of experience taking care of cattle. His cows always have fresh and delicious milk, the place where they live is always clean and the cows are all healthy. During the day he sends them out to pasture, where in the springtime there is always a lot of fresh green grass. His son watches after them, while his father runs errands. Aliboy has another profession: he is a mason and takes orders in home construction. The income received from his trade goes toward the family's daily expenses, and the income from the cattle toward more important things with higher costs. Aliboy has a lot of plans, and one of them is to buy a cow and some feed. But at the moment he doesn't have enough money on hand, and therefore he has decided to ask for a loan. He hopes very much that Kiva will help him to realize his plans, and he sends thanks in advance for the support.

She is 48 and married with four children. She and her husband have been working in animal husbandry and milk sales for many years. She has a high school education, as does her husband. Of course, they dream that their children will become educated people in the future, and they pay a lot of attention to their children's education. Zioda works as hard as her husband around the house and helps him take care of the cattle.
