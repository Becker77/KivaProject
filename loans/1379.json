","en":"Elmira is 40 and married with five children. She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 20 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has five milking cows and one stallion, with a monthly income of 20,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Elmira has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan to purchase cows and increase her head count of livestock. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing her quantity of domestic cattle and to save toward building a new house for her oldest

Despite living alone with his mother, he has always devoted himself to working hard in his farming and ranching activities.  At the moment, he is completing a seventh-grade level education on the weekends.  Jos\u00e9 is single and has no children.  <br \/><br \/>Since the age of 12, Jos\u00e9 has spent his time looking after cattle and working in agriculture.  He works Monday through Friday on a farm where he is responsible for taking care of cattle.  This job helps him to cover his expenses and provide a little bit of income for his family, which includes five younger siblings.  Since he is the oldest child and has to work, this explains why he had to quit school temporarily.  Jos\u00e9 works hard at his studies on the weekends, but most of his time is spent working with cattle.  His mother sells basic products at the market.  <br \/><br \/>Jos\u00e9 is requesting a loan so that he can buy two steers that he plans to maintain and put to good use.  He plans to fatten them and then sell them at a better price than what he paid.  At the moment, a neighbor is willing to sell him two steers at a good price, but he doesn\u2019t have the financial resources to buy them.  For this reason, he is requesting financial support.  <br \/><br \/>His dreams as a young man are to finish his studies and enroll for a university degree in the future.

For three years, Saodat has been earning a living raising young bulls for sale. At the moment she maintains this business on her own, since her husband and sons are migrant labourers in Russia. Saodat wants to increase her family's budget, but to do this she needs to increase her head count of livestock. With this goal in mind she is requesting a loan to purchase a pair of young bulls for fattening and resale. She hopes for financial support.

Because the price of pigs and pig feed is growing, Ni Komang then expect an increase in borrowing in the next period.\r\nThe group received the loan with the loan amount of 21.000.000 IDR. Nothing has changed in the membership and composition of the board.

restaurant. He needs this loan to continue with his studies and to study English at a language institute. He is the son of a single mother, who works independently and doesn't have any additional economic support. His family is made up of some uncles who are the same age and his grandmother, who does informal work and lives in Soacha. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, he wants to work in his field of study. Cooking is what he most enjoys, and he wants to be outstanding so that he can help his mother and family, develop himself as a professional chef and have a solid base of English in order to open up future work opportunities. \r\n<p>\r\nThe Kiva partnership will be a great help, since the wages he earns are low and the extra costs associated with his studies don't allow him to pay the upfront tuition costs. Having the benefit of Kiva financing will be a great help for him and his family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1558127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester's tuition ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-21T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-20T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Stiven ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202265},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286406},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225113}],"funded_date":"2014-03-21T04:13:18Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":683457,"name":"Edgar Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edgar tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa e hijos en el distrito de Buenos Aires, una comunidad que se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda, ubicada en la Provincia de Morropon, que pertenece a la Regi\u00f3n Piura, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<P>\nEl brinda servicio de carga en su carretilla transportando bultos como cajas, sacos de carga y todo tipo de bultos, es un joven emprendedor, por las tardes brinda servicio de secretario en la Parroquia de su distrito, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 1 000 nuevos soles para terminar de construir la segunda parte de su dormitorio y de esta manera tener un lugar agradable para descansar.\n\n\n","en":"Edgar is 23 years old and lives with his wife and children in Buenos Aires district, an agricultural, commercial, and livestock-rearing community located in Morropon Province, part of Piura Region on the north coast of Peru. \r\n<P>\r\nHe provides cart transportation services, carrying loads like boxes, sacks, and other types of packages.

She would like to enjoy a higher quality of life and well-being with her children. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1558211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sublimation machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Itagui","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-03-21T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-20T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Zenaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":130729},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":134359},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":138090},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":141924},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":145864},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":149915},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":154077},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":158355},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":162752},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167271},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":171915},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":176689},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":181595},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":186637},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":191819},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":197145},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":202619},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":208245}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.72},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.28,"local_amount":130745,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T10:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":131683.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468227987},{"amount":66.06,"local_amount":134315,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T10:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":135278.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245618},{"amount":1344.66,"local_amount":2734940,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2754568.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856352}],"funded_date":"2014-03-28T00:38:46Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T14:48:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":683483,"name":"Pedro Plutarco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"pedro vive en casa propia con su familia, e se dedica a la agricultura desde hace varios a\u00f1os su principal siembra es el ma\u00edz y frijol, comercializa sus productos en los diferentes mercados que se encuentran cerca de su lugar de residencia, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos que se le presentan en su hogar, Pedro esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de abono, fertilizantes, controles de plagas, herbicidas, semillas, etc. para continuar con su siembra y poderle dar a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.

She is originally from one of the towns in the northern part of the country.  She is known in life for being an enterprising, responsible, and determined woman who wants her children to get ahead and have a better future.  Tomasa tries to provide them with the opportunities that she unfortunately did not have due to the lack of financial resources.  However, she is now studying for a law degree and will be finishing soon.  <br \/><br \/>Thanks to her drive to succeed on a personal level, this small businesswoman has devoted herself to selling new clothes such as women\u2019s garments in various styles, menswear, children\u2019s outfits, as well as shoes and cosmetics that she offers as a traveling vendor.  Most of her merchandise is sold on credit, so she must collect payments on a weekly or biweekly basis.  She also owns a vending stall located at her house where she offers products such as basic grains, oil, detergents, frozen products, and other items.  Tomasa buys her products with cash at different markets in other towns.  <br \/><br \/>One of her dreams it to finish her studies so that she can provide a better future for her children.  She also wants to grow her business so that she will have more income.

He also works in agriculture.  He rents a shop near his home where he works from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. offering hair cuts.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy a motorcycle since he only has part of the money he needs to buy it.  He needs the motorcycle to get around the city because he wastes much of the day having to depend on buses, which is uncomfortable because of the bad public transportation service.\r\n\r\nThis young entrepreneur dreams of having his own shop and not having to rent since it is so expensive.

She is a resident of Caloocan 5, Philippines. She and her husband are managing their household while operating a business. She is working hard to sustain their financial expenses.\r\n\r\nZenaida is a coconut dealer. Most coconuts in the Philippines are sold by street vendors pushing wooden carts. The coconuts are served either with one end cut and just with a straw to serve as the container itself. Coconuts can be offered where the juice and the edible part of the coconut are put into a plastic with a straw. Regular customers are those who are thirsty and those who want to refresh themselves from the heat of the sun. They earn a minimum of 600 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operations of her business, Zenaida is requesting a loan for 20,000 PHP, which she will use loan to buy more coconuts to be supplied to her customers. She hopes to expand her business and dreams of becoming rich. \r\n\r\nZenaida meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week where she finds strength and inspiration from God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1494042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase coconuts to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-03-21T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-20T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.66,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2686.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467888300},{"amount":90,"local_amount":3999.99,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4029.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479111540},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6715.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490806693},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5372.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504229463},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1333.38,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1343.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517516546}],"funded_date":"2014-03-21T18:54:49Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:55:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":685879,"name":"Lilian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilian is a 27-year-old married woman with two children who lives in Kamwenge, Uganda.

Their elder two children go to high school while the youngest one stays at home. \n\nMr. Gantugs is requesting a loan of 2,275 USD to buy vacuum-insulated windows for better protection against outside noise and dust. By installing those windows, his family will live in clean environment without any dust. As spring comes to Mongolia, dust becomes a major issue in slum district because there is no cemented road or any grass growing. His youngest child has developed an allergy to dust and the other children are becoming allergic to dust. So the borrower wants to install vacuum-insulated windows as the dust is coming in with the wind through the present

together with her husband, is raising three children. Aimeerim has a secondary-specialized education. She graduated from a medical college and has a nursing degree. Her professional career began in a local hospital, then she got married but continued to work there. Aimeerim is very responsible, gregarious and cheerful by nature. Aimeerim and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 14 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aimeerim's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 1 horse, and 10 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). She also cultivates a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows potatoes and sainfoin. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Aimeerim turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. After purchasing the cattle, they will be located on her farm. In the summer, they will be under the care of a shepherd. Aimeerim plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1562743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Saruu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-03-21T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-20T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aimeerim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2328},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2192},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2256},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2322},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2389},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2459},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2531},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2605},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2681},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2759},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2839},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2639}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.62,"local_amount":2328,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2431.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053634},{"amount":42.01,"local_amount":2192,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2289.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749803},{"amount":43.24,"local_amount":2256,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2356.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178537},{"amount":44.51,"local_amount":2322,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-19T09:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2425.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463174},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":2389,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2495.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947188},{"amount":47.13,"local_amount":2459,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2568.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440522},{"amount":48.51,"local_amount":2531,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2643.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578337},{"amount":49.93,"local_amount":2605,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2721.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579488962},{"amount":209.26,"local_amount":10918,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":11404.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436135}],"funded_date":"2014-03-22T10:00:08Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":685900,"name":"Sanjar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sanjar is young and purposeful man.

After the death of her husband, who was the main provider for the family,  Sayrabubu was in search of a source of income for her family. She began a small business sewing women's dresses, frock-coats, skirts and coats. She started this business in 1991 with initial start-up capital in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). It is a good business, but more importantly, Sayrabubu enjoys doing it. It brings in an average monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Sayrabubu turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy materials for making and sewing women's dresses, frock-coats, skirts and coats. Sayrabubu plans to invest the earnings from the loan to increase sales turnover. She also intends to save money to buy a plot of land to build a house on."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1562825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials for sewing women's clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-03-21T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-20T17:30:04Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sayrabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3624},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3715},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3807},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3903},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4100},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4203},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4308},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4415},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4526},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4639},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4760}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.85},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":3624,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3653.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479053635},{"amount":68.73,"local_amount":3715,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3745.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749804},{"amount":70.43,"local_amount":3807,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3838.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178538},{"amount":72.21,"local_amount":3903,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-19T09:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3935.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463175},{"amount":74,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947189},{"amount":75.85,"local_amount":4100,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4133.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440523},{"amount":77.75,"local_amount":4203,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4237.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578338},{"amount":79.7,"local_amount":4308,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4343.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579488963},{"amount":339.29,"local_amount":18340,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":18491.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436136}],"funded_date":"2014-03-23T01:21:38Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":685904,"name":"Arsenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of ten children, Arsenia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fish vending business in the Philippines and also earns additional income from farming rice and raising pigs.

She hopes to grow her rice healthily and fruitfully so as to sell it for a good price. This will enable her to improve her family\u2019s lifestyle and build on her savings to extend her farmland.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1562907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The loan will be used to buy more oil and grease and will help Hadija to generate greater profits and buy food for her family if need arises. Hadija hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a hardware store. \r\n\r\nHadija is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Carlos hopes to start construction on his home, for which he already has some materials.  It took a lot of effort for him to be able to buy the materials he has.

Lusik's son is a taxi driver who works day and night to be able to sustain his family. \r\n\r\nLusik cultivates some fruit trees and vegetables and sells the harvest at local markets. This activity is very important, for it helps gather enough income for her family's basic costs. Lusik has now applied for this loan to be able to make some investments to her land cultivation business. She would like to purchase seeds, fertilizer and fuel for land cultivation. The loan will be a huge help for her and Lusik hopes for lenders' goodwill. \r\n\r\nLusik has already applied for a loan to local financial institutions before but, because of very difficult financial conditions, wasn't able to pay it back on time. Now, she is sure that she will be able to cover monthly payments on time and has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":676,"image":{"id":1563022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Oliver hopes that in the future, she will be able to open a soft drinks business. \r\n\r\nOliver is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is a new client who is 59 years old. He has applied for a loan of UGX 1,500,000 to hire labor to help him clear his farm. He is challenged with low milk output from his cows because he is not feeding the cows adequately.

Thanks to her parent's efforts, she managed to finish high school, but due to a lack of financial resources she was sent out to work from the time she was very young in order to support the household's needs.  In spite of having a job that demands a lot of her time and effort, she did not neglect her studies and because of this, by her own rights, she has obtained a college degree.  \r\n\r\nShe dealt with adverse circumstances, including the abandonment of her father, but this did not stop her from excelling in her personal and work life.  Now Piedad lives with her mother and her brother in a family house located in the Cotopaxi province in the Republic of Ecuador.  This area is called Pujili, and is known for its folkloric traditions. As far as the economy, it is an area that is particularly devoted to music and agriculture.\r\n\r\nPiedad works making and delivering breakfasts and snacks to the various offices in the area.

She is 36 years old and in a common-law relationship.  She has three children (ages 16, 15, and 9).  The two older children are in high school and the youngest attends elementary school.  Her husband is a merchant.  <br \/><br \/>Natalia and her husband own a candy shop where every day they sell sweets and snacks of all types and flavors.  They sell their products either in bulk or individually.  They also have two employees who are paid a monthly salary for their work.  Natalia and her husband have been in this business for 15 years and it has allowed them to get ahead.  This business is a family tradition since her mother was also in the same line of work.  <br \/><br \/>Her loan will be used to buy necessary ingredients for preparing sweets and snacks.  This is her first loan with the Communal Bank and she likes how quickly it was approved.  Her dreams include providing the best education for her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5650,"image":{"id":1558082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for making snacks and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Calceta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-03-21T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-20T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":5650,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natalia Fernanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betsy Annabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Fabricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulo Ruben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina Sebastiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5631.59,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":5650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":563.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":563.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":565},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":564.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":565.01,"local_amount":563.16,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-17T09:43:50Z","rounded_local_amount":565.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467918056},{"amount":1695,"local_amount":1689.48,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1695,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138874},{"amount":1130,"local_amount":1126.32,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832785},{"amount":1130,"local_amount":1126.32,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258832},{"amount":1129.99,"local_amount":1126.31,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1129.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541104}],"funded_date":"2014-03-22T04:13:51Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:34:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":686059,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is a married man.

His monthly earnings for this are 180 AZN.\r\n\r\nAzerbaijan people have high demands for fresh fruits and vegetables. They use them to cook national and delicious dishes.

una ardua charla sobre la situaci\u00f3n llegaron a la conclusi\u00f3n y acuerdo de un pr\u00e9stamo el cual se utilizar\u00eda para el pago del primer semestre de los estudios es aqu\u00ed donde inicia el cumplimiento de un gran sue\u00f1o, Pero en este momento ella no tiene un empleo, as\u00ed que quien carga con toda la responsabilidad econ\u00f3mica del hogar  es el esposo el cual le ayuda en ocasiones con una parte del dinero para  el estudio, por lo tanto a ella se le hace muy dif\u00edcil costearse los estudios pues sin un empleo no hay entradas de dinero, es por eso que ella necesita el convenio con kiva, ya que el esposo es el \u00fanico que le colabora con una parte del estudio y ella no tiene empleo fijo. \nA pesar de las circunstancias y los problemas ella no quiere abandonar los estudios pues sue\u00f1a con ser una mujer exitosa y darles una mejor vida a los hijos, a\u00fan falta mucho eso est\u00e1 muy claro, pero ella se esfuerza cada d\u00eda por terminar de subir este peque\u00f1o escal\u00f3n el cual tiene un gran significado en la vida y el que la hace sentir orgullosa de ser una mujer emprendedora. ","en":"In 2006, Srta. Ana Roci\u00f3 had the opportunity to satisfactorily complete her high school studies.  Her dream had always been to enroll at an institution of higher learning so that she could study to become a nursing assistant.  This would allow her to become a professional.  Due to her own financial instability and that of her family, she found it impossible to enroll and become the professional that she had dreamed.  She decided to work with the intent of being able to afford her studies, but she found it to be very difficult.  At this point in her life, she also had the great blessing of becoming a mother.  However, things did not go as planned in the final months of her pregnancy.  Her little boy died 15 days after being born.  <br \/><br \/>Recovering from that loss was not easy since her life took a 180 degree turn.  All of her ambitions, dreams, and goals had disappeared, but as the saying goes, \u201cthere\u2019s always calm after the storm\u201d.  Three years after this unfortunate event, Roci\u00f3 became pregnant again.  Receiving this news revived her dreams once again, and at that moment, she wanted to provide a better life for this little one.  <br \/><br \/>Even though she had the desire to obtain academic training, her life revolved around her baby and her husband.  Financial problems presented themselves when her husband couldn\u2019t find work.  Being able to fulfill her dream became more difficult each day.  <br \/><br \/>Shortly thereafter, her husband was able to secure a good job and take care of their financial situation.  A few months ago, Roci\u00f3 gave birth to her baby and it motivated her once again to pursue her dream.  <br \/><br \/>One day when Roci\u00f3 was with her sister, they had a deep discussion about her situation and how to resolve it.  They agreed that a loan could be used to pay for her first semester of studies, which would help her get started down the path of fulfilling her greatest wish.  At the moment she has no job, so all of the financial responsibility lies with her husband.  On occasion, he will be able to provide part of the money for her studies.  It is very difficult to afford school without a job or other means of generating income.  For this reason, Roci\u00f3 needs a Kiva loan since her husband can only afford to pay for part her studies and she does not have a regular job.  <br \/><br \/>Despite the circumstances and problems she faces, Roci\u00f3 does not want to abandon her studies.  She dreams of becoming a successful woman and providing a better life for her children.  At least that much is clear.  Roci\u00f3 strives each day to complete little steps that have great significance in life.  This makes her proud to be an enterprising woman."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1557918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

After our 18+ years working in corporations including Netflix and eBay, our vision is to put our collective skill sets together and do something meaningful that would make a difference for both of us and others. We believe that everything has value, no matter how damaged it is, and we enjoy giving new life to things that might otherwise be overlooked or thrown away, which, as a metaphor, fits our lives perfectly. \r\n\r\nWe are Social Entrepreneurs who work within the emerging new industrial revolution of Makers\/Do It Yourself Micro-Manufacturing. Considered innovators by many, we are utilizing our background in art and design to create inventive ways to repurpose what some call junk into beautiful art, jewelry and home d\u00e9cor products, while enabling ourselves and others to heal during and by this process. The manufacturing of our metal stamped products is done 100% by hand. This is our number one area of growth, with our retailers requesting higher product volume than we can supply. By automating the process, we can build product at least 4-5 times faster to meet the market demand.

","en":"This is Fabian, a student in technical systems. He tells his story because the only thing he wants is to study and to become a better person every day. He wants to be able to finish his studies in technical systems and to continue advancing toward his goals and continue getting better in things every day.  He also wants from now on to be able to help his parents with all that they need since, thanks to them, he is able to study at only 22 years of age. \r\n\r\nHe was born in 1992. At the age of 6 he was already in primary school in first grade and thus he arrived at high school. Thereupon he grew very quickly and finished all his studies until the 11th grade of high school and he graduated. He started working in electricity and then a few years afterwards he wanted to study a profession or something in order to be able to become a better person in the future. He wanted to go into some technical career. First, he decided on business administration, however he did not have the income and was only able to study for 6 months. He went to start the second semester and was unable to do so due to economic reasons. Nevertheless in those six months he learned to do various things. Then after some time he decided to study another technical career and focused on hardware assembly and computer maintenance. He is already in the first semester where he has already learned to install programs and dismantle and assemble computers and do all kinds of computer maintenance. In his free time, he works in electricity however he does not have the funds to pay his semester\u2019s tuition since his income is minimal and thus he needs a subsidy from Kiva so that he can continue forward. He wants to finish technical systems so that he can get a good job and help his parents since they have been helping him all of this time. \r\n\r\nNow is the time for Fabian to help his parents\u2019 realize their great dream, which is to own their home and live peacefully the rest of their days with the family that they most love in this world..   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1559447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester's tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-22T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-21T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":153688.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202268},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":153688.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286409},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":153688.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225116}],"funded_date":"2014-03-22T03:06:40Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":686090,"name":"Sona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sona lives with her husband and three sons in Qarahunj village, which is in Syuniq region. \r\n\r\nSona has been involved in agriculture for more than eight years.

In the future, Gita plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores called nasals are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce and shrewd businesswomen.

She has been involved in this business since childhood and has been able to support her family with her earnings. As she wants to increase her business, Juana is applying for a loan with Friendship Bridge. She will use the funds to purchase materials such as yarn in a variety of colors as well as needles and other materials. Along with her husband, Juana makes backpacks to fill the orders of her customers.\r\n\r\nJuana is the sole member of her Trust Bank who cannot read or write in Spanish. However, she is most eager to learn about many things and can do so in the monthly meetings when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares information on topics like business management and investment, women\u2019s identity and leadership, education and empowerment and much more.\r\n \r\nThe financial capital provided by Kiva investors combined with the educational training by Friendship Bridge are a winning combination for the women.
