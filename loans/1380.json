He has opened a small grocery store which he has been managing by himself for the past 13 years.  It is thanks to this small shop that he is able to meet the needs of his family.  Thanks to his warm welcome and to the good relationships he entertains with his neighbors, he has also managed to attract an increasingly large group of faithful customers.  However, he can no longer fully meet the demand of such a large group of customers, hence his decision to apply for a loan.

It is a town well known for its traditional natural dye techniques and striking textiles. It is here that the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Gemelas\u201d or \u201cThe Twins\u201d was just formed. The eight women in the group are just beginning their first loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. They have a variety of businesses including the sale of clothing and textiles, corn and seafood. One of them owns a Moto taxi called a \u201ctuk tuk\u201d which is a common form of transportation in many towns in Guatemala. The average age of the women is 33 years.\r\n\r\nPaulina is a 23-year-old married woman who belongs to \u201cLas Gemelas\u201d. She has twin daughters and it is in their honor that the Trust Bank is called \u201cLas Gemelas\u201d. As her husband fishes every day, Paula sells seafood and is requesting a loan which she will use to expand her business. She plans to buy fishing gear including hooks, nylon fishing line, baskets, and other materials. Paulina tells us that the business is giving the family a pretty good income and also gives her the opportunity to continue with her education. She goes to school at night and is currently in the 9th grade. She is a great example that it is never too late to learn and improve oneself. She gets up early each morning to take care of her husband and their daughters, then goes to the market to sell seafood and then attends school at night.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank enjoy getting together at their monthly meetings. During these meetings, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer provides educational trainings on various subjects. The women are anxious to learn about topics like women\u2019s health and hygiene, identity and leadership, and budgeting and business administration.\r\n\r\nThese dynamic women want to take the opportunity to express their gratitude to KIVA investors from all parts of the world who believe in them and their goals.

The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cParaje Tzancoral\u201d, is located here and consists of nine women, full of hope for a better and more prosperous future. They have joined the Trust Bank for their own personal development and to improve the lives of their families and community. The women are involved in various commercial ventures including the sale of everyday items including rice, beans, pasta, sugar and tortillas. Some work in animal husbandry and raise chickens, ducks, turkeys and pigs. Their husbands are mostly agricultural field workers who do not make enough to support the families and so the income that the ladies generate is very useful and valuable.\r\n\r\nCatarina is a 54-year-old mother of five children. She sells tortillas, an indispensable food in the Guatemalan highlands, that is made from pure corn. Her business is progressing well and she wants to increase it even more. Catarina wants to sell vegetables in the same little storefront where she sells tortillas. She has applied for a loan which she will use to buy larger quantities of corn to produce more tortillas and purchase vegetables as well. Catarina has two employees in order to meet the demands in her customers. She is happy to be able to provide part-time employment so that her employees have an income to support their families.\r\n\r\nThe nine women of the \u201cParaje Tzancoral\u201d Trust Bank thank KIVA investors for their generosity and confidence. The additional capital with the small loans combined with the monthly educational trainings on topics like effective business administration and budgeting offered by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer provides the women with real tools to empower themselves. In this way, the ladies are facing a brighter and more prosperous future.

","en":"Anipakhon is 60 years old and together with her husband is raising three children.  Anipakhon has a high school education.  The main source of income for her family is cattle raising.  She started this business 24 years ago by purchasing cattle for 5,000 som.  Thanks to Anipakhon's hard work she now has 6 cows and 20 sheep.  Her monthly income is 10,000 som.  In order to expand her business Anipakhon turned to the bank of Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to purchase cows.  Some profits from her business Anipakhon plans to reinvest into expanding her herd and save the rest to be used for the repairs of her

The Tunas Mekar Asih group made the payment of 16,500,000 IDR to MUK on time. They tell us that there\u2019s an increasing profit that they earned during the loan period of eight months. The pigs can grow fat and healthy. They can sell the pigs at a high price because there is lots of demand from the market. The situations stimulate their spirit to run the business. \r\n\r\nIn this ninth loan, Ni Ketut sold six of her fattened pigs and earned a satisfactory profit. One member feels the benefit of the pig business. Now she has enough profit to run the business with her own capital and stop borrowing. She said she is grateful to lenders, Kiva and MUK. She becomes an example to other friends in her group.\r\n\r\nThe Tunas Mekar Asih group is receiving a new loan of 15,000,000 IDR. The loan will be used for increasing the number of piglets, renovating the barns and purchasing superior feed. The group still needs a loan until they have enough capital to run the business by themselves.

They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. She took some land for lease and started vegetable cultivation on a small scale. She started with a limited supply of vegetables like tomatoes and potatoes and grew to sell more than seven varieties like brinjal (eggplant), cucumbers, beans, carrots, and radishes. She has developed a very good relationship with her customers in the village, as she sells fresh and high-quality vegetables.\r\n\r\nShe likes the fact that she can cater to the needs of the people in her village.

el a\u00f1o 2011 cuando se grad\u00fao, al a\u00f1o siguiente entro a otro instituto a estudiar  Auxiliar de Enfermer\u00eda, pero le toco retirarse al comenzar el segundo semestre por problemas econ\u00f3micos.\nEntro a trabajar en marroquiner\u00eda, all\u00ed el trabajo era tiempo completo, con lo que ahorro se pudo matricular en CAMPO ALTO para volver a estudiar Auxiliar de

He lives with his parents and his younger brother.  His father works as a driver for public services and his mother's a homemaker who sometimes works during the day.  His younger brother is in sixth grade at the same school from which William Enrique graduated.\r\n\r\nWilliam Enrique began studying to be a nurse's assistant in another school the year after he graduated in 2011.  He had to withdraw at the beginning of his second semester, though, because of financial problems.  He started working a full-time job in the leather industry.  With the money he was able to save he registered at CampoAlto to go back to studying to be a nurse's assistant.  He could walk to school so he saved on transportation.\r\n\r\nHe also works construction in a laundry at night.  He works for himself as well as to help out at home.  The economic situation is sometimes difficult, so he and his mother look for ways to help his father.\r\n\r\nHis greatest desire is to finish his studies and join the army because he wants to be a soldier and serve his country in the health field.  He would like to travel to small towns on health campaigns.\r\n\r\nHe likes nursing because it's a nice and enjoyable field of study.  It's technical and practical, and he's contented with what he learns every day.  In addition to nursing he loves to play soccer, and he plays on Sunday at El Tunal Park whenever he can.\r\n\r\nWilliam Enrique's dreams don't stop there.  He would like to study medicine some day in the not-too-distant future and specialize in medical surgery.\r\n\r\nHe would be very grateful if Kiva grants him the student subsidy for which he's applying.  This would make it very easy for him to be able to get the rest of the money to finish this semester.\r\n\r\nHe knows that nothing in life is easy.  He wants to strive to achieve his dreams, and even more so when he he's given the opportunity.  He will show his gratitude by maintaining a good academic standing and disciplinary record so as not to disappoint himself or others.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1558075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay his tuition for a semester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-22T17:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-21T17:10:08Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William  Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882882},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202263},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286404},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":153637.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225111}],"funded_date":"2014-03-22T18:30:46Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":685488,"name":"Melchelor","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Melchelor est un homme de 41 ans fianc\u00e9 p\u00e8re de 3 enfants dont l'\u00e2ge varie entre 3 mois et 09 ans.

Limited resources didn\u2019t allow him to finish school, so he only studied through the ninth grade.  Currently he is single and lives with his parents and sister.\r\n\r\nFor the past six years Francisco has worked sowing corn.  He learned this work from his father, because he taught him how to do farming work during planting season.  These days this young man grows two hectares and also works as a driver because people hire him to make trips.  He takes advantage of the opportunity for extra income for his family.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for this loan from CrediCampo to buy a motorcycle because he only has some of the money and needs to supplement it with a loan.  This will help Francisco a lot, because when he is planting he has to travel about 30 minutes by bicycle, and with a motorcycle he could do it in less time.  Also, it would help him when he is sent to the city.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he wants to have his own family.

","en":"59-year-old Khairiniso, who lives in the Shahrituz District, is beginning her own business baking Tajik lepyoshki (Central Asian bread). She has experience in this field. Over the last year and a half, she has worked in a bakery, baking and selling lepyoshki. Now she wants to open her own bakery and make a family business out of it. <br \/><br \/>In Tajikistan, without leyoshki you can't have a workday meal or a celebratory feast; Otherwise, going over to someone's house as guest,  it is essential to bring a few lepyoshka rolls. Indeed, any hospitable host will distribute lepyoshki to leaving guests along with a take-away portion of the meal. It's entirely not a coincidence that Tajiks of every age and social class have a reverence towards bread. Lepyoshka is the highest value of the Tajik people and of every family.<br \/><br \/>Khairiniso knows very well all the intricacies of baking lepyoshki in a tandoor oven. Khairinso has also constructed a small bakery close to her house. Now she is requesting a loan to buy raw materials (flour and coal) to make lepyoshki. Her son will help her with this business. Thanks to the loan, she will be able to start her own business. She really relies on this financial assistance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1480.83,"image":{"id":1563008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

He is an attentive father to five children and a beloved husband. From very early on in his childhood, he has practiced livestock breeding. However, for the past 15 years, this activity has served as main source of income.  As he has a big family, it is necessary for him to simultaneously work several jobs. Jalolidin has been able to combine livestock breeding and collective crop farming. He mainly raises, fattens up and sells cattle and sheep. From this he earns an income which he spends on housing, his children's education and living expenses. Jalolidin and his wife also strive to put aside money for even just one of their children to enroll in university. He really wants his children to become highly educated, because he was unable to go to university due to his circumstances. <br \/><br \/>Taking advantage of the seasonal opportunity, he wants to buy an additional cow and livestock feed. But he does not want to touch his savings, as to start saving money again would be difficult and his children are already teenagers. In the hope of getting help and support, Jalolidin turned to MDO Arvand. He really hopes that he will be able to obtain the necessary amount and fulfill his plans. He thanks Kiva for its positive role in his life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1562587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow and livestock feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-03-22T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-21T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jalolidin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":593.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":606.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":593.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":606.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875665}],"funded_date":"2014-03-23T00:30:26Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":684235,"name":"Le\u00f3n Jaime","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Le\u00f3n es un adulto mayor, que ha dedicado toda su vida a la reparaci\u00f3n de carros viejos, para luego venderlos o ponerlos a trabajar. \u00c9l aprendi\u00f3 el oficio de mec\u00e1nico, trabajando desde ni\u00f1o al lado de su padre.

Her father is retired and her mother is a homemaker. Her eldest brother works in Russia. Her younger brother and sister are in school. <br \/><br \/>After graduating from school, Sadafmohi began earning a living. She learned the seamstress profession and has been sewing for about five years. Sadafmohi primarily sews pillows, kurpachas (a narrow quilted blanket for sitting on) and kurpas (a narrow throw). Her mother and sister also help with this business. Sarafmohi is requesting a loan to buy a new sewing machine as her own sewing machine is outdated and causes her discomfort while she works.

Before, he was selling on top of a table, but with his previous loans he has made progress. He rented a shop where he is now able to increase sales and attract more customers. His business is open from 6am to 7pm daily, and he is able to make a good monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis is Edson's eighth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used the previous loans, all of which he successfully repaid, to rent a shop and restock clothes. Edson earned a profit, which he used to build a house and to buy a home fridge, sofa set, and TV. As a father, Edson paid for school fees and home food expenses. He really appreciates your support. He will use this loan to open a food shop, where he will sell dry food like rice, maize flour, baking flour, cooking oil, beans and related items. He dreams that one day he will be able to build another nice house. \r\n\r\nEdson will share this loan with his loan group Wastara, which totals 13 members.

Guliza has a secondary education. Guliza and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. They also have a large apple orchard on the territory of their home. They started this business 8 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Guliza's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 40 sheep and 20 lambs on her farm. Her monthly income is 20,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and apples. She also cultivates a 5.0 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows beans and perennial grasses. The received harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Guliza turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy sheep to increase the size of her herd. Guliza plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

Cholpon has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Cholpon practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 12 years ago with 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Cholpon's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow and 10 sheep on her farm, as well as a 1.0 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows watermelons, corn cucumbers and cotton for personal consumption and sale. On the lot of their home, they also have a greenhouse. Their monthly cumulative income is 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Cholpon turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy high quality watermelon, cucumber, and cotton seeds for sowing as well as fertilizers for cultivating the land. Cholpon is determined to receive a good harvest which will fundamentally increase her family's capital. Cholpon plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to build one more greenhouse."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1563852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy watermelon, cucumber, and cotton seeds as well as fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jylkol village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-03-23T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-22T00:20:06Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cholpon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":553.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":368.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":553.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":553.13,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":30145.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947194},{"amount":368.75,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":20096.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578343},{"amount":553.12,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":30145.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436141}],"funded_date":"2014-03-25T18:42:36Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":686516,"name":"Marofat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marofat is a kind woman and was born in 1968.

single, and lives with his parents. Aibek has a secondary education. As the main source of income for his family, Aibek practices livestock breeding and crop farming. He started this business 4 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aibek's hard work, he currently has 2 milk cows and 10 sheep on his farm. He also has a greenhouse on the lot of his house. He additionally has a 1.30 hectare plot of land on which he annually grows watermelons, cotton, and corn for personal consumption and sale. His monthly cumulative income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing his business, Aibek turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" He is requesting a loan to buy high quality corn, watermelon, and corn seeds for sowing as well as fertilizers for cultivating the land. Aibek is determined to receive a good harvest which will fundamentally increase his family's capital. Aibek plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

","en":"Mairash is 45 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising five children. Mairash has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Mairash practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 14 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Mairash's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 10 sheep on her farm. She also has a greenhouse on the territory of her house. She additionally has a 1.80 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows corn, watermelons and cotton for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

","en":"Gulzar is 30 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising five children. Gulzar has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Gulzar practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 10 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulzar's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 10 sheep on her farm. She also has a greenhouse on the territory of her home. She additionally has a 1.5 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows watermelons, cotton, and corn for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly cumulative income is 10,000 som (KGS).

A pesar de algunas dificultades que surgieron en el tiempo en que estaba realizando sus estudios, Andr\u00e9s obtendr\u00e1 el t\u00edtulo de Economista en la Universidad Nacional de Colombia en septiembre de 2014, cumpliendo as\u00ed su sue\u00f1o de ser profesional.\nAndr\u00e9s tiene el sue\u00f1o de realizar una maestr\u00eda en el \u00e1rea de Finanzas y para lograrlo necesita solicitar el apoyo de Kiva, puesto que es la \u00fanica opci\u00f3n que tiene en este momento poder cubrir los gastos de ex\u00e1menes de idioma y aplicaci\u00f3n a las universidades. Una vez realice su maestr\u00eda y regrese a Colombia, Andr\u00e9s anhela trabajar en proyectos en el \u00e1rea de Finanzas, donde pueda contribuir al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico del pa\u00eds y as\u00ed poder mejorar la calidad de vida de la poblaci\u00f3n colombiana, gracias al buen manejo y gesti\u00f3n de los recursos, dado que estar\u00e1 en capacidad de contribuir como asesor en los sectores p\u00fablico y privado, para el desarrollo de iniciativas que son trasversales para el pa\u00eds como proyectos de infraestructura que mejoren las condiciones de la sociedad y contribuya a que se acceda de forma completa a los recursos, sobre todo aquellas poblaciones que no tienen esta posibilidad actualmente. Adem\u00e1s de la consecuci\u00f3n de recursos para proyectos empresariales de peque\u00f1a o mediana empresa para apoyar los emprendedores que deseen innovar, pero que no tienen los recursos necesarios para hacerlo.\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia: \nA pesar de que cuento con el apoyo de mi familia para cumplir este sue\u00f1o, mi madre no puede llegar a cubrir gastos tan elevados como estos debido a su limitada situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica. Actualmente, estoy haciendo mi pr\u00e1ctica profesional en el Banco de la Rep\u00fablica y en el pasado he llevado a cabo proyectos con enfoque social, como \u201cCu\u00e9ntanos tu Sue\u00f1o\u201d, un proyecto que ten\u00eda como iniciativa la posibilidad de que cada estudiante de las universidades Nacional y de los Andes pudiera escribir su sue\u00f1o en un sitio determinado, dando una colaboraci\u00f3n monetaria. Con esto, fue posible recaudar fondos para cumplir los sue\u00f1os de tres ni\u00f1as de bajos recursos que de otra forma no habr\u00edan sido posibles. De igual manera, mi educaci\u00f3n siempre ha sido un eslab\u00f3n importante en mi vida y ha sido el motor que me inspira a ser cada d\u00eda mejor.\nKiva ser\u00eda el apoyo que necesito para superar los primeros pasos de este largo camino y el impulso para poder realizar esta maestr\u00eda en el exterior, dado que gracias a Kiva podr\u00eda realizar los estudios que necesito para preparar y presentar no solo mi examen para certificar un segundo idioma, sino tambi\u00e9n el examen de conocimiento que exige la universidad y que me permitir\u00eda cumplir mi proyecto de vida. \nEstoy seguro que gracias a mi excelencia acad\u00e9mica y un gran esfuerzo puedo lograr cumplir las metas que me he trazado para ser mejor persona y poder contribuir al progreso de Colombia. Soy consciente de que la educaci\u00f3n en Colombia es fiel reflejo de las vicisitudes de nuestro pa\u00eds y que existen amplias brechas en el sistema de educaci\u00f3n en t\u00e9rminos de calidad, profundidad y pertinencia que impiden que \u00e9sta cumpla su rol como herramienta transformadora de la sociedad en la que vivimos. Es por eso que he buscado diferentes instituciones, donde ofrecen programas que abordan las finanzas desde diferentes perspectivas, como la importancia de las matem\u00e1ticas como herramienta de an\u00e1lisis (caso MIT), el estudio de caso para entender el fen\u00f3meno desde otros puntos de vista (caso Harvard), la importancia de las finanzas corporativas (caso LSE) o el escenario que re\u00fane elementos pr\u00e1cticos y te\u00f3ricos (caso Princeton). ","en":"Andr\u00e9s is 21 years old and was born in Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia. He is an only child and lives with his mother who currently works at the Banco Caja Social. In spite of certain difficulties that have arisen since he began his studies, Andr\u00e9s will receive a degree in Economics from the National University of Colombia in September 2014, thus realizing his dream of becoming a professional. \r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s has a dream of completing a masters in finance, and in order to do so he needs to take this loan through Kiva, as it's his only option at the moment for covering the costs of language exams and university applications. Once he gets his masters and comes back to Colombia, he looks forward to working on projects in the area of finance, where he can contribute to the economic growth of the country and thus improve the quality of life for Colombians through good management and stewardship of resources. He would be in a position to contribute as a consultant, in both the public and private sectors, to the development of initiatives with transformative power for the country, like infrastructure projects that improve social conditions and make resources more accessible, especially for those populations that don't currently have access. Furthermore, he would help to secure financial resources for small and medium sized businesses and entrepreneurs seeking to innovate, but who don't have the necessary resources to do so. \r\n\r\nHere is his story: \r\n\r\nEven though I have the support of my family, my mother can't manage to cover such high costs as those I'm facing, given her limited means. Currently, I'm completing an internship at the Banco de la Rep\u00fablica and, prior to that, I lead social projects like \"Tell Us Your Dream,\" a project that aims to get every student from the National University and University of the Andes to write down their dream and get financial assistance. This project made it possible to raise funds to achieve the dreams of three girls with limited resources, who wouldn't have been able to do so otherwise. In the same way, my education has always been a critical part of my life and has been the engine that inspires me to be better every day.  \r\n\r\nKiva would be the support I need to make the first steps of this long journey and the motivation to get a masters internationally. Thanks to Kiva, I would be able to take the classes I need to to prepare for not only my language exam, but also the basic knowledge exam required by the university and that would allow me to advance my life project. \r\n\r\nI am confident that thanks to my excellent academic record and with a lot of hard work, I will be able to succeed in meeting the goals that have pushed me to become a better person and be able to contribute to the progress of Colombia. I am aware that the educational system in Colombia is a faithful reflection of the fluctuations of our country and that there are ample gaps in the system, in terms of quality, depth, and applicability, that impede the system's ability to fulfill its role as a transformative tool for the society in which we live. This is why I have looked into different institutions that offer programs that approach finance from various perspectives, such as the importance of mathematics as an analytical tool (like MIT), of case studies to understand a phenomenon from other points of view (like Harvard), the importance of corporate finance (like the London School of Economics), or the integration of practical and theoretical elements (like Princeton). \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1561006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to cover the costs of applying to masters programs in finance.

He is a well-recognized person in his community with an excellent personality. He has a good service-oriented disposition, and he is part of the community development council. He grew up with his mother and grandparents, who worked in agriculture, especially growing basic grains. He remembers that since an early age he accompanied his grandfather to the fields where they cultivated the land, and during those times he acquired knowledge and practice of the principle crops of corn, beans, and sorghum. In this way, he grew up working in agriculture in the morning and studying in the afternoons in the community school. \r\n\r\nHe finished his studies through the ninth grade and no longer could continue studying due to the lack of economic resources, and he decided to start to work in agriculture. With the passing of time, he received a proposal to lend his services as a health volunteer in his community. It was in this way that he started to perform side duties of promoting health in his community. He was a volunteer for three months. Later he started to earn a salary that was of great help for his family which is formed by his wife and their three children, who are already independent and have their own homes. \r\n\r\nCurrently he works in agriculture. Since he finished his working years, according to the code of work and he now has a pension from the government, but he still works in agriculture, an activity that he learned from his grandfather, and to which he dedicated his whole life. He has 40 years of experience doing this activity, and his youngest son joins in this agricultural work. \r\n\r\nThe money will be used for improvements to his home. It will be invested in the purchase of a gate, since his house has a storehouse where he keeps firewood and his harvest. In order to have security in his house, he will order a metal gate for maximum security. \r\n\r\nThe projections that Lelis has for the future are the paying-off of the loan, and making a new request for a greater amount to have plots of diverse crops, since he has always yearned to be a producer of vegetables and to distribute them in the markets of the closest municipalities. He also wishes to support in the raising and education of his grandchildren in order to hake them good people for their family and community.

She works to keep her home as clean as possible because she looks after the health and nutrition of her children and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda grew up with her grandmother, who was a homemaker. Her grandfather worked in agriculture, which he did for his whole life and it served him to provide for his family. With the passage of time, Mar\u00eda got married and she and her husband had 3 children. One daughter and one son live with their partners and the youngest is studying in eighth grade in the local school.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has 35 years of experience in taking care of the household for her family. This is an activity she learned from her grandmother, who was a woman who dedicated her life to this activity and who taught her good principles and values, which have now led to her being a good and successful person for her family and her community. One of her sources of income is the sale of dairy products that she herself makes since her husband owns two milk cows. Her youngest son helps her with this business. He is responsible for caring for the cows. Her main source of income is the remittances that are sent by her children and her husband. \r\n\r\nThe money will be used to buy furniture for the house and to consolidate debt they acquired when they bought the cows.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s plan for the future is to support the education of her son and her grandchildren until they become professionals. She explains that her youngest son wants to study to be an agricultural specialist in the national

Her father-in-law rents a small space where he trades with different types of household goods. \r\n\r\nSusanna has applied for a loan of 3,000 USD to provide financial support for her farm.  As the gathered harvest is big, it is very difficult for the family to organize all of the cultivation and gathering processes without agro machinery.

The representative of the group, Bernadette Edjacho (whose hand is raised in the photo), is 38 years old and has attended some school. She is married to a driver named Salomon. The couple has three children, who all go to school and who are still under their parents' care. Bernadette Edjacho lives with her husband and children.

He is a father to 4 children, he is an exemplary person for his family.\r\n\r\nHe makes his living in agriculture, and has done so from a very young age. Jos\u00e9 remembers with quite some clarity that from 10 years old he accompanied his father to work, carrying his work materials with him: a machete knife, a rasp and his sturdy sandals. It was in this manner that he acquired experience and knowledge about farming which has become his main source of income. Jos\u00e9 is proud of working in this field as it has served him to provide his family with their daily sustenance. His family is made up of his wife who looks after the house and two of his children who are studying in the national high school while his other two children are grown up and live in the United States.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 learned from his father how to perform farming work, who felt very proud of cultivating the land. His day started at 4 am by cultivating the land in a rudimentary fashion with manual tools. The fields in which they grow the crops is at 2 km from their home. Apart from the income that he makes through the sale of his crops, he also sometimes receives money from his two children who are in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be invested in the expansion and improvement of his home as they are only a few months away from winter and Jos\u00e9 needs to extend the roof of his home by building two gutters. This is because last winter the rain was too heavy and the water entered into the house underneath the door. With the loan, Jos\u00e9 will be more at ease in the rainy season to rest at home and they will have a more complete and dignified home.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's plans for the future are to repay the loan and make a new request for a larger value to improve and extend his home and support his children in their education until they become successful professionals, as for the farming, he will diversify the crops and therein have a larger variety of goods."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1561038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to extend the roof of his home in which he will build two gutter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-03-23T09:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-22T09:00:06Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":223.34,"local_amount":223.34,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":223.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216666},{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":26.66,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":26.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818238}],"funded_date":"2014-03-23T15:40:13Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T11:44:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":686628,"name":"Damaris","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Damaris, a 24-year-old married mother of two from Thika, earns a living for her family by operating a retail shop.

She is a hard-working lady who concentrates a lot on tea farming since it\u2019s her sole source of income. \r\n\r\nShe applied for a loan of two million shillings only for buying fertilizers to apply in the tea garden so that the soil fertility can be boosted and she can harvest much which would give her a lot of money as income after selling the harvested tea. Her clients are mainly the tea traders from around her village and the tea factories in the area which buy the green tea for processing. \r\n\r\nHer future hopes include making enough money in the present times so that she can be financially stable in her old age. The unpredictable weather is what challenges her most but she hopes to still make money from farming despite the challenge.

She is married and lives with her family in the small city of Tursun-zoda. Risolat is a kind and sympathetic woman. She is peace-loving and hospitable. She is 43 years old, and has spent the past 10 years of her life farming. In Tajikistan farming and gardening are popular because the climate and environment are conducive to such activities. For centuries Tajiks have raised plants and animals, and today a large part of the population is still involved in agriculture. Risolat's parents farmed, and Risolat also learned this work. Spring has begun and Risolat is getting ready for annual planting. Everything is ready except that she does not have the large amount of cash needed to buy vegetable seeds. This is why she is asking for a loan. Support Risolat.

","en":"Nurilakan is 49 years old, a widow, and has been raising three children alone since her husband's death. Nurilakan has an intermediate education, and to earn the primary income for her family she farms and raises livestock, which she began 16 years ago with 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her tireless work, Nurilakan today owns a milk cow, 15 sheep, a small barn near her house, and a 1.0 hectare plot of land where she grows watermelons, cotton, and corn each year for family use and sale. Her monthly combined income is 8,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her business, Nurilakan came to Bai-Tushum bank for a loan to buy high quality watermelon, cotton, and corn seed for planting, and fertilizer for the soil. Nurilakan intends to have a good harvest, which will certainly grow the family's capital resources. She plans to invest income from the loan into expanding her livestock herd, and she also plants to save for construction of a house.

She has a vocational education and currently works as a nurse at the local hospital. To earn additional income for her family Gulbarchin also farms and raises livestock, which she began 12 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work, she now owns four horses, twenty sheep, and a plot of land where she grows watermelon, cotton, and corn each summer for family use and sale. Her monthly aggregate income is 10,000 (KGS).
