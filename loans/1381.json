Tynarbek has a high school education, and as the primary source of income for his family he farms and raises livestock, which he started 8 years ago with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to his tireless work Tynarbek now owns two milk cows, two sheep, and a barn near the house, and also a plot of land where he grows watermelon, cotton, and corn each year for family use and sale. His total monthly income is 9,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop his business Tynarbek contacted the Bai Tushum bank for a loan to buy high quality melon, cotton, and corn seeds for planting, and fertilizer for the soil. Tynarbek expects to have a good harvest, which will increase the family's capital. He plans to invest earnings from use of the loan into expanding his livestock herd, and also plans to save for purchase of a transport vehicle.

children, between twenty five and two years of age. She is 44 years old and involved in the fishing business, which is her major source of income. She is a hard working lady who works an average of eight hours per day on the fishing business and works in her bar which is her other source of income, when she is off from fishing. She started the business (fishing) in 2003 primarily because it was the main rewarding activity in her area of operation, Kasenyi, which is found in the Kasese district. She started the business with high hopes that she would make enough profit to be able to cater to the needs of her big family. This is the reason why she works so hard to see the business grow, slowly but steadily. She applied for a loan of five hundred thousand shillings only (500,000) to buy new fishing nets so that she can catch more fish and make more profit from the business. Her clients are mainly people who trade in fish and these have supported her since they are a good market for her fish. However, Christina has a challenge of limited capital, since her business is still small and does not generate enough income. She strongly believes that with the UGAFODE facility, if given, she will grow her business and make profits big enough to cater for all needs of her family.  She hopes the profit will pay for school fees for all her children so that they can get quality education and be in a position some day to compete for jobs on the job market, which has always been her dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":1564718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fish nets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-03-23T16:40:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-22T16:40:22Z","loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manweri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Girigori","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gesteves","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hussein","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asanasio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neckson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":8700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1450000},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1450000},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1450000},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1450000},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1450000},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1450001,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1455901,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479277479},{"amount":575,"local_amount":1449998,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1455897.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490974064},{"amount":575,"local_amount":1450001,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1455901.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504415106},{"amount":575,"local_amount":1450001,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1455901,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692690},{"amount":1150,"local_amount":2899999,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2911798.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530922921}],"funded_date":"2014-03-24T08:50:49Z","paid_date":"2014-09-20T10:09:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":684982,"name":"M\u00e1ximo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or M\u00e1ximo tiene 54 a\u00f1os, es  docente y mec\u00e1nico de profesi\u00f3n y su esposa es la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda quien tiene 56 a\u00f1os, los hijos de esta pareja ya son personas mayores, independientes, personas de bien gracias al trabajo de ambos.\nM\u00e1ximo es una persona muy trabajadora, que con mucho esfuerzo ha dado a su familia todo para una vida sin privaciones.

Ahalya runs a grocery shop to help her husband financially. She sells rice, grains, lentils, edible oil, spices, biscuits, soap, detergent, hair oil, etc. in her shop. She has developed a very good relationship with her customers in the village. She likes the fact that she can cater to the needs of the people in her village. \r\n\r\nShe has a plan to make her shop bigger and keep multiple things in her shop to satisfy her customers.

She is married and is nursing two children. The light of her life is her kids and she has hope for them. Eight years ago Barno started her business buying and selling clothing in the market. She has her own trading stall in the local market. She mainly sells women's clothing, as there is greater demand than for men's or children's clothing in the local market.

He is in a relationship and makes a living selling fish during the seasons when there is a lot to catch.  He and his partner have a son, who is still too young to be in school.\r\n\r\nFrancisco has made a living in trade for four years.  The sector he has been most involved with is agriculture.  His father taught him this type of work when he was very young; this was the only way he was able to help his father when he was younger.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work, he also makes a living as a fisherman.  This additional economic activity allows him to generate extra income for his family.  His fisherman business is located seven kilometers away, so he travels by bicycle; there is no other means of transportation where he lives that would get him to work.  His life partner is also involved in this business.  He is in charge of the fishing, and she sells the fish in the community and sometimes also in the nearest municipality.  They work five hours each day.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan from CREDICAMPO in order to buy a fishing net, which he currently does not own.  Having his own fishing net would greatly help him to improve his work as a fisherman.  Buying a canoe would also be helpful, since he would not have to rent one each time that he goes out to fish.  This loan will help him to improve his work and to earn greater profits; he wants to take advantage of his improved means of work.\r\n\r\nHe has many hopes and dreams for his business.  He always wants to continue improving by getting the necessary tools to continue his work.  He dreams of providing better life conditions for his family, and of rebuilding their home with better material.  Their house is currently made of adobe brick and they live on a relative's land.  He wants to buy his own land.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help him to acquire his tools for work, allowing him to earn a higher income and to ultimately provide a better life for his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1562094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a fishing net and canoe.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-03-23T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-22T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Vladimir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":51.85},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":54.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":57.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":63.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.54,"local_amount":41.54,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":41.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216458},{"amount":42.09,"local_amount":42.09,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":42.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817829},{"amount":43.6,"local_amount":43.6,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":43.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243202},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":45.79,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526321},{"amount":48.92,"local_amount":48.92,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":48.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008760},{"amount":87.1,"local_amount":87.1,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":87.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500818},{"amount":88.4,"local_amount":88.4,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":88.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419639},{"amount":93.19,"local_amount":93.19,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":93.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544472},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":109.37,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":109.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595144872}],"funded_date":"2014-03-23T22:53:52Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":685507,"name":"Ferm\u00edn Galileo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ferm\u00edn de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta sexto grado de educaci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 a acompa\u00f1ado su pareja se dedica a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos y en ocasiones se dedica al comercio informal.

para ella el pensamiento es ayudar a las otras personas sin recibir nada a cambio, la oportunidad de estudiar enfermer\u00eda es un paso hacer muchas cosas por la vida de los dem\u00e1s, ya que una

una carrera gratificante, emocionante y sobre todo humana. Por lo tanto, ninguno de los aspectos negativos de esta profesi\u00f3n puede compararse con lo bien que se siente ayudar y aliviar. Es por eso que yudi  decide estudiar enfermer\u00eda para ayudar con la carrera a todas esas personas que necesiten de los cuidados, de la dedicaci\u00f3n, pero sobre todo de esa responsabilidad que debe tener  una enfermera con el paciente porque nada es  m\u00e1s importante que la vida de las personas que toda la unidad m\u00e9dica tiene en las manos. \nEl convenio con kiva le ser\u00eda de gran ayuda, ya que ella se economizar\u00eda un dinero al momento de realizar los pagos y ese dinero lo puede invertir en los gastos que puede tener en la casa o en los gastos que tiene el estudio, ya que muchas veces en dinero no alcanza para poder pagar las mensualidades y tampoco para los gastos que ella tenga. \n","en":"Yudy Yazmin's wish is to study a degree which will offer her many opportunities in life. She also wants to enjoy and dedicate herself to her work. She considered many options and finally decided to study nursing. Her aim is to help other people without receiving anything in return. \r\n\r\nThe opportunity to study nursing is a path towards doing many things for other people's lives. At the end of the day, a nurse can go home feeling confident and calm, knowing that she has done good work. The most gratifying thing about being a nurse is not the salary one receives, but rather having one's hands full of words of gratitude and signs of affection in the eyes of, for example, a mother grateful for her child's wound being cleaned, or the warm expression of a husband who places all of his trust in the nurse while she cares for his pregnant wife, or even the squeeze of a baby's fingers who has still not left its bassinet. \r\n\r\nThese are the moments that make nursing a gratifying, emotional, and above all human career. None of the negative aspects of the profession can compare with how good it feels to help and relieve patients. This is why Yudy decided to study nursing, to help those people who need care and dedication. Nurses have a responsibility to those patients who are under the care of the medical system, as nothing is more important than a person's life.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan will be of great help to her because she will be able to save some money at the time when she needs to pay her tuition. She can invest this money in the household expenses or costs related to her studies, as she often does not have enough money to pay her tuition as well as her other expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1562038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester of tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-23T20:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-22T20:00:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudy Yazmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":152812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202273},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":152812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286414},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":152812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225121}],"funded_date":"2014-03-23T20:13:09Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":687019,"name":"Sary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sary, 50, lives in a rural village in Kampong Cham province\u2019s Memot district, Cambodia.

","en":"Latofat is a modest but very hardworking country woman, who lives in the region of Vose. She is a woman of middle age; she is 35 years old. She has three children, and they are 13, 10 and 6 years old. Two of them attend school, and the third one will start this year. Latofat's husband works with selling food products at the market and at the same time helps his wife with her business. \r\n\r\nLatofat has worked with cattle breeding for a period of 15 years.

This business means a lot to Isonia since she does not have any other source of income. As a woman of vision, she has made the decision to invest in her business by buying a variety of used clothing wholesale in order to satisfy the great demand in the market, which will enable her to improve her sales and revenue.

","en":"Nazgul is 29, married and raising 2 children together with her husband.  She has a university education, and upon graduating, worked in a village library as a librarian and got married sometime thereafter.  She began growing vegetables in 2008 with 25,000 som as startup capital.  Both she and her husband have been growing them on a 0.30-hectare plot of land adjoining their house, planting quick-growing varieties of cucumber, carrots and cabbage.  She typically stocks up on seeds of what are generally recognized to be the best varieties of these plants for each season, sprouts them in a greenhouse and then plants them.  Her vegetables are ready to harvest early in the summer, and she sells them wholesale.  She has several regular buyers for her vegetables.  She sells the vegetables from her plot of land in the summer, and, in the winter, sells carrots and cabbage that she's stored in her cellar in the fall.  Apart from vegetables, Nazgul also has a few animals on her farm (2 dairy cows and 2 sheep).\r\n\r\nTo further develop her farm, Nazgul is seeking a loan from Bai Tushum & Partners to buy high-quality cucumber, carrot and cabbage seeds for the sowing season.  Nazgul is intent on getting a good harvest as this will bolster her family's finances.  She plans on using any extra earnings due to the loan to add more livestock to her farm, as well as to pay for her children's education.  \r\n\r\n

Guljan has a secondary education. Guljan and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 6 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Guljan's hard work, she currently has 2 horses on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). She also cultivates a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows beans. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Guljan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd.

He comments that he was 6 months old when his family left Nicaragua to live elsewhere. At this time there was a recruitment going on for the war and other negative factors. Ten years later they returned and re-established themselves in the community of Guapinol. He started school here and went up to his second year of Secondary school. Then he decided to enter into a Christian ministry. Today he is the minister of the Zareth Church in the Mina el Lim\u00f3n district. There are 40 members in the congregation. \r\n\r\nFour years ago he got married and has a two year old son. He lives in the parsonage. As there is no electricity in the community he would like a loan to buy a solar system and install it in the pastoral house. He could also use it to transfer light to the church and have evening meetings and services for his members.

The three oldest children no longer live in the same house but they do live nearby and have formed their own families. For his entire life he has been doing work in the field, sowing beans, corn, and manioc. With the help of his elder children he farms some land and extracts a good harvest, part of which is sold and the other part is left for personal use. He has used the income obtained to purchase three cows that produce 15 liters of milk a day, which is also consumed at home. Currently, commercial electricity has not yet made it to the community so they continue to live in the dark and get by with candles to provide lighting at night.

For the past year, Peace has been working hard to manage her clothing shop. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Peace has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda to buy more shirts, trousers and skirts. This will help Peace to generate greater profits and to pay house rent. Peace hopes that, in the future, she will be able to open up a library. \r\n\r\nPeace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

In his house he lives with his wife and her son who has been sick since he was small and has to be cared for every day by his wife. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 never studied as his parents raised him working as a farmer and raising livestock. Jos\u00e9 has worked in agriculture since he was 10 years old. His father taught him to grow beans and corn and also mescal. Besides this his family raised native cows which they had to tend before going off to work in the fields. Today he grows corn and beans by himself. He has to pay day labor at certain times of the season as his wife has to tend to the sick son. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is requesting a loan from Credicampo to buy a cow worth $700.

She's married and is a mother of two children, the eldest of whom works alongside her husband on a variety of farming tasks that are somewhat more labor-intensive, such as weeding. The younger of her two children is in the third year of general education at high school. She's a farmer who has been sowing and harvesting vegetables (carrots) for several years and in her area due to the climate and the soil the majority of people work in this activity. The problem isn't competition, it's the various supplies used for necessary care and maintenance. She has over 30 years of experience and learned this job by choice and by ancestry, as well as pottery to provice another source of income for her family and household. The area she farms is on the same property her house was built on, which allows her to tend to it more dilligently, however her target market is 20 kilometers away and she travels by public bus to get there. Her goal is to continue improving her quality of life, increase the amount of land being farmed to be able to harvest more carrots and also sow another type of vegetable. She also plans to help her daughter complete her studies and graduate from high school and subsequently work on a university degree. That's why Cecilia is requesting help to purchase agricultural supplies for the care and protection of her crops and hopes to receive help from KIVA lenders.

He lives with his wife and six children. He has been farming for the past 17 years; his primary sources of income are milk, eggs, maize, and beans, and he has a retail business. In farming, he enjoys feeding chicken and collecting eggs both for family consumption and for selling. His biggest challenges are pests and diseases, drought, and lack of capital.\r\n\r\nRichard chose Juhudi Kilimo because it offers financial support to small-scale farmers. During the training, he learned that microfinance institutions lend money to small-scale farmers at low interest rates. This loan will lead to more income because of an increase in egg production and will enable him to pay his children's school fees and improve living standards for the whole family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1565716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural
