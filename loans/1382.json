The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\r\n\r\nKen is married and has four children. He is an employee with the County government. Both he and his wife have been farming for fifteen years now and they are currently growing maize, bananas, vegetables and beans in their farm.

Thanks to her first loan, she was able to maintain her coffee crops by purchasing coffee plant formula, growth formula, urea, and other supplies to help protect them.  Later on, she was able to harvest good quality coffee beans and generate a very nice profit from her sales.  Paula was able to sell her coffee beans to different buyers and brokers in the area.  She was able to repay her financial commitment in full thanks to the support provided by the different lenders on the Kiva platform and their partnership with the COMIXMUL cooperative.  <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Paula is requesting her second loan, which will be used to buy fertilizers and to pay for labor so that her property can be cleared.  This step is necessary for the plants.  After the plants are pruned the property looks decimated, but this is required maintenance that will bring forth an excellent harvest for this season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1559617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming supplies for her coffee crop and to pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Siguatepeque, Comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-03-24T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-23T05:20:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":15424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762820}],"funded_date":"2014-04-05T03:48:19Z","paid_date":"2015-02-26T10:24:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":687241,"name":"Anush","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anush lives in the village Azatamut in Tavush region.

lives in Kitale.

The people around Kitale have been beekeeping for centuries, and the area is dense with strong bee colonies.\r\n\r\nSammy is married and has six children. He runs a grain-grinding mill. Both he and his wife undertake farming. They have been farming for twenty five years now and they are currently growing maize, bananas, and vegetables and they raise livestock. Sammy is excited about beekeeping as it will provide him with honey and earn him some income, and the bees will help in pollinating their crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Sammy's first loan with Honey Care and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children, develop real estate plots, and improve his life generally.

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. Originally dominated by English settlers in the early 20th century, the region\u2019s farmland was redistributed after independence. This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas, with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\r\n\r\nJoshua is married and has six children. He runs a business selling cereals and livestock. He also has a farm where he grows maize, beans, livestock, trees and an orchard. He has been farming for twenty-five years now. Joshua is excited about beekeeping as it will provide him with honey for medicinal use and the bees will help in pollinating his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Joshua's first loan with Honey Care and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to buy a car and improve his life generally.

She is a mother and the head of the household.  She has an 11 year old daughter.  She is an enterprising woman with many dreams of getting ahead.  She was left an orphan at the age of 13, and life was never easy.  Not until now has she had the opportunity to study and move forward to give her daughter a better life.  As of two months ago, she has not been working and it has become difficult to continue paying for school as the tuition is fairly high now that she is unemployed.  She has lived in Bogota for the past 11 years, and since then she has fought to complete her education.  She lives with her daughter in her brother's home.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the economic situation is not the best, but this institution has given her an opportunity to achieve a higher education at Campo Alto.  Said institution has given her the opportunity to resume her efforts to get ahead and train in the healthcare field, as well as work for a better quality of life for her and her family.  With the hope of helping others with the knowledge she will gain in school, her current worry is how to continue studying if at the moment she does not have the resources to pay her tuition.  She was led to Kiva for help to continue studying."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1562352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

The members of the communal bank have different businesses, including: selling clothes, miniature handicraft products, selling sweets, make-up, bread, making sports goods, making games, and selling electrical appliances.\r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit the small businesses in Frida's group. Frida herself tells us that she joined \"Pro Mujer\" five years ago, following an invitation from a friend who was already a member. Frida currently has a business selling sausages and chips. She tells us that she started this business with the little capital that she had, and following a recommendation from her sister who does the same work.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to increase capital by buying potatoes in bulk. Frida will buy the potatoes in the markets of El Alto city, to later sell at her stall. This work allows Frida to earn a living to support her family. Frida is single and has one son.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what it is that she likes about \"Pro Mujer\", Frida says that she likes the health education and the savings offered by the organisation.\r\n\r\nOne member of the group is missing from the photo. For personal reasons she did not want to appear in the image but is represented by her mother (who is seen standing)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1562390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy potatoes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-03-24T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-23T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":5200,"lender_count":164,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remedios Victoria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ovidio Carlos\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Paula Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frida Petrona\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":35768,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4095.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4172.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4286.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4403.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4504.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4659.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4772.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":595.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":606.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":623.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":640.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":677.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":693.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1202.01,"local_amount":8267.98,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8305.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144931},{"amount":623.19,"local_amount":4286.56,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4306.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838662},{"amount":640.12,"local_amount":4403.04,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4423.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264693},{"amount":654.88,"local_amount":4504.59,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4525.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546796},{"amount":677.47,"local_amount":4659.97,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4681.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530029961},{"amount":693.81,"local_amount":4772.36,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4794.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522189},{"amount":708.52,"local_amount":4873.5,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4895.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655845}],"funded_date":"2014-04-18T19:41:51Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T12:20:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":687511,"name":"Irenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irenia is 40 years old and lives in Dumalinao, Zamboanga Del Sur.

It is composed of women very dedicated to their revenue-generating businesses. They all have been living in the same village for several years and maintain good solidarity and mutual support. Their main work involves small-scale commerce and rainy-season farming.\r\n\r\nMs. Khadidiatou, 42 years old (standing at the far left with a hand raised), is the featured borrower of the group. She is unmarried and the mother of two children, which she supports. She is a vendor of fresh fish, which she purchases on the south coast to resell at her commune's fish market. She enjoys good experience in this domain. \r\n\r\nWith her new loan, she is going to purchase anew 5 cases of fresh fish to resell. \r\n\r\nThe profits will enable her to improve her family's living conditions and to ensure a better education for her children. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5825,"image":{"id":1562262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase anew 5 cases of fresh fish to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2014-03-24T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-23T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":5825,"lender_count":173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khadidiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Astou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta Badji","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seynabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dieneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diarietou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta Badji","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marietou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hymelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sirre","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":2760000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2760000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5825,"local_amount":2760000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2763025.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529999431}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T15:44:55Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T10:58:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":687549,"name":"Celestina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celestina is a farmer from San Miguel, Bohol.

She needed to raise and support her children, so Gulnara decided take her home and her financial responsibilities into her own hands. Her children helped her with this as well. Her eldest son is working abroad in Russia and sends back money home when the need arises. Her middle son lives and works in the capital of Kyrgyzstan and also helps her financially. Gulnara has been raising cattle since 1995. She started this business with 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work and persistence, she currently makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS). Gulnara has 2 milk cows, 1 bull calf, 11 sheep and 2 goats on her farm. She has all of the conditions necessary for housing cattle. For the purpose of increasing the size of her herd, Gulnara turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows for future breeding. Gulnara plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to throw a wedding reception for her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1567239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Svetlaya Polyana village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-03-24T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-23T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":120.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":368.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":921.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":368.75,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":20094.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579488973},{"amount":179.52,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10047.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.86,"payment_id":624798902},{"amount":805.87,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50235.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":116,"payment_id":730933263}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T22:07:46Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:56:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":685645,"name":"Ruben Dario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Rub\u00e9n es originario de Estel\u00ed.

Cholponay has a secondary education. Cholponay and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 14 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Cholponay's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 1 calf, and 1 heifer on her farm. Her monthly income is 17,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk. She also cultivates a 0.52 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows potatoes and corn. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Cholponay turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. After purchasing the cattle, they will be located on her farm. In the summer, they will be under the care of a shepherd. Cholponay plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to make home repairs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1567255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulbahor village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-03-24T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-23T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cholponay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33000},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":33000},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":610.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":610.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":629}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":610.5,"local_amount":33000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-19T09:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":33267.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463184},{"amount":610.5,"local_amount":33000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":33267.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579488974},{"amount":590.89,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":34275.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.11,"payment_id":636161019}],"funded_date":"2014-04-18T21:23:36Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":687557,"name":"Krouch's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Krouch, 53, is a mother of six children.

a widowed mother of two children. As the breadwinner in the family, she farms cassava and rice as her main business. Her first loan was the original loan for Thaem with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She has fully paid back her past loan wisely and it has enabled her to support her business on time. \r\n\r\nNow, she leads a group of two to get a new loan.

raising five children. Marina has a secondary-specialized education. Marina and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 6 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Marina's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows on her farm, as well as a 1.44 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows beans. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. Her monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Marina turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd.

Like the other members of the group, she hopes that this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso will help her make her business sustainable.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1564382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy produce.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"District de Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-03-24T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-23T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koro                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assitan                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan         Foun\u00e8   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bata                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":283.34,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-24T09:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134396.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468046047},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":134396.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263939},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":134396.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960832},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":134396.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677180},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":134396.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676845},{"amount":283.34,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":134396.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209393}],"funded_date":"2014-03-27T14:38:19Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:32:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lucy  Knight","image":null}},{"id":686565,"name":"Modou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":" Modou, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 38 ans, s\u2019active dans le commerce de ciment depuis 6 ans maintenant.

old, married, and together with her husband, is raising six children. Bakbubu has a secondary-specialized education. She graduated from a technical college and has a payroll accounting degree. Her professional career began as a kindergarten supervisor. Then she worked for many years as a payroll accountant. She is currently retired. Bakbubu is very responsible, gregarious and cheerful by nature. Bakbubu and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 16 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bakbubu's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 3 calves and 40 sheep on her farm, as well as a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows beans and potatoes. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Bakbubu turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy horses to increase the size of her herd. Bakbubu plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to make home

","en":"Kanyshay is 52 years old, a widow, and is raising four children. After the death of her husband, Kanyshay was not able to get over the loss of her significant other for a long time. She needed to raise and support her children, so Kanyshay decided take her home and her financial responsibilities into her own hands. Kanyshay has been raising cattle since 1990. She started this business with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work and persistence, she currently makes a monthly income of 20,000 som (KGS). Kanyshay has 4 milk cows on her farm, as well as a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows clover. For the purpose of increasing the size of her herd, Kanyshay turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows for future breeding. Kanyshay plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to build a new barn for housing her cattle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1567413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Elnura has a secondary-specialized education. She graduated from a vocational college and has a head cashier degree. Her professional career began in a bank, then she worked as a cashier at a train station. Now she works as a dish washer in a private cafe. Elnura is very responsible, gregarious and cheerful by nature. Elnura and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 15 years ago with 7,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Elnura's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 1 calf, 1 horse and 8 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). She also cultivates a 0.90 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows beans, and potatoes. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Elnura turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy calves to increase the size of her herd. Elnura plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to expand the barn where she houses her

Munira has a secondary-specialized education. She graduated from a medical college and has a nursing degree. Her professional career began in a private pharmacy, then she got married but continued to work. Munira is very responsible, gregarious and cheerful by nature. Her husband works as an electrician. Additionally, Munira and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 8 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Munira's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 30 and 3 horses on her farm. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). She also cultivates a 3.22 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows potatoes, barley, and perennial grasses. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Munira turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy bull calves to increase the size of her herd. After purchasing the cattle, they will be located on her farm. In the summer, they will be under the care of a shepherd.

His father taught him to work and defend himself. \r\n\r\nMario and his father work in growing staple crops as well as raising some cattle which he has with his father. The harvest generates good income as it always goes well; they sell the harvest to merchants who come to the community to buy it. Thanks to his father\u2019s help and his efforts nowadays he has his own things such as a couple of acres of land and 3 cows. He says he wants to go little by little doing his things so that when he has a family he can offer them something. \r\n\r\nThis community doesn\u2019t have electric power and this is why he wants this loan, to purchase a solar power system and put it in his house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1562418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

His Sistema Biobolsa has an anaerobic reactor that will process the manure, resulting in a number of benefits. The first product generated by the reactor is renewable, methane-rich biogas. This fuel will help Abraham displace the propane and firewood he and his family currently use to cook and to heat bathwater, helping him save money and the environment. The reactor also produces a rich, potent soil amendment, allowing Abraham to improve his soils without having to spend on costly petroleum-based fertilizers. Abraham will also reduce his farm's environmental impact while concurrenly improving hygiene.

The income from her business is helping to pay for her family's everyday household expenses. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for another 35,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and to maintain their jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nCrisales dreams to expand her business and hopes to give her children a good life and education. Every week, she meets with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work. At the meetings, she can also draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\nFootnote: Interestingly, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.
