Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nEmma dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

hospitality.  She lives in the El Recreo neighborhood with her mother, Olga Lucia, who sells hardware products.  Nataly Vanessa's mother is the one who has been seeing to her education and, as far as possible, has been the one who has supported her so she could continue to prepare herself academically so that in the future she can help financially with any necessities they might have; they haven't had any support with basic necessities from Nataly Vannesa's biological father.\r\n\r\nNataly Vanessa was studying at the Southern Institute of Technology.  She's stresses that she was on the career track there so she could become a responsible person, committed to the tasks assigned to her. One of her goals is to be able to study for a career in psychology because she feels that she can help people who have particular behavioral problems caused by violent situations or other circumstances. That would be her ideal.  However, for now it's not possible for her mother to pay for a professional-level degree. The costs involved are too high for her to manage, so they didn't go that route.  \r\n\r\nThey decided to have Nataly Vanessa register at Campo Alto to study for a Hospitality Administrative Assistant technical degree. They told her that by getting a degree from the Southern Institute of Technology she would have the benefit of studying for a degree that would live up to her expectations. Plus, she'd be paying a more affordable monthly fee until she finishes up and gets the degree. \r\n\r\nIdeally, Nataly Vanessa will be able to finish her studies and get the aforementioned technical degree. She hopes that Kiva will be able to help her out and be sensitive to the financial situation she and her mother are going through; she had never budgeted for the increase in the monthly expenses. \r\nNataly Vanessa is giving the highest attention and making the most valuable contribution to her situation.  Education is the most important part of becoming a person starting a productive career, and she sees herself as a future professional.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1562451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of college.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-25T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-24T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nataly Vannesa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":152812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882885},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":152812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202279},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":152812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286420},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":152812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225127}],"funded_date":"2014-03-25T03:15:13Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":687177,"name":"Maa Dharani Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Banita is 21 years old, married and has four children.

He is a 53-year-old man who is in a solid common-law relationship with his wife.  She does not work, but she spends her time at home and helps with the business.  They have eight children, with the oldest being 28 and the youngest being 11.  <br \/><br \/>Sr. Julio and his wife raise pigs.  When they were younger, both of them engaged in this type of work with their parents.  Julio works approximately 10 hours a day at his business and at a farm where he provides his services.

Nargiza sells nuts and milk products locally and has her own costumers. She is hard-worker, who takes much effort in reaching her goal, to ensure her family in good living condition. Nargiza also has small stationary store near the village school and generates some income. 5 years ago Nargiza was involved in making lemonade in glass bottles and couldn't compete with the lemonade output in plastic bottles.

Zinalkan has a secondary education. She and her husband have been engaged in agriculture since 1996, with a livestock purchase of 15,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Zinalkan currently has on her homestead: two dairy cows, one steer, 20 sheep, and two horses. Monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk. She also works 1.60 hectares of land, where she mainly grows potatoes, cultivates cereals and sainfoin. <br \/><br \/>The resulting crop will be sold to wholesalers. With the aim of further developing her homestead, Zinalkan turned to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan - to purchase cows for increasing her livestock count. Zinalkan plans to invest income from the loan in further propagating the count of domestic animals, and plans to save money to purchase an apartment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1568668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Wahba is a university graduate but, because of the hard conditions in the country, she couldn't find a job. Despite her miserable condition, she didn't surrender to her condition, but she decided to help her husband in the expenses of the family. \r\n\r\nWahba started up her business for two years as a door-to-door seller, selling simple goods. Now, she sells women's clothes in her area, but this business needs to a lot of money in order to purchase more clothes. Her money, which she accumulates, is not enough for that and most of what she earns goes to the expenses of her family. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Wahba applied for a loan of YER 30,000 from AMB in order to purchase more women's clothes and other goods. Wahba looks forward to expanding her business through buying accessories, makeup, incense, perfumes, and many kinds of clothes. Her dream is to support her family with a lot of money.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1567429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase many kinds of clothes and other goods to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"hodeidah","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-03-25T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-24T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wahba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aysha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11027},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10997},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10997},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10997},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10997},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10997},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10997},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10997},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10997},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10997}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.63,"local_amount":11027,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":11307.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479037913},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490734484},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504162179},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517445963},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529929891},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542422241},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561559867},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579468895},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595075773},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":10997,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11276.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610478331}],"funded_date":"2014-03-31T14:18:57Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:04:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":688093,"name":"Tr\u00f2n","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tr\u00f2n operates a food stall\/restaurant selling\u00a0fish.

Matlyuba has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Matlyuba practices crop farming. She started this business 15 years ago with 6,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Matlyuba's hard work, she currently has a 0.51 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows potatoes, cotton and vegetables for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

I was born and raised in Tamayo in Bahoruco province, and I am one of four siblings. I live with my parents. My father works in the Ministry of Agriculture and my mother is a homemaker. Both my parents have gone to great lengths to give us a good education and to instill good vales in us. I want to go to the Central Eastern University (UCE) to study.  \r\n\r\nI am interested in studying medicine because I enjoy it, and I would like to become a doctor to be able to help my family and my community. Previously, I took the core subjects at another college, but due to family reasons I had to stop going. I want to have the opportunity to finish my degree. This is my goal so that I can keep moving forward and developing myself in the future. If I do not qualify for this loan, I will not be able to go to college and it would change my life completely because I won't be able to help out my parents. My goal is to become a good doctor and to move forward to help out my parents and my siblings and to be an example for them. Personally, I want to become a great professional and to work with passion, commitment and professionalism helping those who cannot afford quality health services. My goal is to be able to give personalized attention to anyone who needs is, irrespective of their financial situation. I would love to specialize in pediatrics and to work in the Robert Reid Cabral Hospital, helping the children in need

An energetic entrepreneur, she is 45 years old, the mother of eight children (all students), and married to a taxi driver. This client is a vendor of various clothing. She displays her merchandise at a market in town. She started her business with initial capital from her husband. Later on, she benefited from a loan from the microfinance institution Hekima. She has been in this business for ten years. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to purchase skirts, boubous [traditional long flowing outfits], short-sleeved shirts, etc. Thus, she would like to build a house and provide education and food for her children. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, she thanks Hekima very much for its support of small-scale entrepreneurs excluded from the traditional banking system, especially during this difficult period post-conflict in the country's east. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7275,"image":{"id":1567540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase skirts, boubous, short-sleeved shirts, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

His father made his living working in restaurants, and Daniel has worked for hotels and restaurants all over San Diego. As a first-generation college student, Daniel pursued a business degree with a background in accounting and economics at San Diego State University, eventually transferring to National University, where he had more flexibility to work while earning his degree. \n\nLast year, Daniel\u2019s brother-in-law, who has been a sushi chef for over 15 years, approached him with an opportunity to partner in starting a sushi business. Daniel happily accepted, and they launched Sushi Uno, a pop-up food vendor serving fresh sushi at outdoor farmers\u2019 markets and festivals. The combination of his years of business experience and his new partner's talent as a sushi chef enabled their fledgling business to slowly gain a loyal following at the two farmers\u2019 markets where they regularly sell. \n\t\nSushi Uno strives to produce the highest quality products possible while keeping it affordable. They buy their fish fresh from Catalina Offshore, a company that is ethical and sustainable, and once their food truck is up and running, Sushi Uno aims to be fully organic. \n\n\u201cOur sushi is something different,\u201d said Daniel. \u201cWe want to not only offer the freshest fish available to our customers, but also put our own Mexican twist on it.\u201d\n\nThis $10,000 Kiva loan will enable Sushi Uno to go mobile by starting a sushi food truck. They plan to renovate a truck, as well as pay for the supplementary costs, such as permits and licenses. Daniel has done his research on food trucks in the area and sees a lot of room for their unique business. He plans to focus on serving customers outside of breweries, while also maintaining their interest in the San Diego farmers\u2019 markets scene. With a focus on customer service and providing top quality food at affordable prices, Daniel wants to build a top-notch brand while also giving back to the community.\n\t\nDaniel is committed to this business and is pictured above in the center working alongside his employees, Azucena and Bertin. He hopes that diversifying his business revenue will allow him to go full-time at Sushi Uno, and eventually allow him to hire other relatives. \n\t\nCheck out their Square website at:

This is 50-year-old Sonnie from Waterloo Western rural area in Freetown. She is married with 6 children.

She works at the business eight hours per day and seven days per week. Sonnie says that the main challenge to her business is the poor road network within her operation area.\r\n\r\nSonnie has requested a loan to purchase more charcoal to expand her business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and repay her loan. In the future, she plans to open a big food store.

The group was formed in February 2012 with an aim of pooling members' funds to enable them start up a small business. They opened a stall to sell charcoal and have been successfully running this small business since April 2012. Individual members share the profits from this business. They took their first loan to purchase energy-saving cook stoves to sell concurrently with the charcoal. This was successful and they were able to fully pay back their loan. As a result, other women from Murang'a county have been able to take advantage of energy-saving cook stoves. This has created more awareness and cook stoves are in high demand in the region. The group has taken a second loan to purchase more cook stoves to meet the demand from the region. Part of the loan will also be used to purchase solar lamps as a introductory product in this region.The loan will be paid in 12 months.

From the past many days his rickshaw is not working properly because of regular uses. He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of new rickshaw.

From the past many days his rickshaw is not working properly because of which he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing rickshaw. Therefore Zohra has requested for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

This is how he started to build up his experience.  \r\n\r\nSeeing that the tricycle service was quite a profitable business, Julio began to look into how to get a tricycle concession and then buy the concession and the tricycle so he could be the boss of his own business. This is how he got his tricycle 5 years ago. He tells us that he really likes his work. As you can see in the photo he is transporting one of his customers and to date he has a regular clientele of around 15 people. \r\n\r\nHis goal is to eventually buy two more tricycles with the help

The bar business is a busy one, especially in the evenings and this boosts his income. \n\nHis customers are mainly cattle traders in the area and they have supported him greatly since they give him a ready market for the cows.  Pius hopes to grow the business so that he can make greater sales and get more profits.  Pius would like to use the loan money, amounting to one million shillings, to buy more cows for trade so that he can grow his business.  However, Pius has a challenge of inadequate land for grazing cattle and this affects his business since he can't have many cows on the relatively small piece of land that he has, but he hopes to overcome this by buying land from the accumulated profits from the business.Pius is pictured(middle) standing in the plantation with his wife and the UGAFODE
