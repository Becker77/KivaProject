He was worried for many days about how to abstain from paying a daily fare, so he decided to buy his own rickshaw. \r\n\r\nShabana has been making savings for many days to buy a new auto rickshaw for her husband, but at the time of purchasing was short some money. Therefore, Shabana has requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy a new rickshaw, with the contribution of her savings. She hopes that now her husband will not have any need to pay daily fare; this will become the cause of an increase in income. \r\n\r\nShabana hopes that now her husband will be able to have more income because now he will not pay daily fare to anyone.

This is her fourth loan with the BRAC. She is an old member, and has been taking loans according to the needs of her family. She belongs to a poor family and it is very difficult for her to fulfil all the household expenses with her poor earnings. \r\n\r\nIn fact, her husband is a hawker by profession: he sells and purchases engine oils by bicycle. His practice is to buy used engine oil from different workshops then sell it to the refinery factories. He wants to buy large quantities of engine oil for reselling so that he can generate a reasonable income for the family so they can overcome poverty. Therefore, Ruqia has requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more quantities of used engine oil. She is very impressed with this honorable support.

She owns a small business that sells beauty products to the ladies of her hometown by door to door. She roams from door to door to offer products in her community by lifting the basket of beauty products over her head. She purchases local cosmetic products such as nail polish, lipstick, talcum powders, face powder, etc. from the market at a low price and sells them on at a high price. She wants to involve her husband in this business also, so he can offer these products to retailers. But she does not have cash in hand to buy beauty products for her husband.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Nasreen has requested a loan so she can buy more quantities of cosmetics for her husband to resell to retailers. She wishes for a bright future for her children and dreams of providing a better education for them.

He has been running a small general store for many years. Earlier he was selling only general store items so that he could easily bear the household expenses. But with the inflation in household expenses, he decided to offer fruits as well. \r\n\r\nHis shop is situated in a populated area and lots of customers are available here, to whom he can offer miscellaneous items. He wants to offer all those products which are necessary and consumable in daily usage. A few days ago he started to offer fresh fruits, due to offering additional inventory. This impacts positively on his net income, but does not remain as sufficient cash in hand to buy inventory for the general store. He wants to fully stock his general store again by purchasing inventory such as bread, jam, milk, cookies, butter, sandwiches, patties etc. But the major problem is the lack of availability of funds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Abdul Qayoom has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan so that he can buy inventory such as bread, jam, milk, cookies, butter, sandwiches, patties and additional fruits. He is very glad after taking this loan and hopeful that he will be successful in fulfilling each request for any item, and abstain from the disappointment of his customers. In this way, he will be able to generate maximum profit from the sale of additional inventory. He is very thankful to Kiva and the field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

He is married and recently started a clothing business near his hometown. Now this garment shop is the only single source of income for his family, which is the reason he devotes all of his all time to the garment shop.\r\n \r\nHis shop is situated under the garment market and there are a lot of competitors in the market. Due to this competition, it is very difficult to convince customers to pay a high price. This competition becomes the cause of low sales and requires more effort as well. He has to maintain the latest designs, rates and delightful colors of clothing in the shop on a daily basis so that he can maintain the rate of sales.\r\n\r\nNow the major problem is that the summer season is about to start and he does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy clothing for the summer season. If he could not replace the winter season\u2019s clothing with the summer season, then it might be highly affect his sales. He does not want to reduce his sales and monthly income. Therefore, M. Tayab has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan to buy the summer season clothing. M.

Zohra's husband wants to purchase different kinds of commodities such as rice, sugar, tea bags, milk and other consumer items for his business.  But due to financial constraints, he is not in a suitable position to buy all these products to resell. Therefore, Zohra has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her husband to buy all these commodities and help him to earn the maximum profitable income to manage his household and business. \r\n\r\nZohra is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

He has been running this enterprise from many years and getting a lot of experience in the business. He is the sole earner for his entire family. He cares for his family because his father has grown old and his sibling is still too young. He does not have any other source of income except this enterprise. There has been a rapid increase in his household expenses and an increase in inflation. Therefore, he wants to grow his income as well. In fact he wants to provide a higher education to his sibling, which seems impossible in the absence of a healthy source of income. His current business is proving insufficient for generating the desired income to meet his household expenses and to bear the educational expenses of his sibling.\r\n \r\nHe wants to grow his business so he can prove himself a good son by providing a better living standard and higher education to his sibling. However, he is unable to grow his business without some capital. Therefore, M. Ahmed has requested a Kiva loan through BRAC Pakistan so he can buy more burners, ovens, cylinders, etc. for reselling.

For 13 years he's lived there after being displaced by Hurricane Mitch from where he used to live in the hills of El Guayabo, where the rainfall caused his house to collapse. Ever since, his life has changed by the grace of God because he found work as a street cleaning operator in the aforementioned municipality. In spite of making very little he's satisfied that he puts food on his household's table. Jose Francisco currently needs a loan to purchase medication and have exams done, for the purpose of improving his wife's health. With this purpose in mind he went to the Ceprodel office to seek financing from Kiva lenders, because he knows they support the most needy and that's just the situation he finds himself in because the little he makes barely suffices for food. He has faith in God that they will finance his loan so his wife's health can improve."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1553592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical

He is involved in his own business to have a regular income for the family. He is involved in making and selling furniture, such as single beds and tables. He started this business from a young age, now he has grown old and weak, as well.  \r\n\r\nToday, Nasreen's husband has many regular customers and he also takes orders from other cities. This business yields a good income for her husband, but her family's needs are increasing day by day and she needs more money to afford household expenses. \r\n\r\nNow, Nasreen wants to buy more raw materials for her husband to make furniture in order to expand the business. This is why she came to BRAC Pakistan and she wishes to obtain a loan, so that her husband can buy raw materials, such as chip boards, timbers, and planks for marking furniture. She hopes that this loan will prove beneficial and productive for his business, as well as for his family.\r\n\r\nNasreen gives thanks to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan, for this honorable

With the goal of bolstering their working capital, the group members have decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their third solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Neh (the one standing on the far right in the photo)  is a well-known vendor of condiments (onions, pasta, shallots, Maggi cubes, tomato paste etc). She plans to use her loan to buy wholesale in Bamako 10 boxes of tomato paste, five bags of shallots, 10 bags of onions, 15 packs of pasta, eight basket of tomatoes and seven cartons of Maggi cubes. She sells retail in Kanadjiguila, as a street vendor, mainly to female customers. Thanks to this loan, Mrs. Neth plans to earn an average monthly revenue of 85,000 West African francs, which will be used to reinvest in her business and cover some minor household expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1567588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy condiments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kanadjiguila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-03-26T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-25T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bamousso                           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia\t         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neh                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":529.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":251583.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263959},{"amount":529.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T09:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":251583.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479263960},{"amount":529.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":251583.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960852},{"amount":529.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":251583.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677205},{"amount":529.16,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":251583.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676864},{"amount":529.16,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":251583.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209414}],"funded_date":"2014-04-02T15:10:48Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:34:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":686186,"name":"Los Alamos De La Estacion Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cLOS ALAMOS DE LA ESTACION\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Urcos, perteneciente a la provincia de Quispicanchis y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Her husband is a vegetable seller by profession. He sells vegetables like potatoes, onions, garlic, and tomatoes. He is only responsible for feeding the entire family and managing the household. Abida's husband needs to purchase different types of vegetables to resell so that he can increase the size of his business, improve his sales growth, and earn maximum profit. But due to an unfavorable financial position, he is not in a condition to purchase vegetables for his business. Therefore Abida has applied for a Kiva loan from field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase the above items for business purposes. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1561729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits

To increase their stock-in-trade, the group decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first group loan cycle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Balengue (the woman sitting in the second position from right to left in the photo) is a great vendor of vegetables (lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers). She intends to use her loan to buy three baskets of tomatoes, three baskets of cucumbers, and 15 baskets of lettuce in Bamako. Retail sales are conducted in Kanadjiguila to a clientele composed mostly of women.\r\n\r\nMrs. Balengue expects this loan will generate an average monthly profit of 50,000 CFA francs, to be reinvested in the business and used to meet small household needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1567660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Her brother Juan Diego is 11 years old and he is in fifth grade, and her youngest sister Sol Mariana is 4 years old and she is in Kindergarten. Laura Camila studies in \" Manuela Beltran\" school in the morning schedule, and she is in 10th grade, a very good student, who is in one of the first places of the school. They live in a rented apartment. Her father is musician and entertainer. He works during the week as a music tutor to private students and some hours at private schools. On the weekends he has occasional events in which he sings or plays piano or works in entertainment events. The family's financial situation is a little difficult and not very stable since the father does not have a fixed job and the mother is neither a physical nor a financial presence in the life of the children. The father takes the mother's place and he works very hard to earn money to feed the children, pay the utilities, rent, school supplies, uniforms, clothing, transportation and all other household expenses. He also works hard to teach them many things: love of life, order, discipline, to be hardworking and set goals even when they cost a lot of sacrifice and effort. Since Laura was very young her dad saw her tendency to help, to be inquisitive, very sure of herself; to ask, talk and relate to others without problems; to not fear or be repulsed by blood or wounds. She talked about the investigations and unresolved homicides. She dreamed of being a criminal investigator. When she discovered there was an accredited and prestigious institute where this profession existed in Colombia, she got very excited, and her dad decided to support her to study in the Institute CAMPO ALTO. He made her see this would be a difficult challenge, studying till late at night, getting up early and continue with her personal obligations as older sibling in her home, and face this challenge with responsibility and maturity. Even when there was no money, he would find the means to pay the institute because he wants to see his daughter advance so that she has more opportunities in life. She had to work hard to meet her school's obligations, and in the institute she promised to keep her good grades and be one of the best students and also be a better human being. In order to grow intellectually and have better opportunities in life, and to support her family in a short future, she wants to continue with her studies. She requests KIVA support so that her father can keep up with the payment of the monthly tuition and his daughter does not miss the chance of specializing in this field and later become a successful professional.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1564789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay a semester's tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-26T14:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-25T14:10:13Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura Camila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":151047.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882888},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":151047.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202291},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":151047.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286432},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":151047.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225139}],"funded_date":"2014-03-26T15:58:22Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Mueller","image":null}},{"id":686752,"name":"Lisset Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lisset es una joven de 32 a\u00f1os, honrada, trabajadora y con muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n,  soltera, con 2 hijos.

She wants to expand her inventory in the store and so she is applying for a loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to buy items like sugar, rice, noodles, beans, oil, and a variety of other things such as snackfoods.\r\n\r\nMaria is happy to be a member of Friendship Bridge because, besides having the opportunity to secure a loan, she expands her knowledge with the educational trainings offered at the monthly meetings by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. In a recent meeting, Maria, along with the other ladies in her group, learned about the use of medicinal plants. The group also gains valuable and useful information about effective business practices and indebtedness so that they can be smart and successful businesswomen.\r\n\r\nThe ladies have recently learned about Kiva and are aware of the kind and generous investors who read about them and their dreams. The small loans combined with the educational trainings are so beneficial to these women. Maria and the nine Trust Bank members of \u201cBendici\u00f3n Barrio de la Paz\" face a brighter and more empowered future which will benefit not only them but their families and their community as well!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":1566198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Because the barn that Gohar owns isn't in good conditions she isn't able to keep more livestock. So, by applying for this loan Gohar asks financial support of USD 3000 to be able to make improvements in her farm.

They applied for a loan of YER 100,000 from Al-Amal Microfinance Bank (AMB).\r\n\r\nSalamah is a leader of the group. She is a 33-year-old widow, living with her three children in a poor family. Although she is an uneducated woman, she is very dynamic and active. After the death of her husband, she became the sole breadwinner of her family. The condition of her family became more miserable, so she decided to take care of her children. \r\n\r\nThree years ago, Salamah started up her business as a door-to-door seller. She began selling incense, perfumes, accessories, and other simple goods. From this humble business, she earned a good profit, and she decided to continue. Since most of what she earns goes to cover family expenses, she applied for a loan of YER 30,000 from AMB in order to purchase more incense, perfumes, and other goods.\r\n\r\nSalamah looks forward to opening a small store to sell incense and perfumes.

employer, Concept One Staffing. During my leave, the owner of Concept One Staffing decided to close the industrial side of his company and expand more of his efforts towards the Las Vegas office and that market. Unfortunately, the industrial division was where I was focused and from where most of my income was generated, and with a new baby, travel to Las Vegas did not seem realistic.\r\n\r\nSo the decision was made to leave Concept One and start my own staffing solutions company. Since most of Concept One's clients were generated through me, it was not hard to convince them to follow me to the new company, especially since Concept One was redirecting its business model to exclude servicing them.\r\n\r\nThe first year was tough, with a new baby and growing a business, but 2005 proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that I made the right decision for myself and my family. Express Services Group not only serves several of my original clients, but has expanded its market to include many new companies.\r\n\r\nI love what I do. Every day when I put people to work, people who really need to provide for their families, it makes all the struggles to get where I am today worth it. As my daughter gets older each year, she understands more about how important what I do is and gives her a great background in work ethics. With a single working mom, it is very important for her to realize how important what we do is and what it means to families all over the country.\r\n\r\nThere have been many challenges through the last few years. The economy and mass layoffs have changed the entire landscape of my life and business. I now have learned to do what I do without most of the bells and whistles of my industry. Sometimes it works against me because some larger companies want to work with agencies that have all those things. But what I offer is personal and detail-oriented service, something the larger companies have a very hard time providing. I work with small to middle-sized local businesses, helping them grow their companies; unfortunately those companies do not have deep pockets, so it's more of a labor of love with enough profit to live on, but not much more. Hopefully the future economy will be better, and my business will continue to grow and flourish.\r\n\r\nI will be using the Kiva loan to help with some current operational bills that I need to catch up on. During the holidays, business slowed down a bit and workers compensation rates increased across the board, and things got really tough. Since then, business has improved by 80% at least, and while I am making enough now, making up for the amounts owed is causing a major drain on moving forward.\r\n\r\nI look forward to a great year. I plan on trying to explore a couple of new markets to expand my base, and maybe invest in a sales-generating firm to assist me with bringing on new clients.\r\n\r\nWhat I love the most about my business is putting people to work and the impact on everyone, from every walk of life. More people working means a stronger economy for all. It means families have food and shelter; it means our children can go to college and be part of the next working generation. This company means everything to me, and I will do everything in my power to keep these doors open and keep putting people to work.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1888.95,"image":{"id":1568242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Kiva

Munara has a secondary education. She and her husband are involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Munara's hard work, today her business contains 5 dairy cows, 15 sheep and 2 horses. The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS). She also works on 7.58 hectares of land, where she primarily grows barley.  The obtained harvest is sold to wholesale distributors.  In order to further develop her business, Munara requested a loan from the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" to buy cows to increase livestock headcount. Munara plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money for holding a wedding celebration for her

","en":"Aitilla is 62 years old, a widow and raised her children alone after her husband's death.   All of the children are now independent and live separately.  Aitilla has a secondary education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, Aitilla is involved in animal husbandry, having started 7 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 12,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aitilla's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 calf and 15 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Aitilla requested a loan from the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" to buy a calf to increase livestock headcount. Aitilla plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock

years old, managed to study as far as ninth grade. After this she stopped going to school because of her parents' financial situation. She later married and began working with her husband, buying and selling vegetables and fish. Her four children go to the local primary school and are dependent on her. \r\n\r\nFrom a young age she worked with her mother, selling fresh fish and vegetables, so when she got married it was not difficult to do this.

With great effort by her parents, she was able to study until the 4th grade.  Since the economy wasn't very good, they were not able to let her keep studying.  <br \/><br \/>As the years passed, she got married.  With much effort and work, they were able to build a house and have 3 children.  But her husband abandoned her with her young children.  With great effort and work, she has sent them to school.  They are now in the 6th and 7th grades, and her oldest daughter is already in a relationship.<br \/><br \/>From a very young age, Milagro has spent her time working in the field, farming, and housekeeping.  She used to help her father, who used to make his living farming, and her mother to support and feed the family.

Abdasbek has a secondary education. At the present time, he works as a plumber at a school.  To provide a supplementary income for his family, Abdasbek and his wife are involved in animal husbandry, having started 6 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Abdasbek's hard work, today his business contains 1 dairy cow, 10 sheep and 1 calf. The monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Abdasbek requested a loan from the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" to buy calves to increase livestock headcount. Abdasbek plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a kitchen."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1569631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

To provide the primary source of income for her family, Aiperi is involved in animal husbandry, having started 4 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aiperi's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow and 2 calves. The monthly income amounts to 11,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Aiperi requested a loan from the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" to buy sheep to increase livestock headcount.
