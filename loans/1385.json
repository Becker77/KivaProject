Maria is one of the members. She is 32 years of age and has four children who range in age from nearly two years to eleven years. They are the joy of her life and she works hard to support them. Maria sells food three times per week in a space just outside of her house. In this way, she can also care for her small children. Maria plans to continue with her current business but wants to increase her menu by selling French fries. She is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge which she will use to purchase a cart for producing the fries and buy a cylinder of propane gas in order to cook them.\n\nEach Trust Bank of Friendship Bridge meets on a monthly basis. The ladies make payments on their loans and also receive valuable educational trainings on subjects like personal hygiene and nutrition, self-esteem and women\u2019s identity, effective business practices and money management as well as budgeting.

They live together in Santo Domingo, a very commercial and productive city with nice weather. The city is also known for being the location of the Tsachila ethnic, for which the city is named after. \r\n\r\nMaria is a hard-working woman who set up a business to support her daughter. She has been selling cosmetics for three years. She carries her work by following up with her established customers, visiting them house to house to offer them products. She also sells underwear for women, men and children. The business has gone very well for her. She has learned not to rely on the father of her daughter and to not let him be an impediment to her moving forward. Maria hopes to increase her earnings, for which she must buy underwear, socks, perfumes and cosmetics to sell to her clients.\r\n\r\nMaria has been with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for one year and feels very grateful. She has been able to improve her standard of living beecause of the loans. Now she would like to receive a loan to invest in cosmetics and merchandise. The school season is now approaching and is a good time for sales. She is thankful to the institution and project with Kiva because she has been able to make progress with her business.

live with him.  Sadly, his wife died from a respiratory illness a few years ago.  Now he only lives with a granddaughter.\r\n\r\nJoaquin has been growing corn ever since he was very little.  His parents did not send him to school, and they put him to work.  He also now has a cow, which he cares for in order to take advantage of the milk.  His granddaughter goes out into the community to sell the milk every afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan that he is requesting to invest in growing two hectares of corn.  This is not so easy during the summer season because corn is an irrigated crop.  For this he needs the loan to be able to get the harvest.  This will only be possible with the help of the loan. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to be able to cultivate four more hectares of land.  It will help him to improve his income because he is no longer able to do the business activities like when he was younger.  Therefore, in the next year he will need the help of some farmers to lend their services to help harvest the crop.  This way he will be able to have a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1279800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to invest in growing two hectares of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-03-26T23:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-25T23:30:09Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joaqu\u00edn Humberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833830}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T21:09:06Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:08:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":688793,"name":"Mandzaano Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of the Mandzaano Group are married women who on average are 45 years old and both live in same area in Teshie.\r\n\r\nThey work with the ID Ghana so they can carry out their activities.

El puesto  le queda a 10 minutos de distancia caminando, tiene tan solo una trabajadora que le ayuda.\n\nMarta ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo a CREDICAMPO,  pues necesita comprar una nueva plancha donde hacer las tortillas, debido a que la que tiene actualmente est\u00e1 muy deteriorada y aunque su esposo la ha intentado arreglar, siempre le da problema. Adem\u00e1s desea comprar un poco de le\u00f1a y ma\u00edz para su negocio.\nMarta sue\u00f1a con ver que sus hijos se superen y sean unos buenos ciudadanos.

She is happy in her relationship, and her partner works in auto body work and car painting, a business that he manages himself. They live in a house that they recently built on land that they inherited from her life partner's mother. They live there with their four children who are 17, 14, 11 and 6 years old.  All of them are in school, but the oldest one is about to finish and hopes to work so he can contribute to the household finances.\r\n\r\nMarta has a lot of experience as a tortilla maker. When she settled down with her partner at the age of 18, she decided to open a tortilla stand. You can say that it's a family trade because she learned it from her mother and is going from generation to generation. The stand is 10 minutes by foot from her house and she has only one worker who helps her. \r\n\r\nMarta has asked CREDICAMPO for a loan because she needs to buy a new griddle to make the tortillas because the one she has now is not in good condition. Although her husband has tried to fix it, it keeps on giving her problems. Additionally, she would like to buy some wood and corn for her business. Marta dreams of seeing her children improve themselves and become good citizens.

Two of her children are laborers in the agriculture fields while the other two go to school. In the picture, the lady standing with her hand raised is Yallavva. Due to the poor economic condition of her family, she didn\u2019t climb the stairs of school and had to leave her education behind. Along with all the clients of \u201cFuture Greens\u201d, Yallavva realizes that education is a vital key to a successful future for her children.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                    \r\nShe shares that her business is running quite well and, because of its success, she will be able to register her child in a good school this year! Her husband shares the same goals for the child. Yallavva has a sheep and goat rearing farm. Her husband also works in the agriculture fields and earns INR 150 per day.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                         \r\nThe requested loan will be used to buy lambs to raise. On behalf of her colleagues, Yallavva expresses gratitude and appreciation for the support from Kiva investors throughout the world who lend such necessary and vital support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1568352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair

After careful consideration though, he decided to learn how to buy and sell cellular phones from one of his friends.  After receiving a small working capital from a friend, he decided to start working in this particular field.  Nakouma now has more than 6 years of experience and knows his business quite well.  In order to boost his activity, and having heard about Soro Yiriwaso through one of its representatives, he decided to join this microfinance institution and to take a loan.  This is Nakouma's first experience with Soro Yiriwaso.  With this loan, he is planning to buy 15 cellular phones, 15 batteries and 10 chargers.  He buys his merchandise in Bamako and resells in his own shop in Bougouni, to both men and women.  Thanks to this loan, he is expecting to make a monthly profit of 45,000 CFA francs, which will help him to repay his loan, meet his needs and expand his

","en":"Soledad is a single mother of two children, one of whom is still in school. She lives with her mother and her young daughter. Soledad has worked since she was very young, thanks to her mother who taught her to get ahead and defend herself against the adversities of life. Soledad has worked for four years in the sale of cleaning products like detergents, insecticides, plastics, bleach, and more. Her main clients are her neighbors and friends, which she has been able to make through her good service during her time in this business. Soledad requests the loan to stock her business so she can then have more clientele.

With the passage of time, the small child grew and learned to take her first steps without her father's help, since he was always working and far from the city. \r\n\r\nHolding hands with her mother, grandmother and other family members, she established values and principles that, years later, made her into a good person who is collaborative with society. \r\n\r\nLaura's favorite sport has always been soccer, it has always been one of her passions and one of her weaknesses. She made many great friends who taught her many things, like how to fight and not feel alone, as with time her solitude brought sad memories of her father, with whom she didn't spend very much time. Her mother fell in love, and later founded new a home, and Laura's baby brother was born. When Esteban was born, Laura promised to take care of him and dedicate herself 100% to her new family, without de-prioritizing her studies or her passion for soccer.\r\n\r\nWhen Esteban was on the very of finishing grade school and Laura was finishing high school, together they had to care for little Brandon, the next in the line of siblings and mischief. Together, they taught him to play soccer and score many goals with a rubber ball, and soon another little sister was born into the family. \r\n\r\nLaura was soon alone and faced with a difficult decision: whether life has purpose or whether it solely exists to fulfill certain purposes, and soon she realized that she had a great ability to shine like the sun. \r\n\r\nThe professional career path she chose for herself, based not just on a name or a title but also on her principles, is business administration. However, her family didn't have the money to pay for such a long and expensive career, so Laura instead chose to work at a beauty\/hair salon as an assistant. \r\n\r\nThrough that job, she learned very important things, and from those learnings she decided to study aesthetics so that she could pay for the career of her dreams and help her siblings. \r\n\r\nThe Kiva partnership will be of great help to her, as she doesn't have the economic resources to pay her full tuition upfront since her work doesn't earn her enough to pay for all of her expenses. She is also saving up some money to be able to pay for the career she wants to study in the future.

She doesn't have enough money to meet all the demands of her customers, so she applied for the loan of 40,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more of goods such as flour, sugar, potatoes, cheese, and other goods.\r\n\r\nSaud looks forward to expanding her business by opening a small shop in her area and providing her family with a better future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1568620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase goods such as flour, sugar, potatoes, and cheese for the food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"hodeidah","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saud","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aesha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajhya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":160000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16144},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15984},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15984},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15984},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15984},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15984},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":15984},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15984},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15984},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15984}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.68,"local_amount":16144,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":16251.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479037918},{"amount":74.93,"local_amount":15984,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":16090.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490734491},{"amount":74.93,"local_amount":15984,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":16090.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504162186},{"amount":74.93,"local_amount":15984,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":16090.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517445970},{"amount":74.93,"local_amount":15984,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":16090.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529929898},{"amount":74.92,"local_amount":15984,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":16090.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542422248},{"amount":74.92,"local_amount":15984,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":16090.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561559874},{"amount":74.92,"local_amount":15984,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":16090.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579468902},{"amount":149.84,"local_amount":31968,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32180.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595075780}],"funded_date":"2014-03-30T16:56:25Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T10:58:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":689075,"name":"Edna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edna is 60 years old, married with two adult-aged children.

populated by indigenous Maya \u201cKaqchiquel\u201d. The men mainly work in the fields cultivating corn and the women create beautiful traditional textiles. Specifically, the textiles are made in the \u201cikat\u201dor \u201cjaspe\u201d manner when the yarn is resist dyed. Hanks of yarn are tightly tied and then dipped into dye. The tied portions resist the dye. Once the yarn is dried, weavers, like the ones in Vasconselos, make it into cloth with various designs incorporated into it. The cloth is then transformed into elaborate blouses and skirts that are representative of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cXejuy\u00fa\u201d is located in Vasconcelos. Five of the seven members of the Trust Bank work in producing textiles. They are requesting a new loan in order to introduce new designs, be more competitive and increase production. Matea is a 40 year old member of the Trust Bank. She is the hard-working mother of six children and tries her very best to meet their needs. Because she is recently separated from her husband, Matea has to work two jobs to support her children. She has requested a loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase additional thread, dye and paraffin in hopes of increasing her business. Matea sets a good example by her strong work ethic and perseverance. She looks happily looks forward to the next chapter of her life, realizing positive changes and being able to move forward.\r\n\r\nLike the other clients in Friendship Bridge, Matea has high hopes for her children. She realizes that education is a key to a successful future. Her biggest dream is that she will be able to watch her six year old son complete his education. Her other children were not able to go to school because they had to work to support their big family. Matea looks forward to the monthly educational trainings that the Friendship Bridge Loan Officer presents on topics like effective business administration and budgeting, nutrition and health, as well as women\u2019s rights and self esteem. Other relevant topics are covered as well and the information is of great use to Matea and the ladies. All realize that education is essential for them to improve conditions in their lives and move ahead!\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cXejuy\u00fa\u201d appreciates the kindness and generosity of Kiva investors. The women are committed to working hard to repay the loans. They are committed to achieving success in their businesses and empowering themselves. They will create a more prosperous and successful life for themselves, their families and their community of

They are talented artisans creating beautiful embroidered and woven textiles.\r\n\r\nCecilia is a 34-year-old member of the Trust Bank who attended elementary school for two years. Cecilia is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge for the first time as she needs working capital. She will invest the funds in the purchase of yarns, dyes and other materials that she will use to create typical skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d. A corte is the traditional Mayan women's tube skirt that can be anywhere from three to six yards in length, usually woven on a treadle loom. Along with an ornate blouse called a \u201chuipil\u201d, the \u201ccorte\u201d along with a belt called a \u201cfaja\u201d are universal elements of each women\u2019s traditional outfit or \u201ctraje\u201d. Each village in Guatemala has its own specific style, color, and design of \u201ctraje\u201d. Cecelia works with her husband and they generate enough income creating \u201ccortes\u201d to support their family. It is especially important to them that their children are enrolled in elementary school.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the \u201cSanta Cecilia\u201d Trust Bank share a common goal which is to increase their income by expanding their businesses and improve their quality of life. Besides having access to loans, they receive educational trainings during their monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. It is the combination of the loans and educational trainings that comprises the Friendship Bridge Microcredit Plus Program. During their meeting this past month, the training was about leadership and women\u2019s identity. The women learned how to identify the characteristics of a good leader and how each of them can develop their own leadership skills. \r\n\r\nExamples of other topics include health, medicinal plants and nutrition, effective business management, budgeting and indebtedness as well as self-esteem."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6100,"image":{"id":1569309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

This is Brian. He is the Deputy Head teacher at Firm Foundation School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of in Zana town, Wakiso Distrct with 260 students. Firm Foudation School, has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nFirm Foundation will repay this loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank. Brian ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":580,"image":{"id":1569793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nMa. Elena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\n\nShe is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\n\nMa. Elena dreams to expand her business and hopes to improve their quality of living.

is Marilyn, 55, a resident of Taguig, Philippines. She is a widow and she has children. She and her children manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarilyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams of having a grocery store and hopes to have a better life.

She studied up to the secondary school, but she couldn't complete her study.  In order to improve the condition of her family, Thikra started selling incense and perfumes in her area. She has had her business for many years. She earns a good profit but it is not enough to expand her business, and most of what she earns goes to her family expenses.

Mable has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving a quarter acre of maize and a quarter acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\r\n\r\nMable is married and has seven children.  She is fifty-seven years old and is known as friendly and trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and savings group.  Mable has been a farmer for thirty-four years.  Mable described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nMable first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Mable joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member.  Mable plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and repair the home.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Mable\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Mable and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4450,"image":{"id":1547760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"access cost-efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":4450,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mable","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabeti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philip ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":385128,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385128}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4450,"local_amount":385128,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":385814.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723091}],"funded_date":"2014-04-15T14:31:39Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Ingram","image":566975}},{"id":689195,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George thanks Kiva lenders for supporting his previous loan.

She and the other farmers represented in this group each receive \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer receives an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nChristine is 60 years old and has been a farmer for 40 years.  Christine provides for her 6 children.  The community and other farmers know Christine as friendly, hardworking, and experienced.

As an active member in her community, Christine also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and wants to help more farmers.  Christine plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school, save for the future, and buy a cow.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from harvest, training, and group support.  She was able to save money, and feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Christine and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund provides training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5500,"image":{"id":1547767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum hybrid seeds.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":5500,"lender_count":141,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hudson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret Nafula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Nasimiyu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulia Naliaka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Mulongo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samwel Wekesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justine Naliaka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":476061,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476061}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5500,"local_amount":476061,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":476849.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723089}],"funded_date":"2014-04-09T01:24:40Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":689158,"name":"Githagara Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary, Hellen and Selina are leaders of Githagara Women Group, which is based in Kiambu.

Here the majority of inhabitants make a living making ivory palm buttons and artisan goods, or running businesses.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here in Montecristi that 29-year-old Jessica lives. She is married and has three children - aged twelve, ten and seven years old respectively - who attend school. Jessica's husband is a businessman.\r\n\r\nJessica is a very plucky woman who likes to work and use her profits to help her husband with household costs. Jessica has a small restuarant in her home where she prepares \"ceviche\" (a marinated fish dish) in the mornings. Popular with her customers who come by every day, Jessica also sells fruit juices and fizzy drinks to serve with her meals. In the evenings, Jessica sells fried foods. She likes this work as she loves to cook and her profits allow her to give her children a decent life. Jessica has had the business for seven years and she hopes to improve it more every day.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy fish and other supplies for preparing meals. Jessica has been in the loan group for three years and likes it because she can take out loans.

She has livestock feed and a cattle barn. She built the cattle barn in a 3x5 dimension. Inoyat has all of the conditions for her planned business.

Petita lives in this area, and she's a 57 year old woman who's married but has been unable to have children. Her husband doesn't have a job and works occasionally. To get ahead Petita used the first bank loan to build a location at her home and set up a small grocery store. She sells all sorts of things in addition to sodas, water, ice cream, among other things. Since the store's location at her home makes the job feel less difficult, she works every day for almost the entire day. Thanks to this they support themselves and are able to put food on the table. She's going to use this loan to further stock her store, and purchase sodas, water, ice cream, and other essential products.

She is married and has two sons. Due to the lack of jobs, one of her sons left to work in the Russian Federation. Her other son works as a salesperson in a store. Anorkhol currently does not work. In the past, she practiced livestock breeding and after a break from it, she decided to restart this business. For this reason she requested a loan.
