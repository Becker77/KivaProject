Ella anhela dejar el legado del trabajo y la perseverancia a sus nietos, pues tambi\u00e9n tiene hijos que han terminado la carrera universitaria luego de los 40 a\u00f1os. \nElla pide este pr\u00e9stamo para poder invertirlo en la compra de aceites, jab\u00f3n en polvo, bebidas, enlatados y dem\u00e1s, y de esa forma poder seguir creciendo y dando a sus clientes todo lo que necesitan.\n","en":"Felipa has been running a store in her home since 2003. After she became a widow, her children helped her build some small bedrooms with their own bathrooms in the back of her land for her to rent. When she lost her husband, she became very depressed, but she was able to come out of her depression thanks to her children and grandchildren, who were always by her side.\r\n\r\nFelipa is very well loved in her neighborhood and has many customers that visit her store. She wants to leave her grandchildren a legacy of hard work and perseverance, since she also has children that have graduated from college after forty. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan in order to invest in buying oil, drinks, canned goods, powdered soap, and other items, so that she can continue to grow and give her customers everything they

Both she and her husband are farmers. They have been farming for fourteen years now and they are currently growing vegetables, maize and beans and they are also practicing dairy and fish farming. Eglay is excited about beekeeping as it will provide her with honey for medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is Eglay's first loan with Honey Care and she plans to use the proceeds from her beehives to pay school fees for her children and to repay her loan.

Klara has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Klara practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 22 years ago with 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Klara's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow and 2 calves on her farm, as well as a 1.40 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows peppers and beans for personal consumption and sale. Her monthly cumulative income is 11,000 som (KGS).

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.

Emmanuel works as a farmer to provide for his three children.  The community and other farmers know Emmanuel as friendly, hardworking, reliable and trustworthy.

He first joined One Acre Fund in 2013 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  As an active member in his community, Emmanuel also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Emmanuel plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school, save for the future, and buy a cow.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he was able to save money, and feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Emmanuel and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1547699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T19:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T19:20:10Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":176517,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176517}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2050,"local_amount":176517,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":177734.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723093}],"funded_date":"2014-04-16T20:19:05Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":686801,"name":"Nayely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nayely es una clienta de Kubo Financiero y esta es su historia.\nNayely tiene 23 a\u00f1os, es Licenciada en Psicolog\u00eda.

She is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 67 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Asneth has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAsneth is married and has 11 children.  She is 62 years old and is known as friendly.  She is active in her community in groups such as the prayer group, and burial committee.  Asneth has been a farmer for 38 years.  Asneth described her harvest as not bad with One Acre Fund last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAsneth is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Asneth joined One Acre Fund in order to get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers.  Asneth plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, and save for the future.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAsneth and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

She is pictured here in a group of 2 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 22 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Florence has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFlorence is married and has five children.  She is 47 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking, reliable experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, and savings group.  Florence has been a farmer for 20 years.  Florence described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\r\n\r\nFlorence first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Florence joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds,  earn enough to feed family, and send children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Florence plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, and repair the home, and save for the future, and buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Florence\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training, has more farm group support and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nFlorence and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

As the main source of income for her family, Bazarbubu practices livestock breeding. She started this business 9 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bazarbubu's hard work, she currently has 3 milk cows and 6 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Bazarbubu turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy sheep to increase the size of her herd. Bazarbubu plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 48 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Peter has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings (KES) for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nPeter is married and has six children.  He is 64 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking and experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group and burial committee.  Peter has been a farmer for 33 years.  Peter described his harvest as poor last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\r\n\r\nPeter first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Peter joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers by spreading the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Peter plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair his home, save for the future, and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Peter\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and was able to feed his family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nPeter and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":1547776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret Aliviza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jioce Atamba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis Akola","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":256752,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256752}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2975,"local_amount":256752,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":257932.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723101}],"funded_date":"2014-04-21T20:44:44Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":689280,"name":"Ariyen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ariyen lives north of Bogor, about two hours from Jakarta.

It's already been a year since she took up sewing ethnic Tajik-style women's dresses. She has acquired loyal customers and now wants to expand her business. Mavzuna is taking out a loan to buy a modernized, computerized sewing machine. With its help, she will be able to make dresses with beautiful embroidery in order to attract more customers. Currently, dresses with embroidery are very fashionable and such services are in demand. Therefore, Mavzuna will expand her business and increase the profitability of her business, as embroidery services cost more. <br \/><br \/>Mavzuna's family is large. She lives with her husband and three children under one roof with her mother-in-law, father-in-law and brothers-in-law. There are 8 people in her family. Mavzuna's husband is a taxi driver.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 58 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Nahashon has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNahashon is married and has four children. He is 52 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group. Nahashon has been a farmer for 22 years. Nahashon did not work with One Acre Fund last year, but believes he can have an even better harvest this year by working with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNahashon first enrolled with One Acre Fund this year and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Nahashon joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family, and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member. He wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Nahashon plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, to repair his home, to save for the future, and to buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nNahashon and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

She owns 60 cows, of which the majority are for milk. With this income, Monica has managed to look after her family by providing medication and by paying school fees for her two children and three sisters.<br \/><br \/>Monica is applying for a loan of UGX 3,000,000 to buy more dairy cows to increase her milk production.  She will also buy drugs for her sick cows.<br \/><br \/>Her major challenge is the dry season, which leads to inadequate grass to feed her animals, lack of water, and the resulting decrease in milk

Martin has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation. <br \/><br \/>Martin is married and has six children.  He is 49 years old and is known as an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups, such as the prayer group and burial committee.  Martin has been a farmer for 30 years.  Martin described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.   <br \/><br \/>Martin first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season.  Martin joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, to learn new farming methods, and to get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and wants to help more farmers.  Martin plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, to buy a cow, and to invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Martin\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits, training, and group support.  He was also able to save money and feed the family.   <br \/><br \/>Martin and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. <br \/><br \/>The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":1547756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esau","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":278148,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278148}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3225,"local_amount":278148,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":279607.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723109}],"funded_date":"2014-04-24T18:31:41Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Vacha","image":1668411}},{"id":689360,"name":"Enock","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enock comes from Nyakabungo, Sigirira in Ibanda district.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 62 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Moses has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMoses is married and has two children. He is 46 years old and is known as a friendly and experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Moses has been a farmer for 24 years. He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\r\n\r\nMoses first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. He joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and learn new farming methods to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  \r\n\r\nMoses plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and repair his home. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Moses \u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support. He was able to save money and feed his family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMoses and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1547772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moses ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacinta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aneriko","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anastanzia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":331638,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331638}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3850,"local_amount":331638,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":333794.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723103}],"funded_date":"2014-04-24T14:50:26Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Nicaise","image":1379391}},{"id":689344,"name":"Limpai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Limpai is 45 years old.

About two years ago she found herself living in the city of Bogota. Her family, which consists of her father Demetrio aged 48, her mother Maria Luisa aged 44 and her younger brothers and sisters Tatiana, Jose and Diana, all live in a town outside Bogota. \r\n\r\nViviana Andrea's parents don't have enough money to help her in her studies since they are farmers and are going through a difficult time. So Viviana Andrea is a young lady who finds herself all alone in the city of Bogota, paying rent and in a difficult financial situation. \r\n\r\nThis is why she wants to have help from Kiva, which would give her support to be able to continue with her studies. She is very responsible, intelligent, honest and helpful and has lots of other qualities which make her worthy of this help. She wants to continue her education even though she does not have any support from her family and bearing in mind that she is not having a very good time financially at the moment, as her salary is not enough to cover all her needs. \r\n\r\nAt present she has not been able to  sign up for the second term because of a lack of funds. As already mentioned, she wants to continue with her studies and when she finishes her health administration assistant studies she is going to take out a loan from ICETEX to finish the higher level studies, as she wants to be a senior hospital manager. She is totally captivated by this profession and has a lot of ambition. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, she wants to be the best as she has lots of ideas for improving the health service, taking into account the new health reforms, always thinking about the satisfaction of the service users."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1565004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a term's tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viviana Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":151047.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202293},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":151047.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286434},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":151047.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225141}],"funded_date":"2014-03-27T22:30:51Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":689372,"name":"Alphonsine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alphonsine is 46 years old.

loan. He is also grateful to Kiva for the good services UGAFODE renders the community. Being a disabled person, John is usually marginalized but it was a different case with UGAFODE. He was, therefore, able to fertilize his coffee plantation, which is having a positive effect on the growth of his coffee plants and beans. He anticipates a bumper harvest this season. He also deals in cattle fattening and milking as a secondary source of income. He owns 20 cows, the majority of which are for milk. Through the income he earned from the milk, John has managed to look after his large family by providing them with medication, paying school fees for his eight school-going children and constructing a permanent house for the family.\r\n\r\nJohn is applying for al loan of 2,000,000 UGX to buy more cows to increase his milk production and to buy drugs for his sick cows. His major challenges are the increase in school fees for his school-going children, the dry season, which leads to inadequate grass to feed his animals, and the lack of water due to the prolonged dry season, which leads to a decrease in the milk supply.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to see all his children attend school. John is honest and hard working.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1333197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479277506},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490974090},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T18:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504415134},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692716},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530922945},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542676334},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561809951},{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579786279},{"amount":48.77,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.23,"payment_id":595335942},{"amount":147.61,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":384450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.39,"payment_id":611969780}],"funded_date":"2014-04-03T15:18:50Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T13:58:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":690171,"name":"Nika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nika is a 44 year old married woman with 5 children.

She is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 53 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Margaret has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving seeds and fertilizer to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMargaret is married and has five children. She is 47 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and the prayer group.  Margaret has been a farmer for 29 years.  Margaret described her harvest as poor last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMargaret first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Margaret joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed her family.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member and wants to help more farmers by spreading the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training and has more farm group support.  \t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\nMargaret and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1547777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":283497,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283497}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3275,"local_amount":283497,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":283942.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723111}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T14:59:56Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":690175,"name":"Matauaina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matauaina is 19 year old married woman with 1 child.

He is pictured here in a group of three One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 38 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. James has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right, with his hand raised. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo. \r\n\r\nJames and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of KES 5,349 (shillings) for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJames is married and has 15 children. He is 60 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community, in groups such as the men's group and prayer group. James has been a farmer for 34 years. He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year, by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\r\n\r\nJames first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and he is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. James joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, and earn enough money to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member and he wants to help more farmers by spreading the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nJames plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. His own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money, and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJames and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nWith support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1547741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emphram Sisungo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet Nakhumicha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":203262,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203262}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2350,"local_amount":203262,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":203744.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723112}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T20:50:36Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":688653,"name":"Las Luchadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 se llama Las Luchadoras, donde las 17 integrantes de este grupo son mujeres luchadoras, que con gran esfuerzo trabajan por salir adelante.\nPetrona es parte de este grupo, ella es vendedora ambulante, y tiene a la venta todo tipo de productos, como ser ropas, calzados, camisas y dem\u00e1s.

In addition to this, Simon is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, prayer group, and burial committee.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nSimon joined One Acre Fund in 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Simon joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  Because he likes being a leader, and is an active community member and wants to help more farmers, Simon has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Simon's life because he has more farm training, more profits from harvest, more farm group support, and was able to feed his family.  In the future, Simon hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and buy a cow.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Simon and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5750,"image":{"id":1547710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase better harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-27T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-26T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":5750,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jotham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muhuyi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":497457,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":497457}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5750,"local_amount":497457,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":498524.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723117}],"funded_date":"2014-04-23T16:37:06Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mari Lansford","image":623046}},{"id":687003,"name":"Victor Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victor de 40 a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su familia en casa propia; el se dedica a la agricultura espec\u00edficamente al cultivo de ma\u00edz y maicillo, tiene muchos a\u00f1os de trabajar en este rubro y se ha hecho de experiencia muy valiosa que le permite obtener las mejores cosechas , el terreno de cultivo est\u00e1 ubicado en una zona de incidencia agr\u00edcola, el comercia en todas las zonas aleda\u00f1as y ya tiene mucha clientela fija, estas personas siempre prefieren su producto pues es de calidad y a precios realmente accesibles adem\u00e1s el servicio es inigualable, quiere aprovechar el auge de su negocio para aumentar la producci\u00f3n y as\u00ed poder tener mejores ganancias, necesita invertir en insumos pero necesita de capital por eso le solicita a INTEGRAL un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar semillas, abono, insecticida, fertilizantes, controles de plagas, herramienta, etc. el tiene buenas referencias de pago y est\u00e1 seguro que podr\u00e1 saldar su deuda a tiempo, y a la vez tiene la confianza que podr\u00e1 darle a su familia la vida que se merecen sin limitaci\u00f3n alguna.","en":"Victor is forty years old and lives with his family in his own home.

Rosemary has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nRosemary is 68 years old and has worked as a farmer for 47 years to provide for her six children.  The community and other farmers know Rosemary to be hardworking, reliable, and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community through the women's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Rosemary described her harvest last year as good, but hopes that she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Rosemary\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  She first joined One Acre Fund in 2013 and has continue working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  As an active member in her community, Rosemary also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about the One Acre Fund.  Rosemary plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school and repair her home.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from the harvest, more farm training and group support, and was able to save money and feed her family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Rosemary and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNehemiah is 80 years old and has been a farmer for 47 years to provide for his 7 children.  The community and other farmers know Nehemiah as hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and as an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community through the men's group, and savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Nehemiah described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNehemiah joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Nehemiah joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  Because he likes being a leader, and is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, Nehemiah has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Nehemiah's life because he has more profits from the harvest, more farm training and group support, and was able to save money and feed his family.  In the future, Nehemiah hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and invest in a business.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Nehemiah and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3525,"image":{"id":1547722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-28T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-27T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":3525,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nehemiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chrispus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":304893,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304893}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3525,"local_amount":304893,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":305617.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723121}],"funded_date":"2014-04-23T18:30:16Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meaghan Baron","image":1578122}},{"id":689424,"name":"Josphine's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group consists of seven groups of farmers in the Lugari District with Josphine selected as Kiva representative.

Jane has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJane is married and has six children.  She is 66 years old and is known as trustworthy and as an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group.

She first joined One Acre Fund in 2013 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and learn new farming methods.  As an active member in her community, Jane also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member and wants to spread the story about the One Acre Fund.  Jane plans on using future profits from the harvest to save for the future.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she was able to save money and feed her family.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Jane and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest, and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":1547739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-28T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-27T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":3725,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":320940,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320940}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3725,"local_amount":320940,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":322957.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723122}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T22:22:37Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meaghan Baron","image":1578122}},{"id":684316,"name":"Santa Elena Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santa Elena es un grupo muy unido, donde cada una de ellas  trabaja con la intenci\u00f3n de generar una ayuda a sus familias y tambi\u00e9n para ayudarse las unas a las otras.\nSe destaca el trabajo en equipo, entre ellas organizan actividades en donde se ayudan entre todas para el bien del grupo y ser beneficiadas cada una.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

Jane has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJane is a reliable member of the community. She is married with 7 children. Jane is 53 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 20 years to support her family.  In addition to this, Jane is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group and prayer group.  She described her harvest last year as good, and she hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and continue the success she is having with its farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJane joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Jane joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  Because she is an active community member and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Jane has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Jane's life because she has more farm training.  In the future, Jane hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school.  \t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Jane and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest, and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1547743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-28T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-27T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":5200,"lender_count":149,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":449316,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449316}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5200,"local_amount":449316,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":450839.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723123}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T20:45:57Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meaghan Baron","image":1578122}},{"id":690208,"name":"Lote","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lote is 40 years old with 5 children.

She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. She also sells different condiments. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. \nMyrna dreams to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Francisco will then be able to continue supporting his family and offering them more financial stability and well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1565521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock (ice lollies, ice creams and frosted cookies).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-03-28T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-27T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Fredy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142717},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146681},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150754},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":154941},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":159244},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163667},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":168212},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":172884},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":177685},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":182620},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":187691},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":192904}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":144.73,"local_amount":289458,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T10:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":291479.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245682},{"amount":75.49,"local_amount":150984,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":152038.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856414},{"amount":77.65,"local_amount":155304,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":156388.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504283092},{"amount":79.69,"local_amount":159384,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":160496.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983479},{"amount":622.44,"local_amount":1244870,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1253562.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531790142}],"funded_date":"2014-04-24T22:34:25Z","paid_date":"2014-09-25T09:31:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":689428,"name":"Everlyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everlyne is a member of a group in Lugari District.

In addition to this, Everlyne is very active in her community and is involved in the prayer group. She described her harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe 2013 Long Rains season will be Everlyne\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.

Everlyne plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Everlyne and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\n\n\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1547754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-28T02:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-27T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":53490,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53490}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":53490,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":54187.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723125}],"funded_date":"2014-03-29T13:41:16Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":687030,"name":"Francia Edith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francia, es casada, con 46 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene 3 hijos, uno de ellos a\u00fan es menor de edad, desde muy joven su madre la ense\u00f1\u00f3 en la venta de las loter\u00edas, desde hace 19 a\u00f1os desempe\u00f1a esta labor, aunque manifiesta que la actividad le gusta porque maneja su propio tiempo pero tiene tambi\u00e9n desventajas porque no genera prestaciones sociales, ni pensi\u00f3n.

He grows corn and beans and with his earnings from these harvests he is able to cover some of his household expenses.  He wants to buy the supplies he needs for his crops, such as manures, fertilizers, and seed, and to improve the land where he plants, which you can see in the photograph.  However, because he does not have the financial resources he needs for this investment, he has made the decision to request a loan, as this is the only way for him to continue with the growing process.  Like all people living in the country, he has placed his faith in farming, as he does not have another source of income and he wants to better himself by doing the best he can with his crops.  He hopes for an abundant harvest that will allow him to keep bringing home the daily bread and repay this loan.

She is pictured here in a group of three One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 30 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Alice has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving seeds and fertilizer to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAlice is married and has seven children.  She is 50 years old and is known as hardworking, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group, and prayer group.  Alice has been a farmer for 26 years.  She described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\r\n\r\nAlice first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Alice joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  She volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Alice plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school, repair the home and save for the future.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Alice\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from her harvest and was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nAlice and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included

is Thelma, 47, resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. She is a widow and she has children. She and her children manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nThelma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\n\nShe is requesting a Php20,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\n\nThelma hopes to have more customers and dreams to have a car.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\n\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1572301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The loan that he is requesting from Kiva lenders will be used to prepare the soil and buy fertilizers and seeds for planting. Andrea has one dairy cow that produces more than 15 kg milk per day; he uses some of it for the family and sells the rest. Andrea also plants wheat, corn, sage, and animal fodder in large quantities.

is requesting a loan to buy medicinal sage seedlings.

The wild sage smells very strong. Albania exports sage to the USA and, according to the statistics, 60% of domestic use of sage in the United States is imported from Albania.

She grows corn and beans. She has worked in agriculture for many years, and so she has much experience in this area. She is very well known in her zone, and she has good customers, since she obtains the best harvests and consequently sells products of the best quality at very affordable prices. Furthermore, her service is unequaled. Maria is characterized by her great friendliness. She is an entrepreneurial woman with a great will to advance. She thinks that taking advantage of opportunities will take her one step further toward success. In the last planting, she did not obtain the expected earnings, and this time she wants to increase production, but she needs the support of some capital, and for this reason she is applying to Integral for a loan that will allow her to buy seeds, fertilizers, compost, pest controls, herbicides, etc., and to improve the land, which is shown in the photograph, in order to continue with her plantings.

He is originally from the town of El Sauce, which is located 180 kilometers away from the Nicaraguan capital.  <br \/><br \/>Despite his age, this young man is very responsible in his work and with his family.   He is married and is the father of a young son who is in the third level of preschool.  <br \/><br \/>Noel works as a teacher at a primary school in a community that is located far from the city.  Therefore, he must travel by motorcycle in order to get work on time.

","en":"This is Johana Matilde. She is from Bogota. She is only 20 years old and lives with an aunt. She was raised by her grandmother and a neighbor. When she was 5 years old, she began to go to school at I.E.D. NUEVA COLOMBIA. She was a good student and despite the adversities that came up in her life she was able to finish her schooling successfully. She graduated from high school and for her that was a source of great pride, because she knew that she had reached her goal. Months later, she started scholarly activities again. She began to organize her goals and among them was starting a major. Not any major, but the one she had always dreamed of studying, which she had been planning out for two years, which is HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM.  \r\n \r\nTwo years went by and it wasn't possible for her. She didn't have any family support or financial resources to achieve it. She felt empty, disillusioned, and sad that she wasn't able to achieve her dream. But she didn't give up, because she always wanted to be someone in life. That was when she had the opportunity to study at CAMPO ALTO. A new dream to achieve was beginning. She started to work and that is how she helped herself go to school. She strived to be the best in the group in class and do the work. Sometimes, because of her job, she had to miss class, but if she didn't work she wouldn't be able to go to school. That was how she finished the 1rst and 2nd semesters, with hard work and eager to get ahead. In her family life, she has had to be alone, since her grandmother died. She was only 10 years old, but the neighbor always supported her, cared for her and backed her up, since he family never did. For her, that was a great value, she was more than a friend, she was a mother. \r\n\r\nNow Johana is in the 3rd semester of her major. She feels happy and eager to get ahead and be able to finish her major and be a master of herself. Now she is doing the practical training. She says that God always gives the heaviest battles to the best warriors, so she is doing her training outside of Bogot\u00e1, in Funza everyday from Monday through Friday. For her it is nice to know that she is achieving her purpose, but on the other hand, there are more expenses, like transportation every day, and paying for services that they charge her for in the home. Even though it isn't much, it is still money. She feels tense because she knows that somehow she has to go on, she doesn't have much longer to go and she knows she is going to finish soon. She always looks for the way, but now she is is going to KIVA for help and flexibility in the monthly payments so she can keep going to school and graduate with her degree. This help that KIVA can give her in this case will drive her. It will help her in her financial position. She will be grateful for the help for one more person to achieve a goal and make her dream come true.

It comprises eight members and is chaired by a board, with Sara as its president. The members are engaged in various trades: furniture sales, jam sales, sewing, bread sales, general store, grocery shop, stucco sales. The loan will thus benefit small women entrepreneurs. Sara has been with Pro Mujer for two years, on the introduction of a friend who also works with the field partner. She sells furniture, a business she started several years ago when she married, as her goal was to have a family business, so she took advantage of the fact that her husband was a carpenter. She will use the loan to increase their working capital by buying wood wholesale from the stalls of the town of El Alto. She will then sell the furniture her husband makes. The profits she derives from the business go toward supporting her family, since she is married and has four children. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she speaks of the health-related information she receives there and mentions that the members of the communal bank have become her friends."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":1563298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-03-28T12:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-27T12:30:01Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara Ceciclia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Fernando\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina Julia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melvy Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20076,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3027.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3207.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3295.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3384.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3476.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3684.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":467.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":480.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":493.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":536.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":441.1,"local_amount":3027.51,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3047.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144937},{"amount":467.28,"local_amount":3207.2,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3228.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838668},{"amount":480.09,"local_amount":3295.12,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3317.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264699},{"amount":999.66,"local_amount":6861.28,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6907.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546802},{"amount":536.87,"local_amount":3684.89,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3709.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530029966}],"funded_date":"2014-03-30T16:53:53Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T12:35:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":686800,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Crisanto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta octavo grado, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado y tiene una ni\u00f1a la cual es menor de edad y no estudia su esposa se dedica  a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos.  \u00c9l es alba\u00f1il y tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la pesca artesanal, aprendi\u00f3 el oficio de alba\u00f1il mientras trabajaba como ayudante y despu\u00e9s su mismo patr\u00f3n comenz\u00f3 a darle trabajo al ver su capacidad y desempe\u00f1o.

She has been running the business for 19 years. Because the capital that she had was very small, she could only produce only small quantities. Since Ribka is assisted by her daughter, they can produce 1,320 sieves each month, bringing an income of approximately IDR 400,000 each month. This business enables her to support Stevanus in meeting their family's needs. In addition, she also helps Stevanus to grow vegetables in a small plot of rented land.\r\n \r\nNow Ribka needs more money to buy the raw materials to produce more sieves. Therefore, she requested an individual loan from TLM amounting to IDR 3,000,000. The loan will be spent on fabrics, wire, threads, and straws. She believes the loan from TLM will help her in improving her

","en":"Petrona is 32 years old and completed up to ninth grade. She is married; her husband is a builder. The couple has four children who still live at home; the youngest three are still in school. Nobody else lives with the family.\r\n\r\nPetrona has been making a living selling clothes and seafood for twelve years. She learned this trade with her mother. It was she who introduced Petrona to the business world, for which she is very grateful. Thanks to her mother, Petrona is able to help her husband with household costs. Petrona tells us that she travels to the city to buy the fish. She takes a pick-up truck from the highway and then takes three buses. The return journey takes the whole day. Petrona goes such a distance as the fish is cheaper. Petrona sells door-to-door in the neighbouring villages. She does not have a fixed timetable. Sometimes she works eight hours in the day, sometimes more. She likes her job, though, as her dream is to help her family to prosper.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy seafood and clothes. Petrona's dream is that her children can go to university as she herself did not have such an opportunity. Petrona also wants to buy another plot of land so that her children can live there. The land that she currently owns is not big enough to build another house. Petrona would also like to start a clothes business, and to pay off her loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1565110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy seafood and clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-03-28T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-27T13:30:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petrona Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":21.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":23.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":26.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":28.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":30.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.11,"local_amount":22.11,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":22.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216472},{"amount":23.02,"local_amount":23.02,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":23.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817844},{"amount":254.87,"local_amount":254.87,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":254.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243213}],"funded_date":"2014-03-30T22:27:18Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:16:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":689682,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 61 years old and married with eight children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas, with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\r\n\r\nKeffa is married and has five children.

She has two children who are not in school because they are very little.\r\n\r\nHaydee earns her living in commerce; she has a small shop that she started a year ago. Previously, she worked selling tamales, \"atol\" [a corn-based drink], and plantain chips that she made at home, but after she had her children, it became impossible to go out selling because she had to care for them. That's when she started her business with $50. She bought sugar, oil, and soap and she discovered that they were selling. Each time, she bought more and more. She gets up very early because the customers arrive to buy bread and coffee starting at 5:00 a.m. She is very grateful to God for her shop, which is getting better every day.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting will be invested as follows: one part for the shop, and another part to pour a cement floor in her house, as it has a dirt floor and the children play there. \r\n\r\nHaydee has many goals for the future. Among them are to have a well-stocked shop and to build her house with bricks, since it is currently wattle and daub. With the profits from her shop, she hopes to repay the loan and to leave the door open for future loans.

They are looking forward to working with Namaste. Namaste will provide them with basic financial training, a business advisor to help them develop and follow a business plan, and a small loan.\nMaria Eugenia (third from right), 39, the leader of the group.  She has a husband and four children.  The youngest is not old enough for school; two children attend school and the oldest daughter helps in the business.\nMaria Eugenia\u2019s business is selling handmade blouses, scarves and accessories to the many local and international visitors who come to La Antigua. Her oldest daughter is now in charge of her mother\u2019s old sales location in front of one of the well-known churches.  Maria Eugenia looks elsewhere in the town for clients.  She has been reasonably successful in her business and has been able to diversify her inventory to include sales of tortillas, snacks, basic home and personal care items, and traditional clothing.\nHer dream is to add the sales of jade necklaces to her inventory during the high tourist season. That way she can take advantage of the larger number of potential clients to increase her earnings.  She also hopes to find a permanent location to use in the future, so she will no longer have to sell on the street as she does now.\nShe currently has monthly sales of 5500 Guatemalan Quetzales and net profit of 1250 Guatemalan Quetzales. She hopes to increase this substantially during her nine month cycle with Namaste.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1570222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to add the sales of jade necklaces to her inventory during the high tourist season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Antonio Aguas Calientes, Antigua, Sacatep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2014-03-28T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-27T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deysi Xiomara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Telma Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Macedonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":377.78,"local_amount":2888.98,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2921.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479141197},{"amount":188.89,"local_amount":1444.34,"processed_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-27T08:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490835115},{"amount":376.73,"local_amount":2880.86,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543535},{"amount":188.9,"local_amount":1444.51,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026840},{"amount":189,"local_amount":1445.26,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1461.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542519109},{"amount":217.95,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561652787},{"amount":158.12,"local_amount":1209.15,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1222.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581607288},{"amount":2.63,"local_amount":20.23,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649572953}],"funded_date":"2014-04-19T16:52:23Z","paid_date":"2015-06-21T12:15:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":689767,"name":"Vicha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicha is standing aside his mother in the photo.

Rehema is 20 years old and lives in the town of Mityana in the Mubende region of Uganda. She is married and has 2 children. For the past 2 years, Rehema has been working hard to manage her food stall, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rehema has requested a loan of 600,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food such as raw matoke (cooking bananas) to sell, and will help Rehema to generate greater profits and stock more fresh foods to sell. Rehema hopes that in the future she will be able to educate her children. \r\n\r\nRehema is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills
