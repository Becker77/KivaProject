Oliver hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nOliver is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1571098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable

She lives with her family in the Shahrituz District. In Tajikistan, including in Shahrituz, the majority of residents practice farming - about 60 to 70% of the population. Because Tajikistan is a mountainous country and businesses and companies are only located  in the valleys, about 7% of the population works for the government.<br \/><br \/>Oyruzi didn't take up farming like her countrymen, but chose a different trade. She received the skill of wood carving from her father and mother. Oyruzi engraves trunk walls. You can see her work in the photograph. Oyruzi is only 19 years old but she knows her profession very well. Now she needs to buy wood in order to continue her work, but she does not have enough money to buy the necessary amount of wood, which is why she is requesting a loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1572502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy

tea so that they can later sell it to the factories. Nason also sells bananas as a way of getting additional income, just in case the tea business does not perform well. He earns some money from the sale of bananas to sustain his family. He hopes to use the loan money amounting to two million shillings, to buy fertilizers to boost the fertility of the soils, so that he can harvest much more. His main challenge is the dry season, since it causes his tea to dry. This affects the sales and the incomes negatively, but he believes that if he applies the fertilizers the soil, fertility will be boosted, and he will harvest much more and be in position to build a permanent home, which has always been his dream in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1571738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

","en":"This story begins 29 years ago when a little girl named Carmen Mercedes was born. Her family consisted of a mother, a father, four sisters, a brother, and herself, and she had a happy childhood and adolescence. When she was just 16 years old, she met the boy who would become her husband, and in the beginning, everything was beautiful. But as time went on, he got to know many women, and more than once he deceived Carmen and hurt her. From this 13-year relationship, they had three lovely children: two boys and a girl, who are the engine behind everything that drives Carmen. All that she wants is to get her children ahead. After 13 years together and 6 years of marriage, Carmen learned her husband had been unfaithful to her with the woman who was to be the godmother of their youngest child.\r\n\r\nThis was in 2011. When she kicked him out, she was left alone with three children, without work or income, now that he was gone. Her parents were watching out for her and the children, though, and her oldest sister learned about a new class in the neighborhood, which Carmen took as a way out of her isolation since it was nearby and she was able to save on bus fare. The class was about sewing, and she learned to run a flat sewing machine. It was her way out of all the pain, anguish, and helplessness that her husband and the father of her children had left behind him. In her class, she made a lot of friends who helped her to forget her reality. One special woman in particular helped her get a job in a hospital as a custodian. From there she was able to get a new job as a security guard.\r\n\r\nLife changed and she was able to meet her household obligations. She continued to save so that she could one day buy her own home, as she had been saving throughout her marriage (unknown to him). But her chief goal has always been to see her children become professionals, and to make that happen, she began looking for other options for schooling. She found out about CampoAlto through some students who worked at the hospital where she did. One of the professors gave her some information and she decided to enroll and reach out for one of the dreams she had never been able to achieve while she was keeping house for her husband. She made a sound decision: the decision to begin to live. Lost time can never be recovered, but she started school to show that there are no impossible things nor incapable people.\r\n\r\nFor now, she is achieving one of her dreams, that of studying for what she has always wanted to become, a nurse's aid. In October 2013 she enrolled, and her greatest desire is to graduate and serve the most needed people in the health field, doing so with professionalism. She will learn and show the entire world, including her ex-husband, that a person's dreams and what it takes to achieve them are worth the effort. She also hopes that her children will realize that nothing is impossible, regardless of circumstances.\r\n\r\nShe needs Kiva's collective help, since her expenses are considerable, not just for tuition but also those that her three children generate. It's a little complicated for her to pay all of her bills, but with the loan from Kiva, she can save part of her money and use it towards her or her childrens' expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1566305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay a semester of tuition toward becoming a nurse's aid","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-29T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-28T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T11:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":149490,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":467882890},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":149490,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202299},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":149490,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286440},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":149489.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225147}],"funded_date":"2014-03-29T01:26:38Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":687425,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta de 22 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia junto a sus padres y su grupo familiar, desde hace 4 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de pescado lo hace de forma ambulante por las diferentes colonias que se encuentran cerca de su lugar de residencia, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas ayuda en su casa con los gastos, la clienta est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de pescado por mayor para poder seguir con su trabajo ya que esa es su \u00fanica fuente de ingresos y as\u00ed seguir ayudando a su familia para que puedan tener junto con ella una mejor calidad de vida.

It is composed of women who know one another through ties of kinship and community. The women average 25 years of age. Married with an average of one child, they run different businesses, such as the buying and selling of grains, as does DJENEBOU, who is the first persons standing from the left in the photo. The women live in large traditional families in Sub-pr\u00e9fecture de SELINGUE, R\u00e9gion de Sikasso (Republic of Mali). The women have been in small-scale commerce for several years and are much in demand in their businesses buying and selling condiments: black pepper, tomatoes, and onions.\r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying the growing needs of their customers, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program ten years ago. They are now on their eleventh solidarity loan. \r\n\r\nDJENEBOU, who is the group's president and well-known in CARRIERE, excels in selling condiments. She intends to use her loan to purchase 5 sacks of onions. She gets her supplies locally from wholesalers and sells her goods retail to a mixed customer base paying with cash or credit in SELINGUE. She is hoping for a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will enable her to pay back the loan and to reinvest in her business buying and selling condiments.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1571748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

From his first moment, his first breath, his first cry, it was clear that his destiny and greatest dream would be: cars. \r\n\r\nAs the days passed, his father bought him toy cars and played with him, and when the boy played with the cars he thought it was going to be this way when he was grown. Except, instead of playing with cars, he would repair them. He would interact with them as if he were one of the greatest of the famous mechanics of the country and the world. Each time he watched television with his parents, and would see the mechanics repairing cars, he knew was going to be the next. He would fulfill his dreams thanks to the great efforts of his parents to help him fulfill his goals. \r\n\r\nHe would fulfill his goals with the help of his parents and with the help of God. In time, the young man finished high school, and yearned to go out and enter into an institution which would help him achieve his dreams. He wants to study in the institution he has seen.  \r\n\r\nHe could only fulfill these dreams if he were able to get help. He would be very pleased if there wasn't the small problem of his budget, which wasn't enough. He was offered a few forms of aid, one of which was a Kiva loan. He was very interested in the loan and immediately began following instructions. Because of his great aspirations to study, he would comply with all the instructions he is given.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to be the best in the school and to stay current with the payment of the money which will be lent to him. He has great motivation to study, to be in the institute taking advantage of his eagerness to fix cars and to help all the people who need the knowledge and training he will gain through CampoAlto."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1566386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of school.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-03-29T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-28T06:40:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlon Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":390000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":132880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202301},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":132880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286442},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":132879.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225149}],"funded_date":"2014-03-29T11:35:33Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":690317,"name":"Vanthorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Originally from a village of Kampong Cham province\u2019s Prey Chhor district, Vanthorn is aged 27 years and married with one kid.

En el mismo lugar existe un grupo de personas que conforman el Grupo Mier, cuatro son los integrantes que conforman dicha asociaci\u00f3n en VisionFund, ellos se dedican a la cr\u00eda y engorda de animalitos para su venta.\nJuan es el representante del grupo, a \u00e9l le encanta participar en las actividades de su comunidad y sobre todo ser l\u00edder es as\u00ed como adquiri\u00f3 el puesto de delegado municipal de su comunidad; gracias a ello se enter\u00f3 de distintos programas que ofrec\u00eda el municipio para que sus habitantes se vieran beneficiados con todo lo que en ese momento se propon\u00eda y es como obtuvo la oportunidad de iniciar con un negocio de cr\u00eda y engorda de borreguitos pero s\u00f3lo lo apoyaron con un porcentaje muy peque\u00f1o y tuvo que aportar lo que faltaba. Despu\u00e9s de ello busc\u00f3 a personas que le compraran sus borreguitos ahora \u00e9l ya tiene a sus clientes a los que solo les hace sus entregas.\nAhora don Juan cuenta con un corral en donde puede atender a sus borregos y muy emocionado cuenta que en unos d\u00edas llegar\u00e1 a su corral un nuevo borreguito qu\u00e9 cuidar y alimentar como se debe, as\u00ed su peque\u00f1o lugar podr\u00e1 convertirse en uno m\u00e1s amplio y  sobre todo con m\u00e1s borreguitos que alimentar.

Nevertheless, the influence of various factors have caused the inhabitants to stop speaking it little by little. In the same region there is a group of people who make up Grupo Mier, four of the members who are part of said organization in VisionFund, work raising and fattening young animals for sale.\r\n\r\nJuan is the group representative, and he loves participating in community events and above all being a leader. This is how he got the position of municipal representative of his community; thanks to this he found out about various programs offered in the municipality for the inhabitants to benefit from everything that is currently available. This is how he got the opportunity to start a business raising and fattening lambs, but they only help with with a very small percentage and he had to come up with the remainder. After that, he looked for people who would buy his lambs and now he has customers who only do his deliveries.\r\n\r\nNow Juan has a corral where he can look after his lambs and he is very excited, saying that in a few days he will get a new lamb for his corral which he will raise and feed as one should, so his small place can become a bigger one, and above all with more lambs to feed. The most important is the help of his wife Antonia and his two children Jacqueline, 19 years old and Jos\u00e9 Dolores, 18, who in their free time help their father care for the animals.\r\n\r\nJuan lives near a soccer ground and every weekend they organize tournaments and it has occurred to him that in the future, he would love to have a sports store so that the team members can buy their uniforms and everything they need in his store, but he will only achieve this working as he has done up until now, of course, with the support of all his family.\r\n\r\nVisionFund has changed the lives of the members of Grupo Mier, as thanks to the opportunity of getting loans, their businesses keep on growing, but this wouldn't have been possible without the will and the determination that they have had to get ahead.\r\n\r\nGabriela is part of the group, she says that she started raising lambs thanks to Juan's example. Alicia has been raising piglets for barely 4 months which will be able to generate income for her household when she is able to sell them and, finally, Elvia who also works fattening pigs. All of them do it in the hope that it will offer a better quality of life for their families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":1565147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two lambs, food and fodder.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-03-29T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-28T09:00:02Z","loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":277.08,"local_amount":3666.67,"processed_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-04-16T17:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3672.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":468072891},{"amount":554.18,"local_amount":7333.34,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7344.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479290205},{"amount":554.18,"local_amount":7333.3,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7344.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490986609},{"amount":554.16,"local_amount":7333.34,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7344.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504427540},{"amount":831.24,"local_amount":11000.01,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":11017.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517705225},{"amount":554.16,"local_amount":7333.34,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7344.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530255665}],"funded_date":"2014-03-31T02:28:05Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T17:43:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joelle Kuiper","image":1765797}},{"id":690068,"name":"Horonya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"HORONYA est un groupe de l\u2019association BENKADI.

He also has a bee-keeping project in Kashenshero in Mitooma District and this gives him additional money which he use to cater for the needs of his family. His clients are mainly coffee traders in the same area from which he operates and these have supported him greatly since they assure him of a market for his coffee. He has applied for a loan of 3,000,000 UGX to be able to buy mulch for the coffee plantation so that the harvests can be better than the usual quantities harvested which would result into higher incomes. He is mainly challenged by the weather which hits his coffee plantation hard but he believes that with the loan, if given, he will have the soil fertility boosted and will be in a position to earn much more and hence be in position to educate all his children (the last three) which has always been his wish, and the reason why he works hard despite the old age bracket he is in

Ana has four employees and, in the high season, she hires two other temporary workers. With this work, Ana earns enough to cover basic household costs and to watch out for her husband, who has health problems following a traffic accident.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy an overlock sewing machine, with which Ana will be able to optimise her working time and improve the quality of production. This will make customers loyal and she will receive more contracts, thus increasing her income.\r\n\r\nAna dreams of making her workshop dynamic and versatile, allowing her to maintain strong levels of production throughout the year and guaranteeing stable finances. This will allow her to offer her husband and children a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1566446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an overlock sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-03-29T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-28T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.28,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Ana Luc\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":107038},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":110011},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":113066},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":116206},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":119433},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":122750},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":126159},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":129663},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":133264},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":136965},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":140769},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":144676}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":113.74,"local_amount":220137,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T10:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":226701.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245692},{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":110908,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":114215.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504283101},{"amount":122.01,"local_amount":236144,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":243185.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983487},{"amount":65.4,"local_amount":126574,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":130348.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531790148},{"amount":68.84,"local_amount":133240,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":137213.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542541656},{"amount":67.16,"local_amount":129995,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":133871.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561674631},{"amount":120.26,"local_amount":257557,"processed_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":265237.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.81,"payment_id":595188438},{"amount":133.01,"local_amount":285445,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":293956.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.47,"payment_id":611813480}],"funded_date":"2014-04-01T10:39:19Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T12:18:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":690378,"name":"Long's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Long is a 59-year-old mother of nine children.

She opens her business 7 days a week and 10 hours a day. \r\n\r\nAminata would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. She requires a loan in order to buy ladies' and men's clothing for her business. She hopes that this loan will help her to increase the size of the business. In the future, Aminata plans to buy bikes for commercial purposes, which will generate more profit and increase the size of the business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1572636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy more ladies' and men's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Freetown Central","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2014-03-29T14:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-28T14:50:09Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":849897.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479052644},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":849897.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490748748},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":849897.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504177445},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":849897.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462081},{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":1666666.68,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-10T09:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1699794.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542439417}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T14:04:43Z","paid_date":"2015-03-10T09:52:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":687505,"name":"Flor De Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor de Mar\u00eda tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa e hijos en el distrito de Oyot\u00fan, una comunidad que se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y gnade\u00eda, ubicada en la Provincia de Chiclayo que pertenece a la Regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nElla se dedica a la venta de salchipapas y aguadito desde hace seis a\u00f1os, su negocio se encuentra ubicado en la parte posterior a su domicilio, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 1 000 nuevos soles para la compra de mesas y sillas para arreglar su local y de esta manera atender a mayor cantidad de clientes generando mayores ingresos para su familia.\n\n","en":"Flor de Mar\u00eda is 41, she lives with her partner and children in the Oyot\u00fan disrtrict, a community that works in agriculture, trade and animal husbandry.

","en":"Kenia comes from Puerto Cabezas.  She is 28 years old and married.  She has two girls, ages 4 years and 6 months, respectively.  \r\n\r\nFor the past five years she has lived in an unstable way with her family.  She still remembers that every six months she would have to look for a new house with a price that she could manage with her salary in order to rent it, paying a monthly rent of 120 U.S. dollars, including utilities.  Nevertheless, it was her dream to have her own home and live securely.  She has struggled to build her house out of concrete.  \r\n\r\nTwo years ago, together with her husband she bought a plot of land using savings and a pay bonus.  With the first loan that Pana Pana granted her, she was able to buy materials for her home: concrete blocks, cement, iron, fine and coarse sand, wood, corrugated roofing, and nails.  \r\n\r\nNow she is asking for a second loan to begin the structure of her house with concrete.  It will have a size of 47 feet by 57 feet, with two rooms and a septic tank for the bathroom.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is: to have a house that provides her family with comforts, to install the roof, to compact the ground in order to install a floor, to install windows, doors, and railings, and to establish her own source of income through a business, with the goal of safeguarding the well-being of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1566473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to build her home out of concrete, with two rooms and a septic tank for the bathroom.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Puerto Cabezas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":328,"posted_date":"2014-03-29T14:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-28T14:50:10Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenia Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.02,"local_amount":2125.12,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T19:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2180.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479252904},{"amount":38.97,"local_amount":962.77,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":987.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504387710},{"amount":300.01,"local_amount":7412.11,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7603.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519666217}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T17:17:14Z","paid_date":"2014-08-23T09:33:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":690429,"name":"Rashad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rashad is a 28-year-old refugee.

separated from her husband for several years. \r\n\r\nOver the course of her working life she has been employed by different companies in the city, but 18 years ago she decided to become independent, and she began making embroidered textiles to sell among her relatives and friends.  Additionally, she supplements her income with the sale of catalog products, working alone every day from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m., and thus she has managed to generate the resources to pay for the family\u2019s expenses. \r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan that she is seeking in the purchase of wholesale merchandise (perfumes, cosmetics, accessories, and clothing), which will allow her to have a greater variety of products available to offer her customers, thus improving the earnings that she obtains from her labor.\r\n\r\nFrancisca reveals that her greatest desire is to open a very big and well-organized dressmaking business that would generate employment opportunities and improve the living conditions and well-being of her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1566461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Her mother only introduced her to business. \r\n\r\nWhen she got married, her husband gave her some amount of money to start a business. Working seven days a week and fifteen hours a day, she earns about 1,800,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nSento would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL.

Judith has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 89 other individual farmers belonging to this group. They will each receive the necessary materials to plant \u00bc-acre of maize and \u00bc-acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings apiece.\r\n\r\nJudith is a reliable member of the community. She is married with five children. Judith is 37 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last ten years to support her family. In addition to this, Judith is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group and prayer group. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\r\n\r\nJudith is now enrolling for the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Judith joined One Acre Fund so that she could learn new farming methods. Because she wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Judith has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. In the future, Judith hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school and buy a cow.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Judith and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover the initial cost of purchasing the package of seeds and fertilizer from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives. \r\n\r\nPlease note that there are 4 additional group leaders in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.

Hudson has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. \r\n\r\nFarming inputs will be delivered to him and the 90 other individual farmers represented and the leaders that represent them in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant one-quarter acre of maize and one-quarter acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings each. \r\n\r\nHudson is a reliable member of the community. He is married with eight children. Hudson is 61 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 38 years to support his family. In addition to this, Hudson is very active in his community and is involved in the prayer group. He described his harvest last year as good. He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t \r\n\r\nHudson joined One Acre Fund in 2013 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and earn enough to feed his family. As an active member in his community, Hudson also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nHudson plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school and save for the future. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more farm group support and was able to feed the family. Hudson is also involved in the community's school committee. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Hudson and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t \r\n\r\nPlease note that there is one additional group leader in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.

selected Safania as their Kiva representative. We see him on the right with his hand raised. We will deliver farming supplies to him and the 96 other individual farmers represented in this group. They will receive credit needed to plant one quarter acre of maize and one quarter acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings.\t \r\n\r\nSafania is 74 years old and has been a farmer for 50 of those years. He works hard to provide for his 10 children. His neighbors know him as friendly, hardworking, and trustworthy. Apart from farming, he is also involved in his community in a men's group, a savings group, and a prayer group. He described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of the One Acre Fund and the other farmers in the group. He joined the fund in 2010 to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and acquire fertilizer, hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family. Because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nSafania has gotten more involved with the One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. His work has improved his life because he has more profits from his harvest, more training, and more support. He also was able to save money and feed his family. In the future, he hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, buy a cow, and invest in a business. \r\n\r\nThe One Acre Fund focuses on working with small farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Safania and the Tumaini Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of buying the seeds and fertilizer package from our fund, which continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from the fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives. Please note that there are four additional group leaders in this photo who will be working with the One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva loan. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the

Mayan-Tzutujiles who live in the highlands of Guatemala. They are motivated to sustain and expand their small businesses with the ultimate goal of creating better lives for themselves, their families and their community. The Trust Bank is on its first loan cycle and ladies are quite excited!\r\n\r\nThe seven women participate in monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer who assist them with their loans. In addition, they participate in non-formal educational trainings that are given at each meeting to learn useful and relevant information that can be applied immediately to their business practices and their families. Examples of these themes include effective business management, budgeting and accounting as well as nutrition, health and medicinal plants. Other topics include women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, self-esteem and leadership.\r\n\r\nBecause of the leadership skills that she has demonstrated, Dora is the 28-year-old President of the Trust Bank. She is married with three children. For many years, she has worked with her husband at their shoe store and offers their customers shoes for all ages and styles. They have an excellent location for their business which they rent in the center of the town. The couple is anxious to please their customers and because Easter Week is fast approaching, they anticipate increased business. Easter is a major holiday in Guatemala and it is often the time of the year when the population purchases new clothing and shoes. Dora wants to access increased capital so that she can meet the increased demands of her customers and so she is applying for a loan.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Trust Bank have recently learned about the kindness and generosity of KIVA investors in funding their small loans. The ladies share that with the investment in their businesses and the profits that they will hopefully realize, that their primary goals are to be able to give their children food, clothing and shelter. Their next very important goal is to be sure that their children are able to go to school because they realize that a good education is the key to a more successful and prosperous future.

She also sells a hot corn beverage called \u201catole\u201d. In spite of the fact that she is older, Manuela works hard and with her years of experience, she is able to make enough money to take care of her older husband, herself and her youngest son who is still in high school. She wants to see him graduate with a solid career and be able to access a good job. Manuela also wants her son to assist her with the administration of her business.\r\n\r\nManuela wants to secure a loan from Friendship Bridge to invest in her food business in order to increase the number of customers. She will use the funds to buy utensils and basic food items including grains because she wants to be sure that she has plenty of supplies when she is ready to make her delicious appetizers each weekend. \r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank \u201cAjkay\u201d have various businesses that include textile production, animal husbandry and stores where items for daily consumption are sold. During the monthly meetings, they meet with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer who assists them with their loan cycle that lasts for ten months. The women also receive non-formal education trainings on subjects like women\u2019s rights, leadership and self-esteem, as well as business management, indebtedness and accounting. Other themes include health, nutrition and medicinal plants.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank are very grateful to have access to small loans and education because they realize that these are real tools that they can use to empower themselves, their families and their community.
