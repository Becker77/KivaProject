She is pictured here in a group of eight One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 72 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Lilian  has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nLilian is married and has six children. She is 35 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable and trustworthy. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Lilian has been a farmer for 16 years. Lilian described her harvest as not with One Acre Fund last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nLilian first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Lilian joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds and to earn enough to feed family and send her children to school. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, is an active community member, wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nLilian plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, save for the future and buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Lilian\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, was able to save money, has more farm group support and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nLilian and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4450,"image":{"id":1495398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-03-29T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-28T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":4450,"lender_count":132,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Scholastica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Casphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":385128,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385128}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4450,"local_amount":385128,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":385147.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579723132}],"funded_date":"2014-04-01T18:19:49Z","paid_date":"2014-12-31T10:37:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":687691,"name":"Keng Sonny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Keng vive en el la ciudad de Tingo Maria, ubicada en la selva peruana, es un joven con muchas ganas de salir adelante, es por ello que se esfuerza mucho en su negocio de venta de cerveza, con el cual ya lleva trabajando casi 2 a\u00f1os, con lo cual puede tener ingresos para poder salir adelante, asimismo, se da tiempo para apoyar a su abuelo, algunos d\u00edas de la semana.\n\nKeng est\u00e1 agradecido con los prestamistas kiva ya que gracias a la ayuda que le han brindado el podr\u00e1 realizar mejoras en su local y6 tambi\u00e9n podr\u00e1 comprar mercader\u00eda para su negocio y as\u00ed mejorar sus ingresos y seguir\u00e1 luchando para poder hacer realidad su gran sue\u00f1o:\u201d estudiar una carrera universitaria\u201d.\n","en":"Keng lives in the city of Tingo Maria, which is located in the Peruvian forest.

He is a trader of utensils and she, apart from her household jobs, raises cows and sheep. The family has some land, but hardly anything grows on it. The couple works around 16-hours a day to make a living. \r\n\r\nTheir village of Sankarpur is quite near to Bhojpur, the town of blacksmiths. The products from this Jharkhand rural belt are quite famous in the neighboring towns of Bihar, West Bengal. Sherun\u2019s husband sells the finished products from Bhojpur in the far away towns and villages of neighboring states. But due to the shortage of cash, he has to make short trips and spend more money on travel.  A better cash flow to buy more goods in bulk will improve his profits as he will be able to cut the costs of transportation.\r\n\r\nSherun is 37 and the mother of two. Throughout the first part of her life, she remained confined to domestic chores. Even after her marriage, nothing much changed initially. And her role to improve the financial landscape in her husband\u2019s family remained minimal.

She personally inspects every home that she places students in and refuses to place anyone in a home that she personally would not sleep in.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is really a 24-7 job,\u201d said Carolina.  \u201cThe international students I work with sometimes call me at midnight asking for my help.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge that Carolina faces is the seasonal nature of her business.  Cash flow is slow during low seasons, though the workload does not decrease.  She will use her $10,000 Kiva loan to stabilize her cash flow, as well as hire two part-time employees to assist her in operations.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Carolina hopes to expand her business to service other college towns such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Berkeley, helping more international students discover a warm welcome to the United States.\r\n\r\nCheck out Carolina\u2019s

Aref decided not to wait for years to get a job either in the public or private sector. Instead, he worked very hard in order to begin his own business. At first, he collected used metal materials and resold them to the metal factory for eight years. Year by year, he improved his business and opened a small construction supplies store. Over time, the store has become bigger and bigger. Now, he is earning a good profit, but it is really not enough to purchase more construction supplies. Most of what he earns goes to the rent for the store and the rest goes to the expenses of his family. Therefore, Aref applied for a loan of 500,000 YER from AMB in order to expand his store.\r\n\r\nAref looks forward to increasing his capital and becoming a wholesale dealer.

Despite the young age of her children, Gulnora does not sit idly and helps her husband as much as she can. She works from home sewing ethnic Tajik dresses. In the village where Gulnora lives, there are no dressmaking shops so women primarily perform this trade. As there are no offices or industries in her village, it is difficult to find employment to make a living from, so she offers her services to the population.<br \/><br \/>Gulnora wants to take out a loan to buy additional sewing equipment. She has already worked with \"Arvand\" and is thankful that the products this organization offers are accessible and provide assistance in resolving problems. She has a good credit history. She really hopes that the received loan will help her accomplish her plans.

He runs a retail business and both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for twelve years now and are currently growing maize, beans, bananas, and vegetables. Mark and his wife also rear livestock. \r\n\r\nMark lives in Kitale, which is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. Originally dominated by English settlers in the early 20th century, the region\u2019s farmland was redistributed after independence. This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\r\n\r\nMark is requesting a loan to buy beehives and apiary materials to start beekeeping. He is excited about this as it will earn him some income and provide him with honey for medicine and beeswax. This will be Mark's first loan with Honey Care and he plans to use the proceeds from his loan to expand his beekeeping project. His hope for the future is to successfully earn more income from his farm to sustain his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7.02,"image":{"id":1571169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping.

That's why he is now an employee. He travels close to six kilometers to arrive at his workplace.

Her partner is Michael and they have child. She and her partner manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nAnselma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\n\nShe is requesting a Php10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\n\nAnselma hopes to expand her business and dreams to have a better living.
