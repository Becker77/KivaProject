Its people are friendly and polite, like the members who work every day to improve their households' financial situations in order to give a better future to their families. They do fieldwork, such as agriculture or raising animals, and work in business. Many work in the city in different jobs. <br \/><br \/>One of the members of this group is Tania. She is taking out her second loan alongside her friends and partners from the loan group Cochapamba. She enjoys her loan group because her friends give her advice and guide her in her life. <br \/><br \/>Tania is 22 years old. She is a single mother of a 3-year-old daughter. She lives in her parents' house and shares the household expenses.<br \/><br \/>Tania spends her time at home caring for her daughter, but when she goes out, she does farm work like raising chickens, pigs, and guinea pigs, which she sells in the city. She also works in agriculture. <br \/><br \/>She is going to invest the money from her loan in the purchase of chickens, guinea pigs, animal feed, and seeds. Her goal is to have her own stall in the market to sell her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":1568240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chickens, guinea pigs, animal feed and seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-03-31T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-30T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":4925,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Aidee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xavier Heriberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4917.51,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":614.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":614.69},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":614.69},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":614.69},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":614.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":614.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":614.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":614.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1231.26,"local_amount":1229.38,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1231.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479138917},{"amount":1846.89,"local_amount":1844.07,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1846.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832828},{"amount":1231.24,"local_amount":1229.38,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1231.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258875},{"amount":615.61,"local_amount":614.68,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":615.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541129}],"funded_date":"2014-03-31T16:45:48Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T11:34:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Hedel","image":971490}},{"id":691236,"name":"Halima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima is a very hardworking and enterprising woman who says that she has been able to greatly increase her income and help her family, thanks to her hard work.\n\nHalima thanks Kiva lenders for supporting her financially in her tailoring business.\n\nShe is asking for a loan to buy materials,thread for her business.

She is 52 years old and is married. From this marriage she has 5 grown children, but the youngest of them still lives with her. Her husband works in a fish factory in Manta. <br \/><br \/>Nelly is a persevering woman who likes to work and use her efforts to help her husband to get ahead. She works raising poultry. She has a small chicken farm; at times she buys from 100 to 200 chickens, which she raises over two to three months. This is the amount of time that it takes for them to be ready to sell. When they are ready, she plucks them and delivers them to some local stores. She also sells them by the pound from her house. <br \/><br \/>She works from three to four hours per day feeding and caring for her animals, and thanks to this, she is able to earn something to benefit her household without leaving her home. She is going to use this new loan to buy chickens, feed, and medicine so that they have better growth. She has been with the loan group from the beginning, and she enjoys it because of the help that it offers her.

is turing into a very promising business man.  With his last Kiva loan, Alexis successfully secured a large automotive client, allowing him to open a shop. His plan was to hire two graduates from a local automotive vocational school as apprentices, which he still plans to do once they graduate in June.  The loan from Kiva was Alexis' only hope to get his business in a position to grow, and with the loan he has been able to do so with very early success.  Thank you.\n\nGiven the professionalism and expediency that Alexis was able to deliver supplies to his automotive client, Alexis has been approached by an automotive vocational training school to provide construction materials as they expand their school.  This school is a project of Rwanda's Workforce Development Authority and funded by the World Bank.  As a main supplier, this would give Alexis a prime opportunity to be recognized by much larger and more influential companies.  The success of this would really set him on a path for massive expansion.\n\nAlexis has been given a temporary order to supply the first round of construction supplies for the school.  Once he has proven that he has the capacity to complete such large orders, they will grant him the full 12-month contract.\n\nAlexis needs a short-term loan of $25,000 so that he can meet his first order on time.  We know he can do it.  Alexis continually impresses us with his professionalism and strategic planning.  And, AEC has been with him along the way so that he can reach his dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":25000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":25000,"image":{"id":1574036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":["Growing Businesses"],"use":"To supply construction materials for a vocational training program.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":319,"posted_date":"2014-03-31T09:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-30T09:50:03Z","loan_amount":25000,"lender_count":821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":25000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12500,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T08:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":12500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517731311},{"amount":12500,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-30T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530486197}],"funded_date":"2014-04-16T22:14:29Z","paid_date":"2014-09-30T09:12:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":691281,"name":"Peace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peace is a 45-year-old lady with 7 children, four of whom attend school.

She plans to use her loan to buy fish, groceries and cosmetics to sell to her customers. She procures her goods locally and in Accra from wholesalers and makes her retail sales in Teshie for cash.

This challenge has been for many reasons, among which is being displaced, but she is a very humanitarian person.  She finished her undergraduate studies in 2003. One goal that she has always had is to study to be a nurse. Despite the economic difficulties of her current situation, she is pursuing her goal of becoming a nurse.  Her motivation is her two children.  She has clear goals and one of them is to finish nursing school, and then to specialize in this field in order to bring assistance to her community and a better future to her children and herself.  Without studies she will not be able to aspire to a better future for everyone.    \r\n\r\nShe is thankful to the people who have offered help at different points in time.  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, her current economic situation is not the most stable, since she does not have the money sufficient to pay for the monthly tuition fee.

Souadou, who is standing at the right in the photo, is 48 years old, married, and the mother of five children, including two girls. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions selling kitchen utensils. She goes on travel [or abroad in the case of her acquaintances] to obtain her merchandise. She spends 300,000 [francs] for the utensils. After the merchandise arrives, she sells them on credit.

In time, she met the man who is now her husband.  He works in agriculture and building too, when there is a chance of work. They have two daughters: Doris, who is 7 and in the second year at the local elementary school, and Karol, who is 17 months old. Belsy and her husband have been growing coffee for two years and so they will have their first coffee harvest this year. They also grow corn in the middle of the coffee plantation so they have grain to feed themselves and do not have to buy it. Belsy is currently learning to carry out all the tasks required for growing her crops, because up to now she has given up most of her time to look after her younger daughter. She is gradually getting more involved in the project because it has been her husband who has done most of the work and who has taught her. Previously, the plot of land they had in the locality was too big and so they sold it and instead bought something closer, a 20-minute walk away, which is a little under a 1.75 acres.  They decided to work in agriculture because the area is perfect for growing coffee and it is also the main source of employment and income there. She and her husband share the goal of looking after their current coffee crops and buying more to ensure that they can provide a better standard of living for their family and, in particular, provide for their children's education.  Belsy would like to see her children study at university and get good jobs which will give them other sources of income. Also, if it were possible, she dreams of one day being able to buy a vehicle for getting around. For this reason, she is seeking financial help which she will use to buy fertiliser and to pay workers to clean up the land and look after it well. It is newly planted this year and is now beginning to bloom and she wants to strengthen it so that her first harvest will be an excellent one."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1568873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy supplies and pay workers to take care of her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-03-31T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-04-30T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belsy Anacely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":519.29,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10093.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.71,"payment_id":624827081}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T15:49:13Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:00:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":688895,"name":"Indriana Alexis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Indriana es una de las integrantes de Banco Mujer Mujeres Vencedoras, tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es estudiante y se mantiene con su local de fotocopiado, recargas telef\u00f3nicas y venta de art\u00edculos de librer\u00eda, este local se encuentra ubicado muy cerca de la frontera entre Costa Rica y Panam\u00e1, es una de las pocas fotocopiadoras de la zona, por lo que muchos ni\u00f1os de las escuelas cercanas comprar los art\u00edculos ah\u00ed mismo.

She has been running a business of selling dry food for twelve years now.  She works from 06am to 06pm daily and is able to make a small monthly profit.\n\nThis is her first loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania.

His parents had low income and so could only provide education for him until 4th grade. They had to work to provide for the family and because Pedro was the eldest son, he had to help his parents.

India had its own rich heritage of cotton varieties, which for their short staple were a favorite of European hand-looms. Many Indian cotton types are also considered to be high absorbents and preferred in surgical processes. But later the government made farmers adopt the hybrid seeds for higher production. This process got a further boost during India's green revolution in the 1970s.   \r\n\r\nAs the world started to look for more choices for different clothing types and more environmental concerns were raised, a need in markets was felt for cotton that was not hybrid.   \r\n\r\nFollowing the trend of a growing demand for this kind of cotton, some local NGOs in India decided to persuade some farmers to adopt again the traditional varieties.  Initially there were few takers, but Nagappa was one of them. \r\n\r\nNagappa has dedicated himself to organic cultivation of desi (traditional) fiber crops for a long period. His family has been in cotton farming for generations.  He alone has revived 24 desi cotton varieties, some of which are currently cultivated in more than 200 acres of land in Makiri village, a rural pocket some 20 kms away from Bydag, Haveri district.

She has a fifth grade education, because her parents' financial situation made it difficult to go to school. She is married, and her husband works in agriculture, growing staple grains (corn and beans). They have ten children, of whom six are already married and four still live with them at home.\r\n\r\nGloria is a housewife, taking care of the household duties and her children. Ever since she was little, she has done this work; it was passed down to her from her mother, who taught her how to fill this role from the time she was small. She expresses that it is very important work and that she feels proud to carry it out. She has always received the support of her children in the work that she does.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan requested from CrediCampo to set up her own chicken farm. Specifically, she will purchase 200 young chickens and feed for them. She already has a fair amount of experience in the area of chicken farming, so she knowns that it is an activity that generates good income for her and her family. At the moment, she doesn't have any chickens for sale, but with the help of the loan, she will buy more young broiler chickens.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that in the future she will have plenty of wellbeing for herself and her family and to be able to have a better house and a better quality of life together with her husband. For her children and grandchildren, she dreams of them becoming respectable people in society and that they stay in school and attain a university degree. All this, she says, she will achieve with the help of God and thanks to the loan she has requested and future loans that she will request to improve her quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1568959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to set up her own chicken farm.

He was only able to study high school. He would have liked to study a career, but because of his parents' lack of financial resources he was not able to continue studying. His domestic partner works in household chores. Juan started farming with his father since he was very young. The distance that he travels from his home to his place of work is 2 kilometers, and he goes there with his life companion. He will use the loan to buy two small steers for breeding and fattening.

Zubaida has a secondary education. Character-wise, she has leadership qualities, always solving all of the family problem by herself, responsible, communicable, and happy.  Zubaida and her husband are involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zubaida's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 31 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk.  She also works on a .54 hectares of land, where she primarily grows corn. She sells the resulting harvest to wholesale distributors.  In order to further develop her business, Zubaida requested a loan from the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" to buy cows to increase livestock headcount. The purchased cows will stay on their farm.  In the summer, the livestock will be under a shepherd's care.  Zubaida plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a greenhouse on their

her husband, is raising four children. Nazira has a secondary education. Nazira and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 10 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nazira's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 2 horses, and 10 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 14,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk. She also cultivates a 1.86 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows beans and perennial grasses. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Nazira turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy sheep to increase the size of her herd. Nazira plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to build a new

with her husband, is raising two children. Tolgonay has a secondary education. Tolgonay and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 7 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Tolgonay's hard work, she currently has 15 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). She also cultivates a 1.0 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows corn and watermelon. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Tolgonay turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy sheep to increase the size of her herd. Tolgonay plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

As an additional income for her family, Liliya works with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding, after having started 22 years ago with 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Liliya's persistent work, she currently has a dairy cow, a horse and 20 sheep. She also has 1.20 hectares of land, on which she every year grows beans for farm use and sale. The monthly combined income is 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Liliya turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan to purchase fertilizers for processing the land.

Her is a teacher by profession and works to this day as a teacher in a school. For the last 10 years, Murod has simultaneously run his own small business, specifically manufacturing flour for his fellow villagers. His neighbors and fellow villagers are saved the effort of going on the road to bring wheat for milling. This is why Murod's services are always sought after. Now he wants to expand his manufacturing business and buy a new machine for milling flour. He does not have the 2000 USD needed for this goal, as it is an expensive machine.

Khamasha has a secondary education. Khamasha and her husband practice livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 4 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Khamasha's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 1 heifer on her farm. Her monthly income is 17,000 som (KGS). She also cultivates a 0.32 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows corn and potatoes. The gathered harvest is sold to wholesale distributors. For the purpose of further developing her business, Khamasha turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Khamasha plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to make home

Exalashasman is a hardworking, responsible man with a strong desire for personal growth.  He used to own a small grocery store but because of recovery problems he decided to change jobs and now he buys and sells scrap metal.  He buys it in neighborhoods and districts near his community and in other areas.  He also provides transportation services.  Exalashasman has been gradually overcoming various challenges he has been faced with and he is always looking for ways to get ahead.  Now he is requesting another loan for working capital to buy scrap metal so he can provide his customers with better service.  He spent his capital repairing his truck.  Exalashasman is very grateful for the support Kiva lenders offer people with limited economic resources.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1569241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled

This is a place known for its traditional culture and also for being minutes away from two of the best beaches in the province: San Jacinto and San Clemente.\r\n\r\nThis is where Francisca, 40, lives.  She is married and has 2 children aged 10 and 5 years who attend school.  Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nFrancisca is a woman who enjoys working so that she can help her husband and get ahead.  She is taking this loan for herself and for her husband.  While Francisca sells clothing through a catalog, her husband works cultivating corn and rice.  He farms all seasons of the year, as his land lends itself to being able to irrigate crops during all seasons.  This is because these are lowlands that are close to the river that crosses the city.

They are on average 47 years old with four children. They all live in the Darsalam neighborhood in Segou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nThey met through neighbors, family, marriage bonds and profit-generating activities in their neighborhood of Darsalam. They retail clothing, raise cattle, and sell prepared foods. To increase their working capital, the group\u2019s members have decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso; this is their fifth cycle of solidarity loans.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yaya Mariam (first woman sitting from the left to the right in the picture) is a major retailer of clothing and incense for Darsalam and neighboring areas. She plans on using her loan to purchase two pieces of brocade to satisfy demand from her clientele. She retails for cash or, often, extends credit to her mixed-gender clientele.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. Yaya  Mariam hopes to make an average monthly profit of 45,000 XOF. It will be reallocated to pay for part of the family\u2019s expenses and to increase her working capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1574040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy brocade.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-04-01T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-01T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaya      Mariam           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":245.84,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":117289.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479264072},{"amount":245.84,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":117289.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960954},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":117289.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677303},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":117289.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676946},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":117289.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209484},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":117289.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658498}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T02:37:27Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T17:15:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":691767,"name":"Filomena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filomena is a 49-year-old woman with four children.

Ang\u00e9lica is 35 years old. She has a partner and a son. For ten years she has earned her living in agriculture, growing mainly coffee. She learned about farming from her partner and his parents who have been farmers all their lives. Ang\u00e9lica completed primary school as far as grade five. She is grateful to her parents for their support.\r\n\r\nCoffee is a delicate product and if you don't treat it correctly at the right time, you risk losing your whole crop.

They also called themselves Morning Star Group. The village where they live is 35 km from the main capital town of Manipur. Jenlu, who is raising her hand, is the featured borrower profile member. Her husband's main occupation is cultivation and he cultivates in accordance with seasonal changes.\r\n\r\nJenlu's house is located in one of the main lanes in the village. The grocery shop is located facing the lane and farmers in the morning usually drops in at the shop to purchase local cigarettes (biri), betel nut and betel leaves to take with them to the field. She also sells essential and everyday household goods like cereals, rice, edible oils, detergent soap, detergent powder, dish wash, shampoo etc. While her husband is engaged in the field, she stays at home and manages the shop at the same time does her household chores. She cleans the house, cooks meals for the family and sends the kids to school. The village has very few shops and jenlu is determined to run the business successfully.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva loan, she will purchase more supplies for the grocery shop like three bags of rice, one tin can of edible oil, and other essential goods. She has plans to expand the shop and make a living. Cultivation will be difficult for both the husband and wife as they age and therefore, she is keen to make the shop as successful as it can be. She is happy and motivated to work with Kiva and wishes to continue working with the organization. She says, \u201cthank-you so much Kiva\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in piggery, weaving, farming and grocery shop

She and her mother have owned the family bakery business for 19 years.  Her bakery, which is located in the county of Barranca with in the Province of Puntarenas, offers freshly made bread and confections and is well known as one of the best bakeries in the area.  Having established this successful business, Emma has been able to improve the lives of her brothers by helping them get a formal education and improve the overall income of her family.\n\nThis business has been built from the ground up with Emma\u2019s and her family\u2019s own money, but due to the rising costs in both materials and processing, they have found that it has become necessary to diversify their business.  Emma and her family wish to accomplish this diversification by offering their baked goods in other areas of Puntarenas, and to this end, they have rented a space in a nearby locaity for just this purpose.  They have already begun to move some the of necessary equipment to the new location, but need extra capital in order to purchase ingredients for the bakery as well as new and different merchandise, which will then allow them to open this new branch of their already popular business.\n\nEmma and her mother currently have a daily income of roughly 50,000 CRC.  By adding the sale of new non-bakery related items to their inventory they will be able increase their current income as well as improve their quality of life.  In terms of organization, part of the staff will move to the new location while the others remain at the original.  With the current bakery, Emma and her family have demonstrated their ability to make the monthly loan payments, and have repaid the full amount of their previous loan.  Having visited the area where they intend to open the new baker, I can assure you that it has an excellent chance for success due to it\u2019s prime location on the main street, which is a better location than their already successful current business.  There are no other bakeries in the area.\n\nWith their 19 years of experience, Emma and her family intend to make this new venture even more successful than their current one, which should be a rather easy task given the level of competency that they\u2019ve developed over the years.  They will also continue to strive to go above and beyond the needs of the clients who patronize their current shop.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1568024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded

She lives in Bishnupur, 25 km away from the city of Imphal, Manipur, which is in the northeastern region of India. She lives with her husband and son. Her husband works as a carpenter. From time to time, he goes to the neighborhood to construct houses for wages and goes to the jungle to cut wood for his carpentry work. Her only son, Galeo, is still studying at the primary level. Since her husband\u2019s income is unreliable and insufficient, Nungsaikim opened a small petty shop near her house. The main item that generates income in her shop is paan. Apart from paan, she keeps chips, cigarettes, roasted peas and some other edibles. With the Kiva loan, she wishes to expand and fill the shop with more items. Since there is no other alternative means to generate income, she wanted to give maximum effort to raise more income from this shop. Like other mothers, she has a dream of providing a decent career for her son. The rest of the group members are engaged in chive, banana, cabbage and ginger cultivation.

They sell clothing, sandals, and perfume among other things, and they are all very familiar with their market, their suppliers, and their clients, which allows them to make the most of their investments.  With the loan that they are currently asking for they would like to increase their sales catalogue for the summer season in the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThis group became interested in working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer through the recommendation of the groups formed by Fray Casiano, and they received the information lecture.  During the month of May, the were given the training lecture, which demonstrated that they are a dependable and organized group who have a strong desire to work and to support one another in growing not only financially, but personally as well.  Forming their board of directors in a democratic manner, they then filled out their credit application to begin their work in keeping with the requirements of Banco Mujer.\r\n\r\nThe president of this group is a young woman of 20 named Argerie.  She is married, her husband helps support her business, and has a 3-year-old child. She works with the hope of providing her son with a better future.  \r\n\r\nThey all live in Barranca, Puntarenas, an area that has few options for employment.  Argerie will be able to invest in her home-based business selling clothing, sandals, and costume jewelry that she purchases from larger business in the Central Valley and look for new ways to generate income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1568013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

Five years have passed since then and recently she had her first interview and was selected as a cabin crew member for the airlines industry. Her dreams have been fulfilled but she couldn\u2019t tell her parents that she needed to make a refundable deposit in order to join the airlines industry. Her parent\u2019s financial insecurity has been known and shared by her since she was a kid. Her friend (http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lend\/683130) who is also a Kiva member, informed her about the education loan and she approached WSDS for financial assistance. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will pay for the refundable deposit and start her cabin crew training. This is a wonderful thing that happened to her says Lalawmpuii and she wishes to continue building a relationship with WSDS and Kiva. She says she will be able to support her father in financial matters and will lessen their burden. For this, she is grateful towards WSDS and Kiva. She says, \u201cthank-you so much Kiva\u201d. She wholeheartedly thanks and appreciates Kiva for being such a great help and a savior who provided her a platform to pursue her dream career.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1566584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"To pay for a refundable deposit for cabin crew training","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:03Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lalawmpuii ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-06T01:08:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":686585,"name":"Maa Gojabayani Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raibari is 44 years old, married and has two children who are studying in school.

She is a mother of two daughters. Her husband is an IT Technician by profession; he has been doing a job in a private sector IT Company for many years. He is a guardian of the family and responsible for managing the household.\r\n\r\nAliya wants to start her own business, a coaching center. For this purpose, she needs to buy some furniture and renovate her place of business. But due to financial constraints, she is unable to incur these expenses to fulfil the needs of her coaching center business. Therefore, Aliya has applied for a Kiva loan from the field partner BRAC Pakistan. \r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan amount, she'll be able herself to incur the expenses related to her business operations so that she can start her business as soon as possible. Aliya is very happy and thankful to Kiva and BRAC
