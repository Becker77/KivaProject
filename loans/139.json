This is 30-year-old Josephina N. from Mbeya. She is married and has three children between the ages of 1 and 13. She is also responsible for supporting one dependent whose parents cannot care for her. \n\nJosephina has been running a genge business since 1999. \"Genge\" is the Swahili word a type of outside shop or stall. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof where the proprietor sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place where local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\n\nJosephina works at her business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by two employees. Josephina currently earns about $51 USD each month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $800 USD to purchase more sugar, kerosene, soap and cooking oil in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of goods in order to get more profit from her business . Josephina thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":288038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more sugar, kerosene, soap and cooking oil in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T03:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine B.

She went to work for a company and became a long-time employee.  Unfortunately, she lost her job when her employer went bankrupt.  Around the same time, she acquired a piece of property in Santa Ana Los Olivos so that she could start over.  While moving into her new home, Victoria worried about how she was going to earn a living.  During a visit to a street market near her new home, she thought of starting a business selling condiments (chili peppers, spices, ground seasonings, etc.).\r\n<p>\r\nHer business started off badly.  She gradually gained a few customers, but being an informal street merchant is a risky proposition.  Having to acquire and guard her merchandise created double work for Victoria.  The municipal police would often come by and throw out her merchandise instead of asking her to remove it.  This created headaches for her because she had to deciD. between making a large purchase of inventory or make the sacrifice to save enough money to acquire her own spice stand.  Fortunately, Victory is happy to have her own business in an area that is well-kept and secure.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.    Uila needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nUila joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Uila's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nFalefia, a loan manager at SPBD, asked Uila a couple of questions about her business.  Here are her answers:\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score of Uila V. provided by SPBD:*               1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 39 years-old and married with two school-aged children. Teresita owns and operates a  specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as sugar, snack foods, canned goods, candies, shampoo,  soap and toothpaste in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Teresita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her life was always increasing work, achievements and disappointments, that converted her into an optimistic and successful person. For twenty years, she has sold food in a market stall in the city, where with the help of her mother she also sells manufactured products made from plastic. Both activities permit her to educate her children and bring them a better life, although never beyond the necessities. The thing she likes best about her work is being attentive to her clients so that they return, which she considers a strategy that never fails.

In order to complete her plans, with the money that she is asking for now, she will buy a variety of plastic products in order to increase her sales and continue saving for her future shop. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":491469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increasing merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":178.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993260},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":178.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718043},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":178.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751718},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":116.64,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":124.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672960},{"amount":143.38,"local_amount":382.36,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":408.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154625}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T18:00:33Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lois Parshley","image":null}},{"id":181945,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is a single lady who lives and operates her business in Machakos.

Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Jovelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Having completed secondary education and with 8 dependents, she entered the food retail business in 2001 with initial capital of 50,000 FRS. Her daily revenue is now 10,000 FRS. She aims to use this loan to boost her business by purchasing boxes of milk, jars of jam (exeter, bull beef and rio), pasta, sugar, biscuits, fruit juice and other staple foods. \r\nShe saves money every day in order to help grow her business and so that she will have a good display of goods for potential customers, despite a rise in prices. Her goal is to have a large shop, and if possible eventually several others in the town, so that she can be a wholesaler in future. Her dream is to improve her children's living conditions so that they can continue their studies, and also to buy a plot of land.

It has five female members who all know each other and are neighbors.  The members are as follows: Guadalupe \u00c1vila M., who will use her loan to buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her 'nopal' (prickly pear) crop; Leticia L. C., who will buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her prickly pear crop and improve her production; Marquelia R. D\u00edaz, who will buy men's and women's perfume, cosmetics and cosmetic kits in order to stock her business; Herminia R. M., who will buy fruit such as custard apples, loquats and avocados, to stock her business, and Guadalupe R. \u00c1vila, who will buy prickly pear stalks and fertilizer in bulk, in order to start her own production.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe \u00c1vila M. is the group's representative.  She is 56 years old and studied up to the fifth year of elementary school.  She is married and has five children: 1 daughter and 4 sons.  Her sons are agricultural workers.  Guadalupe's husband sells firewood.  He goes out to the countryside and gathers firewood to sell.  Guadalupe herself has a plot of land where she grows prickly pears.  She has requested this loan to buy manure for her prickly pear crop so that she can produce more.  She started this business 5 years ago.  Previously, she used to grow corn and beans.  She provided her children with some land and they also grow prickly pear cacti.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe learned her business as a young child.  Her father always used to grow prickly pear cacti and she and her siblings worked with him, weeding, removing the stalks and chopping.  They would cover the chopped prickly pear with soil so that it served as fertilizer and they would remove the fleshy pads.  These days, they hire a rototiller that chops the plants and removes weeds but it is expensive to hire.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe bought the plot of land where she grows her prickly pear crop and her dad left her the house where she is currently living.  Her plot of land is in the countryside.  She either walks there or takes a taxi which leaves her on the edge of the road and she then walks to her plot of land.  Her business is important and special to her because in good seasons, if they pay her well for her produce, she enjoys working on her crop.  She feels proud when she receives good money for it.  Guadalupe's customers are those who arrive first in their trucks to buy her produce.  Those who arrive first and pay the most take the produce.  She cuts her prickly pear to sell every week or two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe challenge that Guadalupe faces in her business is that during periods of cold weather, the cacti do not grow.  Her business is very well known because people eat prickly pear every day with their meals and it also has healing effects.  Guadalupe faces competition from other people who produce prickly pear but everyone is free to sell their product wherever they most like.  Guadalupe re-invests some of the profits that she makes back into her business, investing in buying fertilizer for her next sowing season and she also buys food.  Her children help her in the business.  Her daughter and husband cut the cacti and her husband also carries the boxes of produce.\r\n\r\nTlalnepantla is a very pretty village.  The countryside is very green and covered with prickly pear cacti.  You can also see the nearby volcano.  The climate is cold and temperate.  Guadalupe's business has helped her family financially.  When they don't have any money they go and cut some prickly pear to sell and then have enough to cover their food expenses or anything else they might need at home.  Guadalupe would like to repair her home, laying floor tiles and painting it so that it looks nicer.  Her plans and dreams are to enjoy a better life and to have money so that she can do more things.  She would like to have another bedroom for her daughter's children as her daughter is a single mother and has two children.  The improvements that Guadalupe would like to make for her children's future is to ensure that they have somewhere to live and for them to be content.  She is very happy to be receiving this loan because it will help her a lot with her harvest.  It will help her to produce more and she hopes to pay it back properly so that she can access more loans in the future.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"We thank you for the loan that you are giving us because it will help us a lot.  It will help our businesses and families to grow\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":699848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for her prickly pear crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLANEPANTLA MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-26T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marquelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":385,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4645.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850132},{"amount":577.5,"local_amount":6900,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6968.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292406},{"amount":385,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4645.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160664},{"amount":385,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4645.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233541},{"amount":192.5,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2322.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512393}],"funded_date":"2011-01-26T20:06:59Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:11:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":272174,"name":"Stephen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stephen is a 47-year-old married man, with six children living in an owned house in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Her past loans have been used for many things for the house and for the education of her eldest daughter who just graduated with a degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management.\r\n\r\nShe applied for this loan to finish paying off the old tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) from her previous loan and to make a partial payment on a brand new motorcycle. She hopes that in the future she will be able to save enough money to expand her business and build a better house.

She is 48 years old, single with a 15-year-old son who studies in the school of Santa Ana (T\u00e9cnico Daniel Ermida). She lives in her parents' house as she was the oldest daughter of five who stayed with them till their death. She keeps animals such as milking cows, pigs, chickens, guinea pigs, and hens which she sells whenever there is an opportunity.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is an informal vendor at the markets of the town of Cuenca. She sells vegetables, fruits and whatever can be sold from Monday through Saturday from approximately 7 am to 5 pm, depending on sales. After work she takes care of her animals and on week-ends she sells cattle, which she has bought and raised for three-four months, at different markets or from home. At the present she is worried about  the disease attacking the animals (foot and mouth disease) which makes business difficult. Mar\u00eda Rosa has been a partner of \"Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir\" for approximately 3 years, and is requesting a loan of US$440 to buy fertilizers for her land as well as a young bull for a yoke as the sowing season is getting close.

She is married to Marzan, a painter, and is the mother of a child currently enrolled in elementary school. At this time, she is working hard to be able to support her child\u2019s schooling all the way through college. This is the dream of most Filipino parents like Jo-Ane, as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children. Jo-Ane is a licensed nurse.\r\n<p>\r\nJo-Ane maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 13,000 in sales every month. Jo-Ane also incorporates frozen cuts of meat and native meat delicacies to her current business inventory. She offers sweetened hams, pork sausages and cured beef.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 29,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Jo-Ane has been a member of Center for Community Transformation for four years now and regularly attends fellowship meetings.* \r\n<p>\r\nJo-Ane dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She hopes to see her child receive his own college diploma.\r\n<p>\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Sometimes he has to sleep in his kiosk, accompanied by his wife and his youngest son while his other children stay at home. \r\n\r\nThe income from selling fish is not much. The average of his daily income is about IDR 50,000. This income is not sufficient for Isai to meet the needs of his family, as he still needs to pay the school fees of his children. Therefore, Isai has tried to find other ways to increase his income by selling grilled fish. In order to do so, Isai needs capital assistance to buy the equipment to grill fish. In addition, he will also need to buy a variety of fish to grill. Isai is requesting a loan of IDR 4,500,000 from TLM. He hopes the application will be approved so he can improve his

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She was  able to gradually expand her retail store and her husband's farm was also able to earn additional income, which they used to build a separate shed for her retail shop. She is now very excited to get another loan  to expand the inventory of her retail shop. With the two growing businesses she hopes that she will be able to set aside enough savings for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":31127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock for her retail store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"WS","country":"Samoa","town":"Saanapu Tai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.583333 -172.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":15,"posted_date":"2007-05-30T01:38:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ofu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-13T17:04:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-08-14T09:16:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":42510},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-09-14T09:16:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":54376},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-10-14T09:17:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67143},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-14T10:16:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":81234},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-14T10:17:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96841},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-01-14T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":115380},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-02-14T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135031},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-03-14T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":157501},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-04-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182069},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":209550},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-06-14T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":237579},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-07-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-14T09:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":266506}],"funded_date":"2007-05-30T17:04:39Z","paid_date":"2008-07-14T09:02:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13230,"name":"Ninfa","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Ninfa  R.

He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and he is a member of the Houedome group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village farm the land after the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river drops. Their lands are rich and highly productive. Their main business activities involve growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these river valley dwellers is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and they spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. At low water they don\u2019t have any money left to pay the workforce that is essential for sowing the land available to them. The local practice of selling off the harvested crops does not provide them with security, moreover, it bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person to get hold of the money required to carry out the farming. Tired of this practice, they have asked for a loan of 100,000 FCFA ($200) to farm about one hectare of the aforementioned land.\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent,

His primary job is to provide adequate care to his fields.  For the past ten years, he has enjoyed developing his crops of bananas, coffee, citrus fruits, and other products that are native to the area.  Clearing his fields is difficult work, which explains why he does not like removing brush and pulling weeds.  Doing this type of work every day makes his arms sore.  Juan prefers to plant and harvest, as well as utilize the farming techniques that his father taught him.  Later on he hopes to continue growing coffee and bananas since these products are in high demand at the market.  In addition, he wants to build his own house and establish a business selling groceries.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the second time he has received a loan from MFP.  From the start, Juan has worked as an active member of his Communal Bank with the other members.  The loan he requested will be used to buy dozens of coffee plants and several sacks of compost for fertilizing his crops.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":568622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase coffee plants & sacks of compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2045.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195457}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T19:01:15Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":218934,"name":"Sergio Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sergio Alberto de 64 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 5 hijos y todos trabajan de manera independiente.

She is a villager who lives in Kbal Chrouy Village in Kandal Province. She and her husband are fishers who are able to earn a little income to support their family.

owns Comanche Auto Recyclers, a business that collects, crushes, and transports old vehicles to metal recycling centers.  Heriberto has been in the waste management industry since 1990, when he and his brothers opened a junk yard.  In 1994, they acquired a metal crusher, which launched Heriberto into the metal recycling business.  Shortly thereafter, he started Comanche Auto Recyclers, which he has been running ever since.\n\nFor years, Heriberto went from junkyard to junkyard with his crusher and trailer, looking for salvageable vehicles.  If he saw a vehicle with metal he could use, he bought the car from the junkyard.   If not, he went to the next place, spending fuel and time on the road.  A few months ago, Heriberto changed his business dramatically by moving to a new location where he could weigh scrap metal onsite.  Now, people who want to get rid of their vehicles take them to Heriberto, saving him the hassle of traveling with all of his equipment.  He pays for the vehicles according to their weight, with the price fluctuating according to the price of steel.  He crushes the cars, loads them onto his trailer and then he transports them to a metal recycling center in Seguin, Texas (roughly 40 miles east of San Antonio).\n\nTo make this expansion possible, Heriberto rented a new location where his business can operate, bought a portable building that serves as his office and a used scale for weighing cars.  Being hit with all of these expenditures at once strained Heriberto\u2019s cash flow.  Because Heriberto buys all of his cars in cash, it is important that he always have cash on hand.  This loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana provides Heriberto the operating capital to continue buying cars as he navigates his business through this transitional period.\n\nBefore relocating his business, Heriberto worked long days that often did not finish until 8 or 9 PM.  His new business model allows him to work fewer hours so that he usually finishes work by 6 PM.  As a father of six, he appreciates the opportunity to spend more time at home with his family.  Heriberto has two flatbed trailers that can store up to 18 crushed cars each.  He has two employees, one of whom is his son.  They currently make one trip a day to the recycling center in Seguin, though they hope that once word catches on of their new location, they will be fully utilizing both trailers.

She is the single mother of 5 children, and she works in one of the most common but productive trades in the city of Leon - as a tortilla-maker.  Although she is a native of Masatepe, Carazo, she has been living in Leon for 37 years.  She regrets very much that she was not able to get an education, but her parents did not have economic resources and she had to start working when she was very young.  She also migrated to cities other than her own in search of a better standard of living. She worked very hard for a long time as a domestic, but at age 47 she decided to start her own tortilla business. With an old tin pan, 2 bundles of firewood and a pound of corn, she started her humble business.  Now she has been working in her tortilla business for 8 years; she makes the tortillas and sells them in her neighborhood. Most of her customers are housewives who, from the early hours, await the opening of her business so that they can have her warm and recently made corn tortillas for breakfast.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe is taking this loan to buy corn, firewood, lime and beans.  These are the raw materials that she uses to make and sell her delicious tortillas.  One of her plans is to gradually make improvements to her house and to the kitchen where she makes the tortillas and cooked beans that she sells.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":935701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, firewood, lime and beans ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T04:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe Del Rosario\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":525,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832744},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242685},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381958},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095491},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710116},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403555},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428505},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613226},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452730}],"funded_date":"2011-12-24T18:24:40Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":370588,"name":"Yem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yem, 59, is a resident of Pouk district, Siem Reap province, where she grows rice and beans for her livelihood.

He enjoys sincerity and fair dealing.  He lives with Delilah, who is a housewife, their 3-year-old son and 4 cousins.  Together they inhabit their own house.  The activity that Carlos carries out is the sowing of yucca.  For this he relies on 25 hectares of land that he bought 10 years ago.  He has carried out this activity since that time.  There are 2 hectares already in production of yucca and 3 more hectares that are in the process of being sown.  In addition to this he sows rice in season and even rents the land for 200 new soles per hectare.  But for his own activity he contracts the support of up to 5 laborers so that they can help with the sowing and harvesting of his crop, earning a daily payment of 20 new soles each.  He likes life in the field and is accustomed to living in this manner, besides which it generates him profits to be able to settle the household expenses and to offer his family a better quality of life.  On the contrary he says that it does not please him when he loses a crop to some plague, but he is not discouraged and continues working.  He has plans to continue in his business and to expand his production of yucca.  This will be his second  loan with the institution MFP.  He waits for the loans contribution so that he can finalize his plans.  On the other hand, he promises to comply with the payment schedule as he did on his previous loan.  With the requested total of 1000 new soles he has plans to invest in the sowing of 1 hectare more of yucca to  expand his production and to be able to attend to the demand for his product.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":958046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy yucca seeds and contract laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-24T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magno ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400885}],"funded_date":"2011-12-25T16:21:55Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":378783,"name":"Victor Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Victor Francisco es casado, tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio los 3 a\u00f1os de educaci\u00f3n primaria, tiene 4 hijos los cuales estudian, se dedica a la artesan\u00eda a la elaboraci\u00f3n de sandalias para damas y ni\u00f1as, inici\u00f3 este trabajo por iniciativa propia y hasta el momento lleva  9 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para la compra de materiales como: piel, hilo, suelas, pegamento, etc. Espera en el futuro tener un negocio prospero.","en":"Victor Francisco is married, 37 years old and has a third-grade education.

This is 38-year-old Happiness M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two children ages two and seven years old. Happiness has been running a pharmacy since 2001. A pharmacy in Tanzania is traditionally a small store that has many glass shelves in which a variety of medicines are displayed, from antibiotic soap to malaria medicine. She works at the business for 13-16 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. She is requesting a loan of 750 USD in order to increase her inventory. Happiness thanks you for her support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

All of Maria's children attend school, and she hopes to be able to send them to the university some day. Maria recognizes the connection between the success of her business and the opportunities available to her children. She hopes her business will grow so that her children and nephews might have a better life. Currently, opportunities for socioeconomic mobility in the batey communities are scarce.

She carries out her business in the \"Chasquipampa\" zone, an area which is emerging as a new commercial axis for the city, and which is also an area of great expansion and growth, both in population and construction.

She does this work in an independent manner, using her home as a workshop. Her younger daughter works with her in spinning the wool. For her sales, she distributes her merchandise to various commercial retail stores and receives payment a week later. She comments, \"Alpaca wool does not concentrate heat; it is a good material that protects against cold and humidity. It regulates the temperature in areas where are used, alpaca wool does not contain lanolin; it is an advantage because it does not scratch or irritate the skin.\"  Her dream is to make garments on a wholesale basis for businesses, and to open a shop near her home.

They sell the rights to their future harvest to a wealthier person for a laughable sum so that they have enough money to be able to work their fields.<P>\r\n\r\nWeary of this system, Abel A. is requesting a loan of 140,000 F CFA so as to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing the above-mentioned crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"farming 1.5 hectares, raising corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T01:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821549},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357815},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046865},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27873.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938483},{"amount":49.11,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":25339.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396149},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904026},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126034}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T01:56:59Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":82918,"name":"Hilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hilda is a member of the Legion Village Bank.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":346622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials and a sewing machine.

Fe has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Fe joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Fe is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 16th loan taken out by Fe from PMPC.

This loan will be the 13th loan taken out by Gloria from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\\n\\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She lives with her husband and children in a monogamous family in the Torakabougou quarter of the town of Bougouni (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Having left school early, she began various types of money making ventures without much success. Finally she opted to buy and sell cereals. She learned this business from her husband. She runs her business in the Torakabougou market in Bougouni. With 5 years' experience, she is good at her job. In order to grow her business she decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso's loan programme. This is her second loan from them to buy sacks of cereals. The last loan was correctly repaid. She buys her produce in Bougouni town and in the surrounding villages from the producers. She sells her goods at the Torakabougou market in the town of Bougouni to retailers and consumers. With this loan she plans on earning a monthly profit of 65,000 FCFA that will serve to pay the interest due on the loan and provide for the family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in a rented house in the town of Patay.  \r\n\r\nEvery morning, Ovi wakes up early to fix breakfast for her children, who are in school. She spends the rest of the day caring for the fields where she grows food. Ever since she was a little girl she has learned to work the land - \"agriculture is part of who I am\", she says. She got her own land to cultivate some six years ago and now she has enough money to invest in the purchase of more seeds, in order to increase its profitability. \r\n\r\nOvi grows peas, potatoes and gladiolus. In two months she will harvest two hectares [almost 5 acres] of peas, and she already has buyers in the town's central market. The high quality of her vegetables has meant high demand and more profits. In a few years she will be able to acquire more land and build her own house. \r\n\r\nThis is Ovi's fourth loan with MFP [the Kiva field partner], and the communal bank that she belongs to has a very high level of savings. She feels both happy and accomplished as a part of this communal bank. Ovi will use the current loan to buy fertilizer to enhance the pea fields that she will soon harvest. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":609326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-03T01:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ovi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1748.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327020}],"funded_date":"2010-10-03T21:09:34Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

She lives with her child and husband in the Torkabougou district of Bougouni (in the Sikasso region).\r\n\r\nOuassa has an executive secretarial diploma but after she completed her studies she was unemployed for some years. In order to provide for her needs and help out her husband with the household expenses, she decided to build up some income generating activity. She thus often helped out her  friend with her business, in order to learn the trade of buying and selling \"pagnes\". She now has five years' experience in this business, masters it well and is in great demand.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain a consistent working capital, she decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso. With her loan she is planning to buy 12 pieces of highly decorative, embroidered and \"fancy\" printed pagnes. She gets her supplies in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). She sells them at home and walking around the various districts of Bougouni, for cash and on a retail basis, but sometimes on credit (the customer can choose to make repayments on a daily, weekly or monthly basis). Her customer base is made up of all types of social classes.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she is hoping to make a monthly profit of 100,000FCFA, which will allow her to improve her business and pay the interest on her Soro Yiriwaso loan.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Van Tai (ID Number 060035), 45 years old, joins the SEDA Fund. He would like to borrow 2,950,000VND to purchase more rice to seperate the husk from the rice. The rice bran is used as pig feed while Mr. Tai sells off the rice. As a active woM., his wife also helps him a lot in this. He has 2 children working as factory workers and thus, they contribute to the family's income. Mr. Tai really likes to join this Fund because he can repay the loan on an installment basis.

This strong business growth is the result of his strength in the three key dimensions of the business: sourcing, depth of product species, and marketing presence.

He is no longer enlisted and has worked as a security guard at the G4 company for more than eight years. He was trained as a soldier in Boane, which has one of the largest barracks in the country. He gets a military pension of 1500 meticals a month, and earns 3000 meticals a month as a security guard.\r\n\r\nHe lives in his own home, and plans to use the 15,000 meticals requested to buy construction materials in order to build a brick house. This is his third loan. His other loans were for the same purpose (8000 and 14,500 meticals). He learned about Hluvuku through friends and colleagues who live in Boane.\r\n\r\nHe's never had a loan from other banks or similar institutions, and he hopes to pay off the present loan in order to request further assistance, with the goal of completing and furnishing his house. He has voluntarily agreed to share his story on Kiva's website.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva
