She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of three children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. He has been running an auto rickshaw for the last year. \r\n\r\nFor many days Sobia's husband's rickshaw has not been working properly, and because of this he has been unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing rickshaw. Therefore Sobia has requested for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help her husband continue his business.

He sells a variety of ladies' and gents' clothes in the shop.\r\n\r\n He needs to purchase different types of clothes for reselling, but due to insufficient financial resources he is unable to purchase a new variety of clothes. Therefore, Zahida is applying for a loan from BRAC Pakistan, so that she can assist her husband in purchasing these clothes for his business. He can also increase the size of his business and earn maximum profit with the help of this loan amount.

He is only responsible to fulfill the needs of his entire family and manage to house hold. \nRuqaya's husband wants to buy different types of merchandises e.g. needles, threads, pieces of clothes etc for his business purpose, but due to insufficient financial resources he is not in suitable position to buy these merchandises to fulfill the needs of his business. Therefore Ruqaya has applied for Kiva group loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan amount will enable her husband to buy all above relevant items that fulfill the needs of his business.\nRuqaya is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

This will help her a lot and she will generate some income when she sells them.  \r\nHer dream is that God always give her life to keep taking care of calves so that when they become cows she can generate income from the sale of the milk and cheese she will make.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1569947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To buy two calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-01T10:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-01T10:40:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Lilian Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":20.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":22.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":24.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":27.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":31.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.29},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.12,"local_amount":21.12,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":21.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216519},{"amount":21.26,"local_amount":21.26,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":21.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817890},{"amount":23.19,"local_amount":23.19,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":23.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243255},{"amount":206.52,"local_amount":206.52,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":206.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526377},{"amount":27.91,"local_amount":27.91,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":27.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500865}],"funded_date":"2014-04-01T19:39:16Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:33:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Francis Gonzalez","image":null}},{"id":689406,"name":"Martin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martin es una persona trabajadora y emprendedora que saca adelante a su familia con el esfuerzo de su trabajo entonces su actividad econ\u00f3mica es la agricultura y el engorde de ganado, \u00e9l es una persona responsable por ese motivo le invitaron a participar en el banco comunal \u201cColque Orcco\u201d y en esta oportunidad  requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un ganado, \u00e9l agradece y valora el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas mensuales con mucha responsabilidad.

Despite having only a sixth grade education, she sells perfumes and catalog items to support house expenses.  Her husband is a mason and covers most of the expenses.  Dinora works hard to move forward her 1 and 3-year-old sons to whom she pays a lot of attention and are her motivation to keep moving forward.  \r\nDinora has been selling the products and getting a 25% commission from the price of each product for 5 years.  She sells to the houses in her canton.

This loan will also help her husband increase the size of his business and earn maximum profits.\r\n\r\nNasreen is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1574826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

Romeo was the eldest of four siblings and had to help his parents at work, as the family was very poor. Romeo is married; his wife works with him in the field. The couple has two daughters - aged 15 and 12 years old - who are in school and depend on Romeo.\r\n\r\nRomeo currently makes a living growing corn, something that he has done since he was a child when his father taught him. The family had no other way - except farming - to survive. As a children, Romeo also worked with his father in the cigarette factories.\r\n\r\nAs well as working in farming, Romeo is also working as a driver, earning him extra money. Romeo wakes up at 5 am and has to head out to the field where he grows corn. The land is three kilometres away; he arrives there on bicycle. Romeo does not have a fixed time for finishing work - he just leaves when he has done everything that needs to be done.

This was partly because of her parents' mentality, and partly because the family really needed an income for the home. Ana has been married for 33 years; her husband works in farming. The couple has six children: two are still minors and live at home; the others are all now married but two still live on the same land as the family home. Only the youngest two are still in school. Nobody else lives in the home, and only the couple's children depend on their income.\r\n\r\nAna has a business selling \"pupusas\" (a thick corn tortilla stuffed with cheese, fried pork rind, chicken, or refried beans). She learned this trade from her mother and decided to start her own business. Ana has now been doing this work for five years. She has no other job but is a housewife, as part of her duty as a mother. Ana makes the pupusas outside of her house, on the edge of the street, a very central place. Nobody else in the area offers this service. Ana works from 5.30 am until 10 am, and from 2pm until 6 pm.\r\n\r\nThis loan from \"Credi Campo\" will be used to buy more basic supplies such as corn, pork, cheese tortillas, oil, cabbage, sauces and more.

However, this time again, when the cabin crew interview was conducted in Imphal, she was selected. She didn't want to let the opportunity slip away this time. Therefore, she inquired of a few of her friends to give financial assistance because there is no one in the family who could financially support her. Her friends, who are also members of Kiva, recommended WSDS for giving education loans to those who need financial assistance. \r\n\r\nShe believes that with the help of this loan, she will be able to smoothly fulfill her dreams to fly high, and prays that such glorious work flourishes forever.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wishes to pay back the loan amount once she starts earning, provide financial help to her parents and ensure her other siblings get a good education, and earn her living.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1572452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to pay for a security deposit for cabin crew training so that she can support her parents financially.

He is married, has four children and lives in a large, traditional family in Wayerma I, a popular district of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nDramane has unsuccessfully tried many ways to earn money.  Four years ago he started to buy and sell white damask fabric, caustic soda, dyes, potash, etc.  He runs a small shop in Wayerma I, and is much sought after by his customers for the high quality of his products.\r\n\r\nAs his customer levels rose, and in order to satisfy their demands, Dramane started working with the field partner, Soro Yiriwaso, three years ago.  This will his seventh loan.  All the previous loans were fully and correctly repaid.

Javlon is a hardworking, kind person. He is 34 years old. Javlon is an attentive father and understanding husband. He has three children. Javlon's children are still very young and attend school. Javlon's wife, Inobat, is a homemaker. She doesn't work anywhere as she does not have a higher education. Inobat spends the majority of her time with her children as the children are the most important part of their family. Javlon and his wife want their children to grow up well-mannered and educated. For his family, Javlon works with all his strength.<br \/><br \/>Like other residents of his village, Javlon also practices cattle breeding. Of course, Inobat helps him with this. She fattens up the cattle while Javlon is away working in the fields. In addition to cattle breeding, Javlon also practices crop farming. He seasonally sows different types of crops. Currently, Javlon is preparing the land and cultivating it with fertilizers for sowing seeds. In order to prepare the land for sowing seeds, a certain amount of money is required. Unfortunately, the money which Javlon saved up all winter is not enough. Because of his financial difficulties, Javlon turned to Arvand for a loan. He really relies on the organization's assistance and thanks Arvand for their help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1564405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-01T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-01T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Javlon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":401.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":413.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":426.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":438.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":452.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":465.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":479.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":494.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":508.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":529.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":390,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":393.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875670},{"amount":84.36,"local_amount":401.7,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":405.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302895},{"amount":86.89,"local_amount":413.75,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":417.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585694},{"amount":89.49,"local_amount":426.16,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":429.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081279},{"amount":707.36,"local_amount":3368.39,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3398.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562159}],"funded_date":"2014-04-27T14:33:12Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":691901,"name":"Azatuhi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azatuhi is a young farmer from the Ararat region.

","en":"Despite her 54 years, Mutabar is a very energetic, hardworking woman who is not afraid of difficulties or obstacles. She raised her son alone. She has a secondary education. Like the majority of countryside residents, her main source of income is livestock breeding and processing milk. By raising cattle and selling milk and milk products of her own making, Mutabar supported her family, helped her elderly parents, and educated and married off her son. Now she has grandchildren who love her. Although her son is self-sufficient and can support his family and help out his mother, Mutabar does not want to be a burden to her son and continues to run her farm. Her grandchildren are growing up and as she could not give her son a higher education, she wants to make up for this deficiency and help her grandchildren receive the necessary education in the future. This is her dearest wish. <br \/><br \/>Mutabar wants to purchase cattle, additional feed, and all of the necessities for receiving great value from her business. However, she currently does not have enough funds. When she learned from acquaintances that she could take out a loan from a bank, she turned to Arvand for help. The received loan would be able to help her solve her problems. She is thankful in advance for the

Gilbert joined One Acre Fund in order to earn enough to feed his family. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member. Gilbert plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Gilbert\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to feed his family.  \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGilbert and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.

Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

She is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 48 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Rose has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nRose is married and has 6 children. She is 64 years old and is known as friendly and hardworking. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and savings group, and prayer group. Rose has been a farmer for 33 years. Rose described her harvest as poor last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\n\nRose first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Rose joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, and get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds to earn enough to feed family and send children to school. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Rose plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school and save for the future. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Rose's own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, was able to save money, and feed the family.  \t\t\t\n\nRose and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe field officer is also included in

She is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 62 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Catherine  has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nCatherine  is married and has two children. She is 46 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking and reliable. She is active in his community in groups such as the women's group, prayer group and burial committee. Catherine  has been a farmer for 24 years. Catherine  described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\n\nCatherine first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2013 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Catherine joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best prices for fertilizer and hybrid seeds to earn enough to feed family and send children to school. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Catherine plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Catherine\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nCatherine and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

the Kiva representative. Mary has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right of the photo in a dark brown flowered dress. Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 53 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\n\nMary is a reliable member of the community. She is married with four children. Mary is 57 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 35 years to support her family. In addition to this, Mary is very active in her community and is involved in the women's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. She described her harvest last year as poor. She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success she is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\n\nMary joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Mary joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, and get new farming methods to earn more and send children to school. Because she likes being a leader, and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers, Mary has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Mary's life because she has more profits from her harvest and was able to feed the family.  In the future, Mary hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, and buy a cow.  \n\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

She is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 58 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Priscilla has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving seeds and fertilizer for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an loan for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nPriscilla is married and has four children. She is 52 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking, reliable farmer. She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group.  Priscilla has been a farmer for 22 years. She described her harvest as not very good with One Acre Fund last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\n\nPriscilla is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Priscilla joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers by spreading the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Priscilla plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \n\nPriscilla and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe field officer is also included in

She is a responsible mother of three children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. He has been running an auto rickshaw for the last few years. For many days his rickshaw has not been working properly, because of regular use. He feels that most of its parts are out of order.  So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. Therefore, Suriya has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and not having a proper business location.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to purchase cigarettes, drinks and soap to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and increase her business. In the future, Kadiatu plans to expand her business more than ever. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1575014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

His wife stays at home and takes care of the household tasks. They are modest and hard-working and have hens and pigs, which are fed and sold afterwards. Only their 18-year old son lives with them and attend school. The others already got married. \r\n\r\nHe works in agriculture and has over 20 years of experience. His father taught him when he was a little boy that life only could be lived right if he had an honorable job. He also works when someone needs him and takes care of 40 cows who belong to his brother. The cows' milk makes junket and cheese, and he sells part of it and keeps the rest for their use. He does not always go to the same work place, so the distance he needs to travel every day changes. He sells part of the harvest and keeps the rest. His son gets involved in the activity and they work from 6am to 12pm and feed the cattle in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nHe will use the loan from Credicampo to buy 4 animals that he would feed and sell to obtain some income for the household. This way he would be able to increase his assets, expand production and provide his son with more opportunities. His dream is for his son to continue studying thanks to his support. He expects that one day, when he gets older, his son will help him with God's blessing and hard work.

She is married, and her life partner works in agriculture.  He also devotes himself to fishing and is a car mechanic.  They have four children, and all of them live with her.  The oldest children go to school.  A sister also lives with her.  Her children are the only ones that are dependent upon her.\r\n\r\nShe sells fresh fish that her husband gets from the river.  She has been doing this for two years.  The need to have income drove her to start this business.  Before this business activity she was only a housewife.  \r\n\r\nShe makes her sales by going house to house through her entire community.  She covers approximately five kilometers a day.  Her husband is the one who fishes so that she can sell.  Her schedule for selling is from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy fishing nets.

husband, Ajit. She is 32 years old and has a primary education. Her husband, who is 38 years old, is illiterate and can only sign his name. Her children are students of grade 4 and grade 10. They live in their own house in a small village, Sahapara, in Maynaguri in the district of Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nShyamali's husband is doing a small business, which is not running well. So, they are facing a financial crisis to manage all the necessities of their household expenses. Shyamali is a hardworking upbeat woman. She wants to join hands with her husband to run the family well. Since childhood, she has liked to sew. Currently, she is interested to start sewing women's clothing. So, she needs to purchase a sewing machine and thread, for which money is needed.\r\n\r\nShyamali has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner), who gives loans to rural women to start up businesses. She wants to utilise the loan to purchase a sewing machine. She will start stitching women's clothing.

Jyparkul has a secondary education. She practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 20 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Jyparkul's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow, 1 calf, 3 mares, 1 stallion and 20 sheep with lambs on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).

","en":"Burulkan is 66 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising three children. Burulkan has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, Burulkan practices livestock breeding. She started this business 46 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Burulkan's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cow, 4 sheep, 4 goats and 2 mares on her farm. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Burulkan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy mares to increase the size of her herd. Burulkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to buy a new house for her

He's already been doing this work for 2 years, and it is very rewarding to him because he earns a good income. In addition, ever since he was a child he has been working in agriculture.  He cultivates staple grains (corn and beans). Before he started this work he was studying for his degree.  Reynaldo works as an assistant from 7am until 3pm, which leaves him 2 hours a day to carry out his farming work.\r\n\r\nReynaldo is requesting this loan from CrediCampo to finance continuing work on his house.  Specifically, he will use the loan to buy 1,000 clay tiles for the roof and wooden beams, and also to pay for labor.  This loan will help Reynaldo to have a decent home.\r\n\r\nReynaldo's goal for the future is to continue to study and to get a university degree.  He knows that he can achieve this with effort and hard work.

She is illiterate, a housewife and a mother of one son. Her husband Shiben, 35 years old, is a motor driver by profession. Their son reads in grade two. They live happily in their own house.\r\n\r\nRina's husband is a car driver who works on a for hire basis.  He has no car of his own. But he has a small motorcycle repair shop in the market. He has been working on motorcycle repairs for more than 10 years to make his living. He started this business to increase his income and improve his living.  It was an impressive step forward and that's why he works hard.  But still, he is unable to give a better living to his family. Specifically, he can't give a good education to his children.

He stopped going to school because his father died when he was young. In addition, he was the older brother, and he was obliged to work to help the household. He managed to go to school through the 8th grade. Now he is married, and his partner does the household tasks. He has a son who is going to school.\r\n\r\nAll his life, Miguel has raised corn, which has provided his daily sustenance. He cultivates three hectares of corn and also beans, which were left to him by his father when he died. His land is at a distance of 8 kilometers from his house, and he has to walk every day. \r\n\r\nHe will invest this loan in buying a team of oxen, which he needs to be able to go every day to his land where he raises corn and beans.

She lives in the small village of Anandanagar in Maynaguri in the district of Jalpaiguri. Her husband is 51 years old.  Anita and her husband Suresh both have a primary education.  They have only one son. Anita could not provide an education for her son due to poverty. He works as a mason under a building contractor to earn bread for his family.\r\n\r\nHer husband is involved in a clothing business.  He purchases clothes from wholesalers and sells to his clients. Unfortunately, Anita\u2019s husband and son cannot give enough financial sustenance to the family with their small income.\r\n\r\nAnita stitches different types of bags and sells them in the local markets.  Her husband helps her to do this work.  She has chosen this business because it is profitable and the bags are in good demand in the market.  Anita has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) so that she can purchase more materials to make bags to sell in the market.  By selling the bags, the earnings are good and they are running their family.  She hopes that in the future, with the profit from the business, she will be able to open a bag shop in the market. She aspires to enhance her business so that she can secure her son's future.\r\n\r\nShe is very much grateful and thankful to BJS and Kiva for the financial assistance.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1568359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase materials to make bags","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-04-02T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-02T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-03T10:32:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}}]}
