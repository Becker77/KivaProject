Her husband is a constructer and he does different hired works in his village. In her farm, Narine has five cows, two piglets, 15 chickens and a large plot of land which serves her family as a source of fresh, pure and healthy vegetables (potatoes, beans, cucumber, tomatoes) and fruits (apples, plums, pears, etc.). All her farm goods (dairy products, meat, eggs, vegetables and fruits) she sells to re-sellers as well as using for her family to provide them with wholesome and mellow vegetables and fruits. \r\n\r\nNarine needs a loan in order to make her farm bigger and to buy two bulls and animal fodder.

She has built up a business selling general groceries and bags of cement. Many businesses in Sierra Leone operate on this basis; a customer might come to the shop to buy cement but will then leave having purchased some other things as well. Isatu works hard, 9 hours a day, 7 days a week. While she is proud of her business, she is sometimes challenged by slow sales.\r\n\r\nIsatu is taking out this loan to buy more stock for her business.

\r\n\r\nShe brews local wine and sells it to feed her children. She is the featured borrower for the group with her hand raised. They are five members in total. They call themselves Sonreipanrian Group. They live in a village that is close to one of the national highways and it is about 35 kms distant from the capital town of Manipur. It is one of the northeastern states in India.\r\n\r\nBuanthaolu belongs to a tribal community, and their tradition and culture oblige them to brew wine. This wine is used in their rituals and other festivals in their community. She uses this means to generate income for the family and make a livelihood for them. Lack of higher education compels her to make a living by manual work, and Buanthaolu says there is no excuse for sickness because her four daughters are still young and cannot assist their mother in her brewing wine business.\r\n\r\nShe usually purchases the materials like yeast, rice and other necessary requirements in stocks and brews wine. Her brewed wine is known in the entire neighbouring village and she has numerous customers. During festive seasons the demand is high and business is at its peak. She also supplies to the neighbouring villages and also sells the wine at home. She runs the business on her own as her children are still in school and she does not want to disturb them.\r\n \r\nWith the Kiva loan, she wants to purchase quality rice and bigger pots for brewing wine. She can then sell it at higher value because quality rice wine is valued and more expensive than the regular local wine. Until the children can find a way to replace their mother's brewing business, she has to continue because they don\u2019t have any other choice. She wishes to continue her brewing business and also plans to expand it.\r\n\r\nShe says thank you so much, Kiva, for your generosity and assistance. She wishes to continue building the relationship with Kiva and also assures that she will repay the loan on time and will also work with her heart and soul. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members are also engaged in brewing local wine.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1574858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase materials like quality rice, a bigger pot and firewood for brewing wine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bishnupur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-04-02T13:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-02T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buanthaolu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ahiamei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athaomei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-25T19:39:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":692123,"name":"Lanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lanie is thankful for the financial assistance extended to her.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.

All these women are engaged in income-generating activities to support their families. \r\n\r\nGuangdinglu lives with her husband and her two children. Her husband is a cultivator and his income is meagre and unreliable. It fluctuates and depends mostly on the produce and weather conditions. Relevant climate and arrival of monsoon at the right time again enhances the harvest.\r\n\r\nGuangdinglu brews local wine to supplement her husband's income and support the family financially. The tumult rice, which is left after brewing wine, is also used as pig feed and that is another means of making money, says Guangdinglu. By selling the regular local wine, one cannot generate sufficient income because it is cheaper. Quality controlled rice wine is in high demand and one can make huge money because it is more tasty and good for health. Business peak season is during the festive season of the tribal community, when the wine is used at different occasions for various purposes. During wedding receptions, house-warming parties, and new baby rituals in the family, local wine is used as sanctified liquor by the elders in traditional practices of the community. \r\n\r\nWith the assistance of the Kiva loan, Guangdinglu wants to purchase quality rice, more stocks of yeast and two bigger pots for brewing wine that she can sell and support the family. She also dreams of starting a new business in the town market by opening a grocery shop. She is working hard to fulfill her dreams. She will start saving from now onwards and will also repay the loan on time.  She says, \"Thank you so much, Kiva, for the generosity and unconditional help for the group.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in brewing local wine and selling it.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1574896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase quality rice, more stocks of yeast and two bigger pots for brewing wine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bishnupur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-04-02T13:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-02T13:50:07Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guangdinglu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lanchunglu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenthaolu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-20T23:38:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":692298,"name":"Timinandia Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Timinandja est compos\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement  de femmes monogames et polygames vivant avec leurs maris et leurs enfants.

Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nJuanita hopes to have another branch and dreams to have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1575408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for more eggs and grocery items needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-04-02T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-02T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juanita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":16666.65,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":16777.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479111600},{"amount":300,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":13421.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490806753},{"amount":300,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":13421.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504229522},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.71,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6711.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517516604}],"funded_date":"2014-04-03T05:47:07Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:55:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":692140,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon runs a business selling frozen and processed food products such as hot dogs, steamed buns, ham, stuffed meat, and other items.

 ","en":"Since she was small Yuli Steffani, in her innocence she knew that the work she was wanting was in the health field. As she played she dreamed about hospitals, helping people. Growing up she remembered that dream, some days more than others. At times it was distant due to a variety of circumstances. At times it appeared very remote after having moved away from this dream she had had for so long. Then life gave her a reason to not wait. It took a while for her to realize what life had prepared for her and she even got to thinking that her life was ruined. <br \/><br \/>One day she realized that she had all the abilities to achieve this, with a beautiful family who supported and believed in her. She got up and left the excuses behind, stopped worrying about the money and looked for the dream she had had. With a lot of effort and determination she finished her secondary studies and then out of curiosity started to enquire about what had impassioned her since she was a child. <br \/><br \/>Her family did not hesitate to support her and today she is studying to be an Assistant Health Administrator.

She is separated from her husband and has two children who live with her. One goes to school and the other has special needs. No one else lives with them and only the two children depend on her income. She studied up to Grade 6.<br \/><br \/>She works in a house as a domestic. She has been working for the same employer for the past 4 years so she feels confident of keeping her employment. She has no other economic activity. She travels 3 km to get to work and her hours are from 7am to 2 pm. <br \/><br \/>The loan Yanira is requesting is to purchase laminate to replace the laminate that is on the roof of her house.

Therefore Abida has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

This was as a result of a training conducted by VEP to the members, creating awareness that the use of paraffin for lighting is not only expensive but also affects health. Ngorongo Group became interested from then. They successfully paid back their first loan without default and this has uplifted their living standards.\n\nThe group has earned a good income from this and agreed to apply for a second loan to boost their stock, as this will help them conserve their surrounding environment and earn more income.Beth first from left is one of the group leaders who was among the first to purchase a cook stove(firewood). She discovered that she saves a lot of time as she doesn't have to look for firewood now and then,as a result she acts as a sales person on behalf of the group to create awareness on energy saving stoves.James at the center also has also benefited from solar lanterns as his children enjoy long study hours thus using that as a campaign tool for parent to buy for their children as they will perform better in school.

His general store is very famous in the town which is why his business is running well. His sales have increased a lot but he does not have sufficient stock to meet the demand.

Lahore, Pakistan. She is an active borrower of BRAC Pakistan. \r\nHer husband has been running a shop selling raw materials related to tailoring, which is the only source of income for the family. Many tailors and the ladies of his town like to buy laces, spools, threads, needles and packs of zippers from his shop. His customers appreciate his collection of laces. Currently he is interested in purchasing some of the latest variety of expensive laces to enhance his income but finds it difficult due to financial constraints. Therefore, Farida has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan, so her husband can buy stitching raw materials and expensive laces for reselling. This will not only help him to grow his lace selling business but will increase his net income and savings as well.

Therefore Tahira has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

She is only 21 years old and an illiterate housewife who only knows how to sign her name.  She lives with her husband and two daughters in their own house. Her husband Rafikul, 25 years old, attended school up to grade three. Their daughters are too young to go to school.\r\n\r\nHer husband is involved in farming and cultivates many kinds of vegetables to sell in the village market. Due to their low income, Nurbanu is unable to manage her family expenses. Her husband is struggling the best way he can all day, but fails to make more income than expected, so Nurbanu requested a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for cultivation of mustard in the same field to enhance the family income.

She completed high school in 2012.\r\n\r\nAlexandra has a beautiful son, now 4 years old, who is her life. She is preparing for her future, though a mother at the age of 19. She puts forth much effort so that her son can have the best she can offer, in economic or money terms.\r\n\r\nAt present, Alexandra is not working, but is seeking stable work, planning to do in the future what she has most wanted since she was little, to be a nurse. It is also her passion and aspiration to advance her son in life, in both economic and personal terms.\r\n\r\nAlexandra needs to utilize the Kiva agreement since she can't count on sufficient economic resources to be able to pay her monthly fees at Campo Alto. It is convenient for her to make monthly payments, since in the case of Kiva, this is the most economic method of repaying what she owes, and her money will be invested in her son's or the household's expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1570307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay the matriculation fee for a semester at Campo Alto.

He sells apples, bananas and oranges in his shop. Presently he is interested in offering more variety to his customers, which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. However due to the lack of money he finds this difficult. Therefore his wife, Kiran, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJulia hopes that her business will continue to flourish and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance

However, due to insufficient financial resources, he is unable to buy these items. Therefore, Sultana has applied for a Kiva loan from BRAC Pakistan so that she can financially assist her son to fulfill his business needs and enable him to buy merchandise for his business purposes.\r\n\r\nSultana is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

","en":"Ra\u00fal is 23 years old.  He studied at a vocational high school and focused on accounting.  He then began working in a store where he acquired sales experience and was able to become independent from his parents.  His parents could not pay for him to continue studying because of a lack of economic resources.  As time passed, he entered into a relationship and is now the father of two children; one son is 4 years old and the other was born only 3 months ago.  His wife is dedicated to the household chores and also makes a living in a tailor's shop and in business; she is the boss of her own small shop.  Together, they are a very united family.  They mutually support each other in order to reach their dreams and goals.\r\n\r\nRa\u00fal works at a hardware store.  He learned this type of trade previously during his three years of work experience at another shop.  He presently continues working and is motivated by his salary and the stable work; these things allow him to provide his family with their daily sustenance.  He works Monday to Saturday from 6:00am to 5:00pm.  He has to travel 6 km by public transportation in order to get to work.  If he leaves work late, he has to walk in order to get home.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be used to buy a motorcycle.

While she takes care of her baby, she finds time to manage her small retail store. \r\n\r\nShe aims to make her business profitable in order to help her husband in sustaining their necessities.

Teofilo decided to work in baking motivated by the profits and by the little competition that exists in the place where his business is located.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy materials to work in the bakery, seeing as he finds himself far from the businesses where he buys supplies to make bread.

This offers better service to his customers because with the help of the loan, he will begin to work four days per week. \r\n\r\nThe plans that he has are to extend his business, have a bigger establishment and buy a vehicle to be able to distribute the product in the outskirts of his town.

He is very hardworking and responsible with excellent principles and is very well-known in his community. He lives with his family, made up of his wife, who dedicates herself to the domestic tasks of their house, his two daughters and two grandchildren. He works in farming, especially in the cultivating of staple grains such as corn and beans. Santos grew up with his mother and grandparents. He reached an education level of 5th grade, the reason for which he did not continue his studies being because his mother did not have the money to send him to study. As time passed, Santos acquired experience and lots of knowledge about farming and it is this work which he now has made into his principle source of income.\r\n\r\nSantos makes a living through farming, an activity that he has done since he was very young. He learned it from his grandfather, who instilled good principles and values in him and who has brought him to be a very well-known and respected person in the community. Santos has 47 years of experience in farming, which he has made into his principle source of income. He now sells almost 60% of his harvests and what remains is kept for his family's consumption. The place where he works is 4 km from his house and he works from 7:00 am to 1:00 pm, from Monday to Saturday. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to to prepare and complete the process of collection of his harvest, in which Santos will have to pay for transportation to transfer the harvest from the field to his house and pay to rent a machine that shucks the corn. In this way, the process of preparation and storage of staple grains will be made easier. If it were not for the help of this farming machinery, the process would be delayed approximately a month, in which he would have to work every day. This guarantees Santos will be able to dedicate more time to his family.\r\n\r\nThe goals that Santos has for the future are to increase and diversify his crops. Regarding his daughters and grandchildren, he hopes to support them in all that may be necessary for their education and training, seeing as one of his grandchildren wants to prepare himself and study to be a doctor. Santos is going to achieve this with the good investment of his profits and the good management of the new loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1571732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to prepare and complete the process of collection of his harvest, in which he will have to pay for transportation to transfer the harvest from the field to his house and pay to rent a machine that shucks the corn.

She studied until 5th grade at school but couldn\u2019t continue studying because her family didn\u2019t have the means to support her, and also because as the older sister, she felt the need to help out with the family business.  As time went by, she decided to open her own shop selling basic household products.  She now offers basic grains as well.  She has 20 years\u2019 experience now and learnt everything from her mother.  She spent a lot of time establishing this business and she is highly motivated by the profits she makes.  It also has the added benefit that she doesn\u2019t have to leave home to do it, so she has plenty of time to look after her daughters who are studying in their final years at school.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan from CREDICAMPO to expand and improve her store.  The local festival season is approaching and there is always a high demand in her village during this time for her products and for candies.  She needs to stock her store so that she can offer the best service to her customers and generate some income.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to strengthen her business and have a bigger store where she can also sell food during the week, which will allow her to pay for her daughters\u2019 education until they graduate.  With the profits she makes, she will invest in her house to make improvements and continue to stock her store.  She is planning to ask for another loan in the future to buy a Nixtamal corn mill, as the nearest one she can use is 1 km

Yhennyfert began when she realized at a very young age that she wanted to get an education and help people in exchange for nothing at all.  She started meeting her goals very early on and shared with those who believed in her every moment of happiness, every wish, every goal and every objective.\r\n\r\nShe worked hard at school and stood out in subjects such as biology and mathematics which allowed her to create new ideas and establish a clear goal.  Although she suffered a lot in life she believed it was only temporary and the obstacles she met were in everyone's way.  Her perseverance allowed her to continue and not let the obstacles get in her way.\r\n\r\nYhennyfert finished high school and knew what she wanted to do.  She also thought about where she would get the money to accomplish her goal of continuing her education.  She had many support groups and did her best in the time necessary to raise the funds so she could study to be a nurse auxiliary.  Her idea for the future was based on her to capacity to contribute much knowledge regarding health care and prevention.\r\n\r\nHer intention was to get daily training to specialize in what she really enjoyed, which was health care.

She can now collect four tons of rice per trip and is really thankful for your support. She sells her business stock from 7am to 3pm daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nRosemary is now requesting an eighth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans (all of which she paid back successfully) to buy more stocks of rice. She managed to earn a higher income, which she used to buy a farm of three acres, invest back to her business and cover part of her children's school fees and home food expenses. Rosemary is running this business in association with her husband. She will use this loan to buy stocks of rice from upcountry to resell. She dreams of building a house and managing 15 tons of business stock. \r\n\r\nRosemary will share this loan with her group \"MAKOKA,\" which totals two members.

community. They are very poor and live in bad conditions. To earn a living he provides woodcutting services to others in his community in order to provide heat during the cold weather. He is the main source of income for his family.\r\n\r\nThrough his work he helps his family and gives them everything they need. The home that they live in is very old and is in need of renovation in order for them to live comfortably. The loan that Feriz is requesting will be used to do flooring and change doors and windows.

She used her previous loans, which have been repaid, to replenish her shop with up-to-date clothes. She earned a profit, which she used to pay part of her household expenses. Since she is single, most of her extra income pays for her family welfare.

Her husband has been driving an auto rickshaw and pays a daily fare because this rickshaw does not belong to him. He belongs to an ultra poor family and has been caring for his children. Now his children are growing older and their needs are growing as well. He was worried for many days about how to abstain from paying the daily fare, so he decided to buy his own rickshaw. \r\n\r\nFarzana has been accumulating savings for many days to buy a new auto rickshaw for her husband, but at the time of purchasing, their amount of money was short. Therefore, Farzana requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy a new rickshaw with the contribution of her savings. She hopes that now her husband will not have any need to pay daily fares, which will become the cause of an increase in income.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that now her husband will be able to earn more income, because now he will not pay a daily fare to anyone.

He always did his chores which were for that time very heavy.  He did them from a very early age. But as most know, life in the countryside is very hard for those who live it daily; to be able to have a plate of food one has to work very hard.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of time, he left school, since workers on the farm find it difficult to study with tranquility, and he decided to help his parents. He became a young man with very good principals and values, allowing him to travel to the capital and pursue employment. Eventually, he decided to complete his studies and he graduated with a high school diploma, thus, little by little, completing what at one time he had postponed.\r\n\r\nJohnatan Fernando's life was never very easy; he had to put forth considerable effort to be able to obtain what he wanted. But as always, with his goals in mind, eventually, he decided to become a technician in the maintenance and the assembly of computers in an institute. For that reason, he is now requesting the subsidy offered by Kiva so that he can culminate his studies and begin to help his parents.\r\n\r\nUp to the present, things have gone well and now Johnatan Fernando plans to complete his goals. He wishes to become a specialist and have his own house and a family, and achieve a grand career advancement.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1572085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester's matriculation fee at Campo Alto.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-04-03T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-03T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johnatan Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":148034.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202310},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":148034.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286451},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":148034.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225158}],"funded_date":"2014-04-03T16:54:50Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":692319,"name":"Rehena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehena is a rural housewife of Maynaguri in Jalpaiguri district.
