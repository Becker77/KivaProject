Unfortunately, her son is deprived of receiving an education due to their poverty and is a car driver to contribute toward the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been working as a motor mechanic for more than 10 years. He started this business to increase his income and improve his life. It was an impressive step forward for the family\u2019s well-being but he is unable to give a better life to his family, specifically he can't provide an education to his only son. So he needs to expand his business by purchasing more motor spare parts.\r\n\r\nKalpana has taken the initiative to help her husband.  She has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner).  They want to use the loan to purchase more motor spare parts.  She hopes that she will be capable of developing her family business and can generate more income to give a better life to her family.\r\n\r\nShe gives her heartiest thanks to the lenders (BJS and

She is married and has four children, all of school-going age. She enjoys farming because of the high production she gets. She has been doing it for 16 years. Her primary income source is milk, eggs, tea, maize, and vegetables. Her major challenge is insufficient capital for carrying out her projects.\r\n\r\nRussetta chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because of their favorable interest rate on their loans.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She has been in these businesses for seven years and is able to make a fair monthly profit. Sharifa starts her work from 5am to 10am where she cooks and sells bites. After that, she starts knocking door to door searching customers of her second business and end at 5pm daily. \r\n\r\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania, this is her twelfth loan request which she will use to rent a place for her bites and juices sales business. She needs to rent a nice place where she can serve more people and later on became a big restaurant. With the previous loans, all of which paid back successfully, she used the funds to restock her business with food cooking ingredients; fruits for making juice, baking flour, rice for making vitumbua and cooking oil. She bought a stock of fabrics and sarongs. With the improvement of her business, Sharifa earned an extra income which she used to buy her own bed, TV and covered part of home food expenses. She is really appreciating Kiva loan support which makes her smile. Sharifa dreams that one day she will be able to improve her family life.\r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group \"Kipawa\" which totals two members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the

Su esposa se dedica a criar aves de corral (pollos, patos, pavos) y cuida de sus 2 hijos varones de 6 y 3 a\u00f1os.\nLa venta de combustible, es un buen negocio, dice FURGENCIO ya que las estaciones de servicio quedan muy distantes y los moradores prefieren comprarlo en su local.\nCon este pr\u00e9stamo FURGENCIO comprara tanques para almacenar y transportar el combustible (gasolina); comprara un extintor para la seguridad del local y adem\u00e1s comprara lubricantes y aceites.\nLa \u00fanica forma de comunicaci\u00f3n que tienen es a trav\u00e9s del internet desde la casa comunal y su idioma es aut\u00f3ctono.\nFURGENCIO espera en poco tiempo acondicionar mejor el local de su negocio y ofrecer a sus clientes y amigos las comodidades, seguridad y mercader\u00eda que sus vecinos requieren.\n\nINFORMACION ADICIONAL\nFURGENCIO es el l\u00edder de la comunidad y del grupo AADAVI, formado por 16 personas 10 hombres y 6 mujeres.

He comes from a family of farmers, and in his community he sells fuel and oils to boat owners and residents of the village, who are then able to operate farm machinery and also generate electricity.  His wife raises birds such as chickens, ducks and turkeys, and also takes care of their two boys, who are ages 3 and 6.\r\n\r\nThe sale of fuel is a good business for Furgencio.  He says that gas stations are very far from the village, and the locals prefer to purchase their fuel from him.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he will buy tanks so that he can store and transport gasoline.  He will also purchase a fire extinguisher for the security of his shop, and also purchase lubricants and oils.  He hopes that soon he will be able to improve the condition of his shop and offer his customers and friends the comforts, security and merchandise that they need.\r\n\r\nThe only form of communication his family has is through the internet at a communal home in the village, and they speak the Autoctono language.\r\n\r\nHe is also the leader of his community and the head of the group AADAVI, which is comprised of ten men and six women.  In the photograph Furgencio can be seen raising his hand.  The photo was taken beneath the office, since the village is more than five hours from San Lorenzo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8000,"image":{"id":1572205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase fuel, tanks, oil, lubricants and a fire extinguisher.

","en":"Amriddin lives in the city of Khujand.  He is 33 and lives with his wife, daughter and son, as well as with his parents, two brothers and two nephews.  He has a large family.  His daughter is 8, his son is 10, and both are in grade school.  Amriddin works as a taxi driver, and his wife tends to their home.  There's a lot of demand for taxi drivers in Khujand; Amriddin has earned his living as one for 10 years already.  \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Amriddin is seeking to help his family.  Specifically, he wants to help his younger brother, who's a university student in his second year at Tajikistan State University of Law, Business, & Politics.  His brother is a smart and motivated young man who hopes to use his degree to work in the judicial system.  Because the price of a university education keeps going up with each passing year, Amriddin's family has decided to pay for his brother's last three years of tuition in advance.  Amriddin has decided to shift the financial burden of this payment onto himself, and is requesting a loan to pay for his brother's tuition.  This loan is crucial for Amriddin and his family.

He is the father of four children and is a very friendly person; always a good example to his children and family.  He has worked in agriculture since he was young.  He remembers very well accompanying his father to the fields when he was only 12.  He would take a machete, a file and a calabazo filled with water to help him do his work.  In this way, he gained experience and knowledge about agriculture, which has led to it being his main source of income.  He is very proud of his work as it has helped him look after his family.  His wife does the housework and his two children are studying at the moment at school.  His two older children are now living independently and are working themselves to look after their own families.\r\n\r\nFelix has been in agriculture for a total 45 years and he feels very happy working with the land.  His day starts at 5 in the morning when he starts to prepare his tools.  He only uses hand tools.  His place of work is 4 km from home.\r\nHe will invest this money in hiring a piece of equipment to prepare in the correct way his last harvest which has been recently cut.

She has been engaged in a fishing business with her husband for several years now. This is their main source of income.\r\n\r\nMirasol is asking for a loan to buy new fishing nets and gasoline for the fishing boat.

She and her husband  have four children. Anar has received secondary education. By nature she is very conscientious, outgoing, optimistic, and honest. Together with her husband, Anar raises livestock, having launched this business 28 years ago by buying cattle for 8,3000 KGS. Thanks to Anar\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes four dairy cows, two bulls, and one horse. Her monthly income from selling milk is 9,200. In order to develop her farm further, Anar has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan to increase her livestock by buying cows. Anar plans to use the revenues from her loan for an additional expansion of livestock.

She has a high school education and is well respected by her neighbours, who refer to her as a kind and hardworking woman. Busadat and her family have been raising cattle as their primary source of income since 1990. They have two milking cows, 10 sheep and four horses. Busadat started this business with 5,000 KGS, and thanks to her hard work, she has been able to develop and broaden her business, and now brings in about 15,000 KGS per month, which is her family's main source of income. With the goal of further developing her business, Busadat has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan to purchase two milking cows. She plans to use profits from the loan for further improvement of her business, and in the future she wants to purchase a car for her family, to build a shed for her livestock and to buy two yurts for living in at the mountain pastures during the summer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1577387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"\"The first May\" village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-04T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-04T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":56.16,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Busadat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":648.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":648.15,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-24T08:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":35316.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947224},{"amount":925.93,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50452.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436181},{"amount":869.76,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50452.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":56.16,"payment_id":636161050}],"funded_date":"2014-05-04T03:53:30Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":690581,"name":"Martha Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Lorena naci\u00f3 en una comunidad cerca de el Sauce a los de 18 a\u00f1os se caso y ha procreado  5 hijos de este matrimonio  con mucho esfuerzo  ella y su esposo han adquirido unas tierras y han construido una peque\u00f1a casa para vivir, su fuente de  ingreso para mantener a su familia es  el cultivo de granos b\u00e1sicos y  tienen unas cabezas de ganado y crianza de cerdos , en la comunidad donde ellos viven no cuenta con energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica, y ella desea tener luz en su casa para poder ayudar a sus hijos con sus tareas por la noche ya que en el d\u00eda los dos trabajan, por eso solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para poder comprar un panel y mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia","en":"Lorena was born in a community close to El Sauce.

She has nine family members, and the significant source of income they have is from agricultural activity. Sadly, for lack of economic resources and because she had to start working at a very young age, Gultamze was unable to study for a professional career.  Gultamze and her husband work hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing potatoes. They always have high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. As the existing income is not enough for nine family members, she decided to expand her agricultural business. After several unsuccessful attempts, Gultamze applied for the credit to MFO Credo. Her request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. With the loan 3,000 GEL she will purchase goats, produce and sell cheese, and also sell lambs for a good price. She is a very enthusiastic and hardworking person with a great desire to provide her family with better living conditions.  This credit will be a great support for the family. Gultamze is thankful to Kiva lenders for giving her a chance to increase productivity.

She is married, with two children. She will use her Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during rice production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase her production. With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business, so that, in the future, she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.  \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). \r\n\r\nDespite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nUrwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

David provides passenger transportation for a living via a motorcycle taxi that he bought with savings. Previously he worked as a driver of another rickshaw but he has had his own taxi for a year and works as comfortably. However, the quality of his vehicle is not ideal as he bought it used and it needs certain repairs. He likes his business because it allows him an income with which he can meet his family expenses.

She wanted to work in a hospital, since 2 years ago, she had worked in a hospital in the archive next to the emergency room. She saw that in health care, people are needed to offer good service, humility, and a friendly hand. There are moments when people need help from others. One has to look deep inside to recognize that these are sick people with needs and difficulties and they lack sufficient resources.\r\n\r\nTo be able to do this, Marisol needed to prepare herself, study, and continue her contacts in the health field, if she were to receive better job offers in hospitals and clinics. But she must also continue caring for her children, preparing them for the university, since without a professional title it is very difficult to obtain a good job.\r\n\r\nMarisol is grateful for the agreement with Kiva that could help her. With the Kiva loan, she will accomplish an important goal in her personal life.

young children. Buraima has a secondary education.  More than 20 years ago, she started her business from nothing and developed it together with her husband, who is in charge of the business. Currently, Buraima owns 2 dairy cows and 10 sheep. She fattens the cattle in two cycles, first on her own farm and then in open fields. There is also a sharecropper who uses 2 hectares of the family land, mostly growing watermelon, melon and cotton. The profit is about 20,000 somons (KGS). There is also additional income in the form of child allowances in the amount of 2,500 som (KGS) per month and rent from two containers in the amount of 1,500 som (KGS) per month. Buraimi plans to purchase cattle: 6 heads of sheep and one calf intended for fattening. Part of the money will be spent on the purchase of fertilizers and seeds. In the future, Buraimi wants to educate her children and to complete the renovation of her home. All this can only be realized with the expansion of her business."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1576719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak - Tash village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-04T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-04T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buraima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":648.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":648.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":648.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":692789,"name":"Vannak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vannak (in photo) is 34 years old and lives in a village across the Mekong twenty kilometers from Phnom Penh City.

Aida has had a secondary education for many years; from 1998, she has engaged in agriculture. At first, she only had one borrowed cow, but today her farm has 4 dairy cows, 1 horse and 10 sheep that brings her a profit of 20,000 som (KGS) per month. Aida also farms corn, rice and vegetables. In the summer, she brings the cattle to the fields. In the winter, she keeps them on the farm, where she has created all the necessary conditions. Aida's spouse has a secondary education and actively helps her with her business. She has turned to the Bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for the first time in order to buy cows.

","en":"Amonidin is an elderly villager from the Vakhsh region. He has a higher education. He works in the tax office of the district. At the same time, he has been working as a farmer for 18 years, like all the other villagers. Amonidin lives in the village with his wife, children, in-laws and grandchildren. He is 68 years old, but still feels good and continues to work. Circumstances have forced Amonidin to apply for a loan. The thing is that his grandson Sobirchon has been studying in his freshman year at the State University of Kurgan in the Technology department. When he started school, Amonidin was helping pay by himself.

This is where he went to elementary school and later started working the land with his father.  He met his wife when he was 20 years old, and together they have 5 children, 4 of whom are in school.  With a lot of effort, he acquired a property and started to work as a farmer, cultivating staple crops like coffee.  This is one of the main activities that he does.  In his community there is no electricity; to get light at night they use lamps, which have caused illnesses in their children because of the smoke.  In addition, they have exposed them to danger, causing accidents.  This is why he wants to take a loan to buy solar panels so that he can give his family better living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":193.18,"image":{"id":1572952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a small solar energy system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2014-04-04T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-04T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":423.89,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":192.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":231.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":193.18,"local_amount":192.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":193.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624403869}],"funded_date":"2014-04-05T16:51:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":692817,"name":"Hed Al- Waytat Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hed Al \u2013 Waytat is a group of four women, living in Sana'a, Yemen.

Jhunarani is a 46-year-old lady living with her husband. The lady standing with her raised hand is Jhunarani. Her husband works as a farmer. She runs a grocery shop to help her husband financially. She sells rice, grains, lentils, edible oil, spices, biscuits, soap, detergent, hair oil, etc. in her shop. She has developed a very good relationship with her customers in the village. Jhunarani likes the fact that she can cater to the needs of the people in her village. \r\n\r\nShe has a plan to make her shop bigger and keep multiple things in her shop to satisfy her customers. She also wants to purchase the items for her shop in bulk directly from the wholesalers, for which reason she has requested a loan to purchase items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, soft drinks, wheat flour, grains and other household consumables. \r\n\r\nJhunarani, along with her group members, has requested a loan amount of 130,000 INR.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1576503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, soft drinks, wheat flour, grains and other household consumables for her shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chandikhole, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-04-04T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-04T22:40:06Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhunarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Uttam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bebina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khilika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":690636,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a solar system.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":279,"posted_date":"2014-04-04T22:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-04T22:40:06Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":512.82,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":110.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":121.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":147.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-07T13:42:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":692847,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is a thirty-four year old M-Pesa agent (a mobile-phone-based money-transfer service) and retail shop proprietor at Mombasa, Kenya.
