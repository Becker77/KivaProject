She has two children. Milagro grew up with her parents who worked in agriculture and livestock. Eventually she found work in an eatery in the town where she made pupusas [thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, fried pork rind, chicken, or refried beans]. This is where she gained her knowledge and experience. \n\nAfter a good while she decided to set up independently and took out a loan to buy a griddle for making pupusas. She started her business at the weekends and started building up customers. Now she works in her pupusa stall every day and her younger daughter helps out. Milagro works in the business selling pupusas every day of the week, from 3 in the afternoon until 8 at night. She does her work with the help of her daughter and she has 10 years' experience in the business. She learnt the skills when she was working in an eatery in the town where she worked hard and was very attentive and showed a willingness to learn everything she was being taught. \n\nThe money will be used to buy a larger griddle for making pupusas, because the one she has is very small and the demand from her old and new customers is growing every day. This has put her under pressure to to buy better equipment so she can do the work more easily. This will give her better profits which will be used to improve her home. By doing this she will improve her quality of life and they will have better living conditions.\n\nHer plans for the future are to build bigger premises where she can develop the pupusa business better and set up a dining room so she can give her customers a better service, since a lot of them are asking her to change her menu. As for her children, she really hopes they will get on and overcome any obstacles in life and intends to fully support them as much as she can.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1561035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They decided to organize as a group so that they could look for financing alternatives, such as securing a loan from Pana Pana.  This would enable them to improve their businesses and their incomes.  As a result, they can improve the living conditions of their families and provide for their basic needs such as food, education, and shelter.  <br \/><br \/>Narda, age 26, is a jovial woman who is married and has three children.  Two of them are in school and the youngest is only six months old.  In order to have an income of her own, Narda established her business two years ago at the municipal market in Waspam where she sells provisions.  Her business is set up on the edge of the street and there she offers bananas, cassava, \u201cquequisque\u201d (a tuber similar to taro root), and plantains on top of black plastic bags that are laid out on the ground like a tablecloth.  She does not have a cart or a table on which she can place her merchandise.  Narda is requesting her first loan so that she can increase her inventory of products, which would allow her to sell more and improve her earnings.  Her dream is to build a concrete house and see her business grow.<br \/><br \/>Rosaura has also been selling provisions at the municipal market in Waspam for approximately four years.  Her business is on the edge of the street as well.  Her products are laid out on the ground because she does not have a cart or a table on which to place her merchandise.

Her dream is to grow her business.  <br \/><br \/>Merosalinda is also a member of the group \u201cWanplan\u201d.  Three years ago and with a small amount of her own capital, she started a business of selling fish at the municipal market in Waspam.

They also work with natural dyes, and their products are very lovely.\n\nJulia is a younger member of the group. She is 23 years of age, single and eager to excel. Like most of the women of San Juan La Laguna, Julia learned to weave when she was a child. She currently owns a textile shop along with her mother. Julia is requesting a new loan in order to sustain and grow her business. She plans to purchase yarn and then using natural dyes, transform it into beautiful colors. She will then weave it into beautiful fabrics that will become scarves, shawls and table runners. Julia is very pleased to participate in this business because it allowed her to finish high school and enter college. She is studying business administration. Julia sets a wonderful example for the other women in her Trust Bank.\n\nDuring the monthly meetings, the women not only make payments on their loans but also receive educational training from a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. For many of the women, it is the first time that they are learning in an educational setting, as they began working as children and did not have the opportunity to attend school. The ladies learn about business administration, marketing and budgeting as well as women\u2019s health and leadership, self-esteem and empowerment.\n\nKiva investors are greatly appreciated by Friendship Bridge clients like Julia. Armed with small loans and educational training that Friendship Bridge calls \u201cmicrocredit plus,\u201d the women can step more confidently and empowered into a more successful future. Their families and their community will realize benefits as well.

","en":"Yuly Paola is 22 years old.  She currently lives in Bogota with her aunt Deisy, who is like her mother.  With six siblings, in total they are seven.  Her aunt has always been her mother and head of the household.  Yuly Paola has always made an effort to become someone in life.  Her aunt was able to send her to school through primary school, and since then she has paid for her studies herself, and she was able to finish.  Since she finished school, she has had many problems, because she had a daughter but the father took her with tricks and lies.  There was a process, and unjustly, he was given custody.  This was very hard for her until she made the decision to continue with her studies.  \n\nIt has been hard for her because there is a process in another city to get back her daughter Laura Valentina, who was taken from her unjustly.  Since she has started studying at Campo Alto, her life has totally changed.  Since she has all the abilities, she has always wanted to study nursing, and now she is doing it.  She has finished her first semester.  Thanks to Campo Alto, she works in the family house.  There she has been able to study and continue at Campo Alto.  It has been very hard for her since she has to help her aunt to pay rent and utilities.  Many things have happened to Yuly Paola to get her to study nursing now.  \n\nShe says that she wants to continue with her studies and become a professional to help society.

Segundo was born in the city of Latacunga, in Eloy Alfaro parish, a neighborhood that is very humble but full of opportunities. He lives in his own home. Ever since he was very little he was always a very hard worker. Because of the fact that the financial situation at home wasn't very good, he would go out to work with his parents. He was able to finish primary school with lots of effort and sacrifice. From there he went to work in a car repair shop as a mechanic's helper, which is where he started to learn waht he liked the most. He completed some courses in order to become a professional mechanic, and this profession is what helped him get ahead for a long time, enabling him to provide for his family. Today his wife Mar\u00eda is proud to have Segundo by her side because he is a fighter and a very responsible person who works hard every day in order to give her and their children everything they need. Mar\u00eda and Segundo have five beautiful children that are always playing all over the house and fill their parents with joy.\n\nSegundo and his wife work making bricks in the neighborhood of Guapulo, which is very well known for this business. He learned it from his parents, who taught him how to make bricks as a child. He works between six and seven hours per day with his wife's help. He believes the hardest part of this business is the effort it entails. \n\nSegundo's greatest dream is to see his children grow up healthy and become great professionals. \n\nCurrently Segundo needs to buy some boxes and more materials for making bricks. That is why he is requesting a loan, so that his sales can keep increasing as they have been for the past months. That is why Segundo is requesting this loan and he is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making growth possible in his family and personal

always had the big dream of studying nursing, something she still couldn't do at her young age. But time would always reaffirm that this would be the best major she could choose. What she didn't understand until now is that nursing is more than a major, it is a nice vocation. Over time, GOD sent her one of the best examples and her biggest inspiration, her son Juan David. He is a little angel who little by little would teach her about the real meaning of life. Despite the difficulties and obstacles that she is going through because of Juan David's health, today, after 11 years, Diana understands that GOD had set her destiny and that nursing is her passion and that her best patient is her son. He makes everyone happy with his smile, and he makes her understand once again that nursing is the gift of giving while receiving nothing in return.   \r\n\r\nSince Juan David was born with serious health problems, Diana has fought for 11 years for his well being, which she has achieved with a lot of therapies. That is why Diana never loses hope that one day she will finish her major in nursing to be able to offer Juan David a better quality of life for her and for her home. The Kiva subsidy would be a big help, since with her son the expenses are increasing a little more and when she makes the payments it is very complicated for her to pay for the household expenses. That is why she wants to have the contract with Kiva so that she can happily finish her major that she loves so much.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1565292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester's tuition.

build a secure future for their families. They formed a group named Maa Mangala Self-Help Group. The members of Maa Mangala Self-Help Group are all women from the district of Jajpur in Odisha, India. \r\n\r\nOne of them is Puspalata, who was selected as their president. In the picture, the lady standing with raised hand is Puspalata. \r\n\r\nPuspalata is 33 years old and lives with her husband and her four children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in the activity of cultivation for a long time. \r\n\r\nShe got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighbourhood and told them about her plan.

The family has a farm and she works hard on the land, growing and selling cereals locally. However the income isn't enough to cover all their daily expenses, which is why Gulnazi decided to expand her activity. To do this, she has requested a loan that was approved under the terms of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo that gives people a chance to start or re-start a businesses. With a loan of 10,00 GEL, she will buy fruits and vegetables to sell. She will occasionally go to the capital and buy products at wholesale prices that she sells for retail prices. This will give her a chance to earn more income and become financially independent. Her goal is to save enough money to provide a better future for her son. Gulnazi thanks you for your support.

He is married and has two children. He lives in a village together with his family. Uktam has worked with field crop cultivation for a period of 15 years already. He gets a good income from this business. He grows crops such as onions, corn, tomatoes and so on. His family helps him with the work. Uktam also works as a carpenter and master house builder. He receives an acceptable income from this work. \r\n\r\nCurrently Uktam would like to renovate his house, installing good quality windows and doors.

He is married and has three children. Botir lives in a village with his family. \r\n\r\nIn order to have an income for living, Botir has his own business. He has worked with growing crops for a period of 10 years already, and he also grows onions. After he has gathered the harvest, he goes to a large bazar and sells it there. Earlier he worked with dekhan farming, but then he decided to sell his harvest. As an additional income, Botir has another business. He has a few heads of cattle, which he breeds for selling. \r\n\r\nCurrently Botir would like to expand his business of field crop cultivation. However he does not currently have sufficient private funds to purchase seeds for sowing crops. Therefore he turned to Arvand and would like to take a loan to purchase seeds for sowing.

He learned farming from his father and he learned sorbet selling from a friend who offered him a job. Currently this work is going very well for Nelson. The place where he farms is at a 5 minute walking distance from his home, and the other place where he works takes a 30 minute bus ride. He does his farm work from 6:00 a.m. until noon, and when he leaves to sell sorbets he works from 2:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from CrediCampo will be used for preparation of the land to plant corn, to pay the rent for the land, and to buy farming supplies. With the help of the loan he can cover these necessities. \r\n\r\nNelson's plan is to continue working so he can improve his home. This is his biggest dream, together with his wife. The loan will help them to improve corn production and later sell it, and to save little by little to improve their home. They will achieve all of this, working together for one common goal.

He has worked as a builder for a long time. He studied up to second grade of elementary school, but he had to stop going to school to help his parents on the farm. Later he met his partner who is a very hardworking woman and with whom he has a 17-year old daughter and a 12-year-old son. His wife works as a homemaker and his children attend a school that is located two blocks from their home. Jesus has worked as a builder for 15 years. Previously he worked as a builder's assistant, but he learned how to do the work well and this is how he makes a living. He also does agricultural work. He wants to use the loan to buy a horse because right now they are at a good price and he wants to take advantage of this offer because when growing season begins, the prices go up. He needs a horse to carry water to the place where he works, which is far away. In the future, Jesus want to buy cattle to generate income for his family, as he does not have a permanent contract at work. He also hopes to be able to leave his children an inheritance which they can make money from and which will help them to continue their educations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1573102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a horse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-05T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-05T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":266.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":233.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517527080}],"funded_date":"2014-04-11T19:15:30Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T10:25:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":690725,"name":"Marlene Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Telas de distintas texturas y colores adornan la vivienda de Marlene Rivera.

garantizarles la educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, despu\u00e9s de graduarse del colegio a los 16 a\u00f1os, Angelica  inicio el primer trabajo, todo esto con el fin de lograr reunir el dinero necesario para iniciar los estudios superiores, Angelica siempre se interes\u00f3 por el tema de la belleza, le apasionaba la idea de poder a trav\u00e9s de masajes y tratamientos ayudar a las personas a aumentar el autoestima, sin embargo no lo consideraba una carrera muy seria y por ende la principal opci\u00f3n era estudiar Derecho, sin embargo esta era una carrera muy costosa y ser\u00eda muy dif\u00edcil para ella reunir el dinero necesario, transcurri\u00f3 el tiempo y debido al extenso horario de trabajo para Angelica fue muy dif\u00edcil organizarse para iniciar los estudios, y adem\u00e1s de ello el dinero que recib\u00eda por el trabajo apenas le alcanzaba para ayudar en peque\u00f1a medida con los gastos de la casa y cubrir los gastos personales, as\u00ed transcurri\u00f3 el tiempo y a la edad de  veinte a\u00f1os Angelica se cas\u00f3, para ese entonces ella trabajaba y los gastos hab\u00edan incrementado significativamente.\n\nDurante los siguientes tres a\u00f1os ella continuo trabajando  y en la vida de casada el dinero que le sobraba era muy poco, adem\u00e1s de ello para ella era muy importante trabajar duro para en un futuro poder ayudar econ\u00f3micamente a la familia, pero principalmente a la madre. \nEn la actualidad Angelica tiene 23 a\u00f1os, ya logro matricularse e iniciar los estudios superiores en el \u00e1rea de

lejano iniciar un negocio en sociedad con la hermana quien estudia belleza, el sue\u00f1o es lograr establecer un centro de belleza integral donde adem\u00e1s de realizar procedimientos est\u00e9ticos tales como masajes relajantes, reductores, mascarillas y dem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n se pueda proporcionar a los pacientes todo lo correspondiente al cuidado f\u00edsico tal como manicure, pedicura peluquer\u00eda etc. \nPor ahora para Angelica es de gran esfuerzo poder costear los estudios, ya que aparte de las mensualidades, ella debe comprar ciertos materiales y aditamentos para las pr\u00e1cticas, es por eso que ella solicita del convenio kiva, adem\u00e1s de ello debe disponer de ciertas horas en la noche para la realizaci\u00f3n de las tareas y talleres correspondientes a las clases, Sin embargo cuenta con todo el esp\u00edritu y voluntad para no desfallecer y culminar de la mejor manera la carrera en Cosmetolog\u00eda y est\u00e9tica.","en":"This is Angelica, a young woman of 23 years of age. Her childhood and part of her teenage years were a bit complex, as her mother, after a marriage of 18 years, was left alone with her and her three siblings. Even though Angelica's mother worked hard, she could barely guarantee her children's basic education. After graduating from high school at age 16, Angelica started her first job with the goal of gathering the money required to begin her higher education. Angelica was always interested in the topic of beauty and was passionate about the idea of helping people improve their self esteem through massages and treatments. However, she did not consider this a very serious career and her main choice was to study Law, which was nevertheless a very expensive degree and it was very difficult for her to gather the required money. Time went by and due to Angelica's extensive work schedule, it was very difficult to make the arrangements to begin her studies. In addition to that, the money she was paid for her work was only enough to help to a small extent with her household expenses and to cover her personal expenses. Time went by and Angelica got married at the age of 20. At that point, she still worked and her expenses had increased significantly.\r\n\r\nDuring the following three years, she continued working and there was barely any money left over in her married life. It was very important for her to work hard in order to be able to help her family in the future, especially her mother. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Angelica is 23 years old. She was able to register and begin her higher education in the field of Cosmetology and Comprehensive Aesthetics. Her initial goal is to take advantage of her studies, obtain as much knowledge as possible and finish her studies to become an excellent professional. In the not too distant future she would like to start a business in partnership with her sister who is in beauty school. Her dream is to be able to open a comprehensive beauty center, where in addition to conducting aesthetic procedures such as relaxing and reductive massages, face packs and so on, patients could also receive everything related to physical care, like manicures, pedicures, hair styling, etc. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, it is a great effort for Angelica to be able to afford her studies, since in addition to the monthly fees, she must buy certain materials and  devices for her training. This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan. She must also make some time available in the evening for doing her homework and  workshops related to her classes. She possesses nevertheless all the spirit and will power not to give up and to finish in the best possible way her degree in Cosmetology and Aesthetics.

She works in her business from 06am to 06pm daily and is able to make a very good monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fifth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans, all of which she paid successfully, to open her current charcoal business and increased her poultry business with 50 chicks. She is so progressive and is a hard working mama. With the increase of her business stocks, Mariam got an extra income which she used to connect electricity to her family living house, bought a fridge, a TV and a digital deck (King\u2019amuzi). She really appreciates Kiva's loan support which makes her feel a person. Her family life has improved and is better than before. Mariam dreams that one day she will be able to connect her house with water and improve her businesses. \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group \"ON TIME\" which totals two members.
