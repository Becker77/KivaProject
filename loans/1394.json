As an entrepreneur, Marble inspires young women in her community to continue their education. \r\n\r\nMarble knows that she could sell more chickens each month, but because all her income is needed to provide for her two children, she is unable to use her current profits to expand her business. With this Kiva loan, she will be able to grow her business by buying more broiler chicks and chick feed. Marble hopes to use her increased profits to care for her two children and keep them in school.

Jeimmy achieved things that they could never do. The years went by and, in ninth grade, Jeimmy almost failed. This was very sad for them but, with the help of friends and teachers, Jeimmy did it. She was very happy to graduate from high school with her classmates and make her parents and brother so happy. Jeimmy had the support of her family, classmates and teachers and so could study tenth. She also studied eleventh grade, which was a dream for her as she never thought she would achieve this.\r\n\r\nJeimmy knew that she had to keep following her path and she would be able to achieve her great dream and now how the opportunity to study.

An increase in profits would also mean that she will be in a better position to provide for her family and improve her standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1577889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a poultry enclosure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Nkayi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":305,"posted_date":"2014-04-06T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-06T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loveness","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224227},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517512425},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542486809},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681310971}],"funded_date":"2014-04-09T22:13:32Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:13:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":693689,"name":"Dzame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dzame is a married woman with six children, five of whom are in school and one underage.

She is illiterate but can sign her name while her husband is totally illiterate and cannot even sign his name. Her poverty, ignorance and lack of knowledge have not allowed her to receive more education. Now Nayantara is a mother of three children and they all go to school. \r\n\r\nShe is engaged in animal husbandry. Now she wants to buy a dairy cow. She has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase a cow so that she can sell milk and milk products in the market. Her husband is running a small fish business. Both Nayantara and her husband work together and divide their work. They work long hours so that they can give a bright future to their children, a future that is not affected by poverty and ignorance. This loan will give them an opportunity to make their dream true. Now, Nayantara lives in a Kaccha house (made of straw and mud), but in the future, she will try to make a Pakka house (made of bricks and cement) with her business profit.

She has four children. \r\n\r\nNow her acquired skills and her father's occupation has become a source of income for her own family. She also works with dekhan farming, from which she gets vegetables, greens and fruit as daily food for the family. She has already brought \"bread\" to her family through livestock breeding for many years. Her husband and children help with this. \r\n\r\nBecause of current difficulties with finances, Mujassarhon decided to take a loan and entrusted MDO \"Arvand\" with her future earnings and welfare. For the loan received she would like to purchase fodder and cattle. She thanks MDO \"Arvand\" in advance for the help and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1563014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle and fodder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Asht","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.666667 70.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-06T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-06T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mujassarhon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":156.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":159.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":163.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":168.05},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":179.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":156.1,"local_amount":156.1,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":156.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694851},{"amount":159.99,"local_amount":159.99,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":159.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626641},{"amount":163.97,"local_amount":163.97,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":163.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209127},{"amount":168.05,"local_amount":168.05,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752107},{"amount":172.24,"local_amount":172.24,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":172.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624277367},{"amount":179.65,"local_amount":179.65,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":179.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636634799}],"funded_date":"2014-04-25T14:58:15Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":690810,"name":"\u00c1ngela Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1ngela es soltera y tiene dos hijos por los cuales tiene que velar para un sustento, desde hace varios meses inici\u00f3 su negocio de venta de comidas, (perros, hamburguesas, salchichas, etc).

suffering from severe migraines and wanted to import and distribute health\/wellness products into the marketplace, namely the old-fashioned Hot\/Cold Ice Bag. This product had been a tried and true remedy for minor ailments and it had helped so much in providing relief in a natural way. So she set out to design modern patterns and import the product into the U.S. to distribute to retail stores.\r\n\r\nWhat she loves the most is that she can get to be creative.  She created an idea that the consumer would find useful in their life. She also enjoys working with retail buyers and creating products that they want to see on their shelves.\r\n\r\nShe has over 20 years experience in the wholesale\/ retail and import\/export industries. She has also worked with national retailers such as Target, Whole Foods Market, The Container Store, and many more. The biggest challenges have been finding capital when the business is growing and keeping up with that growth. \r\n\r\nCourtney is seeking a Kiva loan to purchase inventory. She is also looking to sell her product to more retail stores. Her goal within the next 12 months is to offer additional Ice Bag patterns to capture a wider variety of retail clients. She is also working to enter Collegiate private label manufacturing, for example, UCLA Bruins themed Ice Bags.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2064.06,"image":{"id":1575995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":["Kiva

\u201cBigmista\u201d, and Phyllis, \u201cMrs. Mista\u201d. It started out as a way for Neil to raise money for barbecue competitions he started doing back in 2006. He would cook lunches that Phyllis would then deliver to places such as Kaiser, Wells Fargo and LACOE.\r\n\r\nThe idea to compete came from the great guys Neil met on the BBQ Brethren Forum. After posting, reading and finding community on the site, he decided he wanted a BBQ smoker. At the time, they lived in a two-bedroom apartment. As competitions produced awards, so came more requests for Neil\u2019s signature barbecue.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief period of unemployment, Phyllis decided it was time to dedicate her time into expanding their talents into a business.\r\n \r\nThey started vending at the Watts Certified Farmers\u2019 Market (CFM) on Saturdays in November 2008. With plans to grow slowly, they hit the road crawling. It never occurred to either of them that folks were getting ready for Thanksgiving and other holiday parties (who wants barbecue during the holiday season?). Sales were truly pitiful. \r\n\r\nBy February 2009, Phyllis had registered them into six farmers\u2019 markets that Neil couldn't do because he was still with Wells Fargo. She explained to him that it didn't make sense for them to pay people to do what Neil wanted to do. He tried to talk his boss into letting him work part-time (afraid to take the leap). He came home disappointed that his boss said no. He was soon all smiles when Phyllis told him to go ahead and quit. It scared both of them, but they were stepping out on faith and good food. \r\n\r\nEver since then, Neil and Phyllis have put all their time and efforts into making their business grow successfully. The Kiva loan will allow them to open a full-service restaurant that would help to increase activity in all service areas of the business. It would also allow the company to increase its capacity to increase farmers' market presence.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2659.14,"image":{"id":1573205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":["Kiva

She has been making batik at home in Java for over 23 years, \"while waiting each day for my father to come home from the sea. We still design together, especially the floral and bird motifs that are typical in Pekalongan batik. My husband Rieckey also helps me a lot, but as a woman, I'm very proud of the fact that I can have the career that I love, and to be able to provide for myself and my family.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I want to give a million thanks for your support and for trusting me with this incentive. This support will  help keep my venture growing by allowing me to offer work to batik artisans. I have received many requests for my products, but because my capital is not much, I cannot fulfill all of them. I need capital that would allow me to stock up on silk and batik materials to fulfill these orders. I am really counting on this interest-free microcredit to speed up our batik production. Our sales are increasing, but there are not enough of us to meet orders. We are making a great big effort to work at full capacity, but it is not enough if we do not get more people to help us or cannot buy more silk and new canting for new batik designs. To all of you who have offered your support, I would like to express my biggest thanks.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Yuni's silk batik items on the NOVICA site:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/5981\">http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/5981<\/a>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1290864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase silk, canting tools, and batik stamps","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Java","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2014-04-07T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-07T02:00:06Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2850,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":293.28,"local_amount":293.28,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T17:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":293.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490936722},{"amount":416.46,"local_amount":416.46,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T16:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":416.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504374485},{"amount":235.6,"local_amount":235.6,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T15:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":235.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517652005},{"amount":614.9,"local_amount":614.9,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T15:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":614.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530131069},{"amount":567.82,"local_amount":567.82,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":567.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542632941},{"amount":721.94,"local_amount":721.94,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T14:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":721.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561766869}],"funded_date":"2014-04-07T16:02:07Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T14:30:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iris Belen","image":697625}},{"id":693960,"name":"Xayyam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Xayyam is a married man and has a child.

Dipali is a housewife and her husband is an electrician in Dhupguri. Dipali received an education up to grade 9 and her husband has completed class X (grade 10). Dipali has three children and all of them are receiving a higher education. \r\n\r\nPrior to her husband's business, he was engaged in an electric shop where he learned how to repair electronic goods. Taking those experiences, he has opened his own shop where he sells different types of electrical goods such as switch boxes, electric wares, switches, bulbs and tube lights etc. and he repairs electronic goods. But, due to the competitive market, there are many of these shops nearby, so it becomes very difficult for him to sell the electric goods.

in Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri in their own kachha house (made of mud, wood and bamboo). Jhuma and her husband both have primary educations. One of their children is receiving an education and is in grade three and the other is below the school-going age.\r\n\r\nJhuma's husband Ganesh is engaged in the business of bamboo-made baskets.  He purchases bamboo from his locality and makes baskets with the help of his wife Jhuma.  Together they carry the baskets to the local markets and sell them. This product is in great demand because the local people belong to a poor section and are mostly cultivators.  They cannot expand their business because they need to purchase more bamboo, but are unable to do so due to a lack of money.\r\n\r\nSo, Jhuma has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase more bamboo. They want to make more baskets to satisfy their customers' demand.  This is the only source of income for the family, so they are trying their hardest to improve their business. This will help them to earn more profit to run the family well and meet all the basic needs of their children.\r\n\r\nJhuma wants to go ahead with this business in order to give a financial stability to the family.  She is, therefore, very much thankful to BJS and Kiva for granting her the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1578198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase bamboo to make baskets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-04-07T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-07T04:40:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-07T16:53:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":694007,"name":"Lucia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucia works hard to support her family.

She and her husband are illiterate and can only sign their names.  Her husband Jaminul, 45 years old, is a farmer. Their son is unemployed.\r\n\r\nChalema's husband is associated with an agribusiness. He grows different crops on his small plot of land.  He works hard to grow good quality products to sell in the local markets with the help of Chalema. As his income is modest and hardly enough to cover expenses, he can't generate a profit as expected and needed for the family. They thought of purchasing a cycle van (a vehicle for carrying goods and people in the rural areas) for additional income. He will carry harvest products to the market and carry people for extra income. \r\n\r\nChalema has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS, to purchase a cycle-van for her husband.

He is married and has 3 children who are 11, 6 and 7 months old.  Two children attend school. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, Musa established a business to sell provisions, drinks and electronics. He began his business because he completed school to the primary school level and did not have the opportunity to further his schooling. \r\n\r\nHe decided to go into the clothing business.  During his business activities, his shop was robbed and his inventory was stolen.  He went to his elder sister to seek help to re-establish another business.  He was helping his sister to own her business.  The commission he made was saved and later used to establish the drinks, provision and electrical appliances shop.  \r\n\r\nThe loan will help Musa a lot because he wants to buy more goods for his shop.
