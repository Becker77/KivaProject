For this reason, her business turns a big profit, because she's able to sell a lot during the week.\r\n\r\nTo increase her working capital and expand her business, she's been working with Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, for the past nine years. She's seeking her ninth personal loan, and the previous ones were repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to buy n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts to transform into sumbala and retail them for cash to a female clientele. In addition to her working capital, she counts on turning an average monthly profit of XOF 120'000, that she intends to use to repay the loan, provide for herself, and reinvest the remainder in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1578973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts to make sumbala","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-04-07T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-07T13:30:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.47,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nanou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490960990},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677338},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517676982},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209520},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658515},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561792824},{"amount":116.53,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.13,"payment_id":579757929},{"amount":110.36,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.3,"payment_id":595318633},{"amount":106.62,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-03T11:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":55865.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.04,"payment_id":610752426}],"funded_date":"2014-04-08T10:08:56Z","paid_date":"2015-03-03T11:21:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":694085,"name":"Nora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of two children, Nora works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fish-vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from buying and selling piglets.

She started her humble business by buying children's clothes in her area, but this business needs a lot of money in order to purchase more stylish clothes for the children and cosmetics and accessories. The money which she accumulates is not enough for that and most of what she earns goes on the expenses of her family. For this reason, she applied for a loan of 30,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase children's clothes and accessories. \r\n\r\nNaseem looks forward to expanding her business by buying more children's clothes.

She is using this loan to purchase building materials and pay for construction labor.\r\n\r\nRegina is committed to rebuilding her devastated life, and in the future would like to save enough money so she could afford to send her children to college.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":65.6,"image":{"id":1577279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

For the past many days, his rickshaw is not working properly because of regular uses. He feels that most of its parts are out of order, so he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. Therefore, Marry has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

She has worked for 20 years as a third-party seamstress. She has acquired a lot of experience in this area, and because of this, she dreams of having her own shop.

For the past many days his rickshaw has not been working properly because of regular use. He feels that most of its parts are out of order, and he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of new rickshaw. Therefore, Parveen has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

She has earned a living through her pot making business for several years now. She also runs a sari-sari (variety store) business selling various goods and items to the people in her area.\r\n\r\nDioscora needs a loan for the expansion of her business, but unfortunately she lacks the financial resources to do so. Due to these circumstances, she joined Community Economic Ventures, Inc.

Despu\u00e9s ella conoci\u00f3 a su hoy en d\u00eda esposo quien tambi\u00e9n es caficultor y trabaja en otras fincas con quien tiene 9 hijos, de los cuales 6 de ellos ya se casaron y la mayor\u00eda vive en otro municipio viviendo con ella solo tres: Mar\u00eda tiene 22 a\u00f1os y estudio hasta tercero de ciclo despu\u00e9s no quiso seguir estudiando y le ayuda en los oficios dom\u00e9sticos a su madre, Olman de 20 a\u00f1os no le gusto el estudio y prefiri\u00f3 aprender un oficio aprendiendo la ebanister\u00eda pero no termino ya que prefiri\u00f3 ayudar a sus padres en sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 y ayuda en otras fincas y la menor tiene 8 a\u00f1os y est\u00e1 en segundo grado en la escuela de la comunidad. Tambi\u00e9n con ella viven 5 nietos de distintos hijos, los cuales ella los cuida. Ella se dedica al cultivo de caf\u00e9 y aprendi\u00f3 a realizar todas las actividades concernientes a este rubro, por medio de una capacitaci\u00f3n que recibi\u00f3 en la escuela agr\u00edcola. Su propiedad es de 2 manzanas en la cual siembra granos b\u00e1sicos pero \u00fanicamente para el consumo del hogar. Anterior mente tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda un peque\u00f1o negocio de pulperia el cual cerro por la inestabilidad de precios sobre los productos que vend\u00eda por lo que mejor decidi\u00f3 dedicarse 100% al cultivo de caf\u00e9 ya que lo estaba descuidando por estar m\u00e1s pendiente de su pulperia. La tierra que cultiva la compro y est\u00e1n en el mismo terreno donde est\u00e1 construida su casa pero tambi\u00e9n tienen otras por herencia a su esposo de la madre la cual queda a una hora caminando y hasta en estos momentos la est\u00e1n arreglando ya que el caf\u00e9 est\u00e1 en plant\u00eda. A ella le ayudan sus hijos, nietos y esposo y a veces paga trabajadores, sobre todo la temporada de corta de caf\u00e9. \nDo\u00f1a Reina desea que por lo menos su hija menor siga estudiando y se grad\u00fae del colegio y si es posible en la universidad, as\u00ed llegar m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de donde ella y sus hijos mayores llegaron, tambi\u00e9n sue\u00f1a con ir ampliando m\u00e1s sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 y dejar un patrimonio fortalecido para su familia. Ella solicita financiamiento con el cual comprara con una parte fertilizantes, foliares y pagar la mano de obra para aplicar estos insumos a sus cultivos debido a que despu\u00e9s de la temporada de corta las plantas quedan un poco maltratadas y necesitan asistencia y un buen mantenimiento para que la planta de caf\u00e9 este fuerte y floree bien. Con la otra parte del financiamiento a las mismas personas pagar mano de obra para sembrar unas 2,500 plantas de caf\u00e9, que ya tiene listas en las zonas que est\u00e1n un poco despobladas en donde se a podado planta vieja o enferma o que no hab\u00eda caf\u00e9. \n","en":"Reina is 54 years old and studied up until third grade. She did not continue because the income level of her parents did not allow it. Later she met her now-husband, who is also a coffee grower and works on other farms. She has nine children with him, six of which are already married, most living in another town. Only three are living with her. Mar\u00eda is 22 years old and studied as far as ninth grade and did not want to continue. She helps her mother with the housework. Olman, 20 years old, did not like school and preferred to study the woodworking trade. He did not finish though, since he preferred to help his parents with the coffee crops and he helps on other farms as well. The youngest daughter is 8 years old and in second grade at the local school. Also living with Reina are 5 grandchildren that she cares for, from various children.\r\n\r\nReina works as a coffee farmer, having learned how to carry out all of the related tasks through training she received at the agriculture school. Her property consists of 2 manzanas where she plants basic grains but only for family consumption. Previously she also had a small convenience store business, which closed due to price instability of the products she sold. For this reason she decided it would be better to dedicate herself 100% to coffee farming since she had been neglecting it while looking after her convenience store. She purchased the land she farms and it is the same land where her house is built, but she also has other land through her husband's mother's inheritance that is an hour away on foot. Even right now it is being worked on since coffee is being planted. Her children, grandchildren and husband help her and sometimes she pays workers, especially during coffee picking season. \r\n\r\nReina hopes that at least her youngest daughter will continue to study, graduate from high school and if possible, go on to university so that she gets further than Reina and the older children. She also dreams of expanding her coffee farm and leaving a better inheritance for her family. She is requesting financing that she will use partly to buy fertilizers and pay for the labor to apply them to her crops, since after picking season the plants are left a little mistreated and need help and good care so the coffee plants are strong and flower well. With the remaining part of the loan she will pay the same people to plant 2,500 coffee plants that she already has ready in areas that are a little thin due to removal of plants that were old, sick or did not bear coffee.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1573406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies and pay for labor to help with her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-04-07T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-07T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.93,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T10:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595663663},{"amount":573.33,"local_amount":10750,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":11019.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762672},{"amount":171.41,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3331.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.93,"payment_id":624827082}],"funded_date":"2014-05-01T11:26:42Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:00:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Paulson","image":1289394}},{"id":694277,"name":"Mahroof","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mahroof is an active borrower of BRAC Pakistan.

She is married and has three children. She lives in a small country village. From childhood, Hanifa dreamed of becoming a teacher but circumstances happened such that she was unable to receive a higher education due to financial difficulties in her family. Right after she graduated from secondary school, Hanifa got married and became a homemaker. But even though she is always at home, she never sits idly.<br \/><br \/>In order to have a steady income to live on, Hanifa and her husband started their own business. They practice livestock breeding. Hanifa raises the cattle and then sells the meat and milk that they get from them. She receives a good income from this business. Hanifa's husband also helps her run this business. Their earns are enough for an average standard of living. Now they do not have enough money to cover all of their current needs. Currently, Hanifa and her husband want to buy several more heads of cattle to fatten up. This is why she requested a loan from Arvand to buy cattle. Hanifa thanks Arvand in advance for the support, which will help improve her family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1559529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-07T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-07T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hanifa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":771.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":795.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":819.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":845.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":871.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":896.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.02,"local_amount":771.5,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":785.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694853},{"amount":887.98,"local_amount":4228.5,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4306.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626643}],"funded_date":"2014-05-06T15:54:29Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:31:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":694303,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma is 39 years old and married, with two children.

Pardagul is a calm, kind and compassionate woman. She is married and is raising two children. Her eldest son works as a clothing salesman; her youngest son is 16 years old and attends school. Pardagul works as a janitor in a country school. As the salary is low, Pardagul grows vegetables and legumes at home. Pardagul wants her children to eat healthy food.

calzado sino el atuendo que identifica a cada una de sus regiones. Con el paso de los a\u00f1os, dentro de las regiones del Estado de M\u00e9xico comenz\u00f3 el fen\u00f3meno de la migraci\u00f3n en la cual habitantes de las comunidades comenzaron a salir a las grandes ciudades en busca de un empleo o bien una mejor calidad de vida. Es as\u00ed como la ropa de moda comenz\u00f3 a llegar a estas regiones, despu\u00e9s de ello se expandi\u00f3 el comercio y la oportunidad de vender ropa para varias familias.\n\nEduardo, Griselda y Evodio son algunas de esas personas que decidieron dedicarse a la venta de ropa; comentan que llevan 2 a\u00f1os desde que iniciaron con este tipo de negocio gracias a que sus familiares los motivaron a tener su propia actividad econ\u00f3mica. Eduardo  inici\u00f3 ofreciendo a sus clientes calcetines y ropa interior para dama y caballero gracias a que ha trabajado arduamente y con la ayuda de Griselda y Evodio han podido obtener un local cerca de su domicilio en donde, con mucho esfuerzo, dedicaci\u00f3n y amor a su negocio tambi\u00e9n pueden ofrecer a sus clientes pantalones para dama y caballero, blusas, camisas, chalecos, abrigos, playeras y sudaderas y tambi\u00e9n gracias a VisionFund M\u00e9xico ellos han podido ampliar su negocio y poder ofrecer sus productos no solo a sus vecinos. Adem\u00e1s ya tambi\u00e9n salen a los distintos tianguis fuera del Estado a vender la gran variedad de mercanc\u00eda que adquieren.\n\nCon el cr\u00e9dito solicitado, Eduardo comprar\u00e1 pantalones, blusas, camisas, sudaderas y chamarras ya que es lo que sus clientes le consumen y con ello \u00e9l podr\u00e1 contar con el dinero necesario para que sus hijos Mariel de 4 a\u00f1os y Eduardo de tan solo 2 meses de nacido puedan tener todo lo que necesitan. Asimismo Eduardo comenta que quiere ahorrar para que cuando su peque\u00f1a inicie con sus estudios no le falte nada y pueda comprar lo que le pidan en la escuela. Griselda y Evodio tambi\u00e9n invierten en su local de ropa y comprar\u00e1n la misma mercanc\u00eda que Eduardo ya que son socios en el negocio.\n\nEllos son las 3 personas que integran al grupo Familia Miranda quienes han sido beneficiadas con los apoyos que ofrece VisionFund M\u00e9xico. Ellos comentan que en el tiempo que han estado trabajando con la fundaci\u00f3n han visto un gran avance en su negocio y eso los ha impulsado a seguir adelante con la finalidad de ofrecer una mejor calidad de vida a sus familias y con sus ganancias ellos pueden ofrecer lo indispensable en su hogar. Por si fuera poco, su negocio les da la oportunidad  de cumplir con la empresa que haa cre\u00eddo en ellos y los ha apoyado para que su negocio sea fruct\u00edfero y en un futuro cada uno tenga un local propio pero no olvidando que con la ayuda de los 3 integrantes han podido salir adelante.\n","en":"Previously the majority of people in the villages did not wear shoes and wore the dress that identified each one of its regions. With the passage of time, the phenomenon of migration began in the regions of the State of Mexico, in which inhabitants of the communities began to go out to the big cities in search of a job or a better quality of life. This is how fashion clothing began to arrive in the regions. After that, another business expanded that gave several families the opportunity to start selling clothing.\n\nEduardo, Griselda, and Evodio are some of these people who decided to start selling clothing. They tell us that it has been 2 years since they started this type of business, thanks to their family members motivating them to create their own economic activities. Eduardo started by offering his customers socks and men\u2019s and women\u2019s underwear. Thanks to the fact that he has worked arduously, and with the help of Griselda and Evodio, they have been able to open a store near their house. With a lot of effort, dedication, and love for their business, they can now offer their customers men\u2019s and women\u2019s pants, tops, shirts, vests, overcoats, t-shirts, and sweaters. Also, thanks to VisionFund Mexico, they have been able to expand their business and are able to offer their products not just to their neighbors. They go out to different street markets outside of the state to sell a large variety of the merchandise they offer.\n\nWith the loan requested, Eduardo will buy pants, tops, shirts, sweaters, and jackets, since it is what his customers buy from him, and with it he will be able to have the money so that his children Mariel, 4 years old, and Eduardo, only 2 months old, will have everything they need. Eduardo also notes that he wants to save so that his little girl can start school, not lack anything, and be able to buy everything the school requests of them. Griselda and Evodio also invest in their clothing store and will buy the same items as Eduardo, since they are partners in the business.\n\nThey are the 3 people who make up the Familia Miranda (Miranda Family) group and have benefited from the support that VisionFund M\u00e9xico offers. In the time they have been working with the foundation, they have seen great progress in their business, and this has pushed them to move forward with the goal of offering their family members a better quality of life. With their earnings, they can offer the essentials at home, and their business also gives them the opportunity to fulfill their obligations to the organization that has believed in them and has supported them so that their business would be fruitful and so that in the future each one would have their own store, but not forgetting that with the help of the 3 members they have been able to move forward.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1568035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy pants, tops, shirts, sweaters, and jackets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Guarda San Antonio Buenavista, San Jos\u00e9 del Rinc\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-04-08T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-08T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evodio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5160.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5510},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5725.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6085.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6350.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6687.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":7065.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":7415.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":397.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":424.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":489},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":514.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":544.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":570.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":397.33,"local_amount":5160.12,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5171.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479290206},{"amount":424.27,"local_amount":5510,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490986610},{"amount":440.95,"local_amount":5726.58,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5739.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504427541},{"amount":468.65,"local_amount":6086.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6100.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517705226},{"amount":489.05,"local_amount":6351.25,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6365.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530255666},{"amount":1629.75,"local_amount":21165.72,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":21213.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542690484}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T22:56:15Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T18:41:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":693157,"name":"Marilu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilu is Nicaraguan, 48 years old, and has six children.

She specializes in the preparation of pastries and sandwiches for all occasions.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifteen years, she has been dedicated to her work and to the development of her business.

He is married and currently has one child. Fatulloh lives with his wife in a small house in a country village. In order to feed his family, he runs his own business.<br \/><br \/>Fatulloh practices farming and livestock breeding. He has a plot of land. From the main plot of land, several portions are left as unwatered land while the rest of the plot is irrigated land. On this land Fatulloh grows carrots, potatoes and grains.

She is very energetic, hard working and enthusiastic and always devotes her time to get her family ahead.\r\n \r\nBrundabati has been selling milk and doing a seasonal business with her husband for 10 years to maintain her family. Initially, she started the business in a low profile with a limited investment and purchased a cow. Gradually, she expanded her business and added one cow every year from her savings.   \r\n\r\nIn 2014, Brundabati, along with 15 other members of her village, formed a group named Maa Tarini and took a loan of Rs 16,000 each from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their businesses. This is the first loan for her group. Now she is earning 7,000 INR per month from her business, which is very scanty to manage her big family. To add some extra income, her husband is doing some seasonal business in his village. So from this loan, she has purchased a cow (for selling milk) and some seasonal items, thereby increasing her income. Brundabati has a long cherished desire to build a permanent house for her family and educate her child in a better school in a nearby town. The other 15 members of her group are running a milk business, a vegetable business, grocery shops, hotels, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1578974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a cow and some seasonal items like mahul and paddy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Jaljad, Tarbha, Balangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-04-08T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-08T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":4300,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahalya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bijili","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brundabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brundabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kasturi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nirupama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pankajini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raseswaree","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ratan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":256000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":4300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":256000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-02T09:20:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":694340,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a widowed woman with five children (four adults and one in school).

She is very energetic, hard working and enthusiastic and always devotes her time to get her family ahead. \r\n\r\nRupakanti has been doing a milk business with her husband in her village for the last five years to maintain her family. Initially she started the business with a low profile and limited investment and purchased a cow. Gradually, she expanded her business and added one cow every year. In 2014, Rupakanti along with 11 other members of her village formed a group and took a loan of Rs 16,000 each from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their businesses. This is the first loan for her group. Now she is earning 5,000 INR per month from her business, which is very scant to manage her big family. To add some extra income, her husband is doing some seasonal business in his village. With this loan, she has purchased a cow for selling of milk, thereby increasing her income. Rupakanti has a long cherished desire to build a permanent house for her family. \r\n \r\nThe other 11 members of her group are doing a milk business, goat rearing, hotel, grocery shop, tailoring, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1578992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a cow for selling milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Thakpali, Tarbha, Balangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-04-08T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-08T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aruna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basumati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Budari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dileswari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyosna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rupakanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subidha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Supan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":192000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":192000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-15T01:46:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":694352,"name":"Phanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phanuel is a 54-year-old married man.

She is very energetic, hard working and enthusiastic and always devotes her time to getting her family ahead. \r\n\r\nPuspa has been doing a milk business with her husband in her village for the last 10 years to maintain her family. Initially, she started the business with a low profile and limited investment and purchased a cow. Gradually, she expanded her business and added one cow every year. In 2014, Puspa, along with 11 other members of her village, formed a group and took a loan of Rs 16,000 each from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their businesses. This is the first loan for her group. Now she is earning 7,000 INR per month from her business, which is very scanty to manage her big family. To add some extra income, her husband is doing some seasonal business in his village. So from this loan, she has purchased a cow to sell milk, thereby increasing her income. Puspa has a long cherished desire to build a stall of her own and educate her children in a better school.\r\n \r\nOther members of her group are doing a milk business, vegetable vending, goat rearing, grocery shop etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1579033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchased a cow for selling milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Mangalapali, Tarbha, Subarnapur, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-04-08T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-08T05:10:03Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhagyabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gouri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhalajhali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khairadini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Narmada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parbati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phulatuli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudebi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sungyani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":192000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":192000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-09T00:01:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":694377,"name":"Riffat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riffat is a 44-year-old woman who lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her four children.

She is a mother of four children. Her husband is a leather merchant, he has been doing his business for past ten years. He is alone responsible for providing for the entire household. \r\n\r\nBabiy's husband wants to purchase leather in bulk for reselling purposes. But due to some financial constraints he is unable to buy leather to re-process it and for reselling purposes. Therefore Babiy has applied for a Kiva loan from BRAC Pakistan so that she can financially assist her husband to buy leather for his business purposes. This loan amount will also be helpful for him to increase the size of his business. \r\n\r\nBabiy is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. \r\n\r\nTherefore Kousar has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw.

She has become an expert in her art and wants to buy raw material of her own so she can sell her handmade embroidery in her hometown.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Zahida has requested a loan to buy raw material so she can knit more embroidered dresses to sell and generate maximum income. \r\n\r\nShe is a mother of three daughters and a son.

is a 23-year-old businesswoman living in Mbire District, Zimbabwe. She is very passionate about protecting the environment so she volunteers at local clinics and organizes cleaning campaigns. Additionally, she offers psycho-social support to young people in her community. As an entrepreneur, Dadirai rents a table at the local flea market where she sells products such as bags, shoes, jeans, shirts, skirts, track suits, and T-shirts.

She gets her supplies from local wholesalers and sells her products to a customer base made up of men and women, for cash and often on credit.\r\n\r\nShe expects to make an average monthly profit of 45,000FCFA, which will be used partly for health-related expenses, food, clothing and school fees, with the rest to be reinvested in her business.

He is a single man and lives with his family in Taiz city, Yemen. Due to the bad conditions in the country, Fouad studied until the secondary school, but unfortunately, he couldn't complete his studies. He is very active and dynamic man. Despite his miserable conditions, Fouad didn't surrender to them. \r\n\r\nOver time, he accumulated a good amount of money and then he began his own business, opening a store to sell products for the home in the city. He started up in his business for more than four years ago. From this business, he earns a good profit, but he says that his capital is still small and the goods inside the store decrease daily. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Fouad applied for a loan of 300,000 YER from Al-Amal Microfinance Bank in order to purchase more materials and goods to increase the capital of the store.\r\n\r\nFouad looks forward to expanding his business through opening other branches.

","en":"Diloramhan is 67 years old, a widow, and has five children. After the death of her husband, Diloramhan was unable to get over the loss of her loved one for a very long time. Needing to raise her children and get them on their feet, Diloramhan decided to take her household and financial responsibilities into her own hands. She has been raising cattle for more than 30 years. She started this business with 50,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work and commitment, she currently receives a monthly income of 18,000 som (KGS). Diloramhan has 5 milk cows on her farm.
