His parents' lack of economic resources meant that he was unable to continue studying, and he had to work from a young age. However, over time, the scarcity of work in the place where he lived forced him to seek better opportunities to move forwards. This is how he arrived at the tropical town of Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nHe began working as a labourer harvesting rice, plantain, pineapple and other local produce. 20 years ago he bought his own agricultural plot. Today, he is 49 years old and single, and lives alone making a living with his crops. The place where he lives doesn't have any basic necessary services, because it is a long way away from the town of Ivirgarzama.

She has three children; her oldest son is self-sufficient and works and lives separately. Bubatma has a secondary education. Her neighbors have a good opinion of her as a kind and hardworking woman. For the main source of income for her family, Bubatma has been growing crops, fattening up cows for the past 20 years, as well as selling food products. She started this business with initial start-up capital in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bubatma's hard work, she has been able to develop and expand her business. This business brings in a steady income of about 20,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves to cover the food expenses and everyday needs of her family.  For the purpose of further developing her business, Bubatma turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows as well as to buy wholesale merchandise with the rest of the money for subsequent retail sale. Bubatma plans to invest the earnings from the loan to further increase her business.

His parents taught him to do this when he was young as he had no other productive activity.  Today he is thankful to his parents as he does this work for himself. He has no other work than in agriculture. He has always worked as day labor. The place where he works is 25 minutes from his house and he gets there by walking. He works with his brothers to get the maximum quantity of plants and make their work more profitable.<br \/><br \/>Santos needs a loan to buy fertilizer for his crops as it is cheaper now. He will also buy machetes, pay the rent on the land he farms and pay for labor to prepare the land.

They travel around different markets with different household items, clothes, shoes and farm inputs. Their target market is households with low income that have to shop in open air markets where items are cheaper. The group that comprises 18 members has been saving with VEP for the last  two years and has developed a very credible reputation with discipline. They have a vision of opening up a distribution stall where they can employ other youths to assist in sales around the local markets which open different days of the week. With this in mind, they would also like to add solar lamps to their stock as one of the products that can help those at the bottom of the pyramid without access to electricity.\nEsther,the group treasurer (pictured at the far right) was the first one to buy a solar lamp from VEP during a roadshow to their region. After experiencing the changes in her fuel budget and the quality of light, she promoted the lamp to a friend in the market who agreed to form a group and get the lamps on credit for their homes.Esther says since she bought the lamp, she has saved a lot of money previously used to buy kerosene and for mobile charging. Her children also started enjoying longer study hour which has led to improved grades. Esther and the group would like to see other families enjoy clean, convenient lighting while at the same time making money from the sale of those lamps\nThey have purchased different types of solar lamps from VEP on credit and with their sale, are confident the group will repay the loan from the profits and even take a second loan to expand the business\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5775,"image":{"id":1575853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

As part of this goal, Lifa is a hairdresser and owns a salon. She has many female customers as she charges a low price for her service in order to earn a better profit. She also offers body treatments and services. \r\n\r\nAs she has done this for many years, she is now in need of new equipment and some renovations including the repair of the water system. If she can get this addressed now, she will be ready for the upcoming wedding and celebration season which is her busiest time of year. \r\n\r\nLifa estimates that these improvements will cost her 500 EUR and is confident that the loan will improve her business even more.

She needs a Kiva loan to expand her business, send her two children to school and be able to care for her other dependants. Her business currently needs capital to boost her purchases and if she gets the loan, she will make bulk purchases of sugar, drinks, cooking oil, rice, flour, washing and bathing soap, milk powder and margarine. Judith is also a part-time student and the profits from the business will enable her to pay for her school fees. When she is not at her business, she serves as a Cama District Chairperson and the Vice-Chairperson of the Cama Zimbabwe National committee. Cama is Camfed\u2019s alumnae network of women leaders and entrepreneurs.

They work and help her with the household expenses. She is known for being an honest, hard-working and above all enterprising woman. \r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, she managed to set up a small shop in her home and thanks to God and her hard work and dedication the business is very well known in the area, which is why she has a large customer base. \r\n\r\nFor Sonia, is is very important to keep this business going because it is her main source of income. This is why she has decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in buying merchandise for the shop such as eggs, sweets, sugar, rice, milk, beans, sweet bread, propane gas and other items which may attract customers. In this way, she hopes to achieve her dream of keeping her business open and consequently, continue working towards a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1573591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy eggs, sweets, sugar, rice, milk, beans, sweet bread, propane gas and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-04-08T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-08T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":46.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":46.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":51.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":59.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":61.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":64.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":67.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":71.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.47,"local_amount":93.47,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-19T09:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":93.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491254433},{"amount":49.01,"local_amount":49.01,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":49.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504170047},{"amount":51.37,"local_amount":51.37,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":51.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519529483},{"amount":60.22,"local_amount":60.22,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":60.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530494334},{"amount":55.89,"local_amount":55.89,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-19T09:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":55.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":543042924},{"amount":62.94,"local_amount":62.94,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":62.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562331650},{"amount":327.1,"local_amount":327.1,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":327.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579476870}],"funded_date":"2014-05-07T13:42:12Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:34:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":691022,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Monica se considera una chica humilde, sencilla y bastante sacrificada.

He always helps his mother around the house with pleasure. Zhumabu has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding. She started this business a few years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zhumabu's hard work, she currently has 3 milk cows and 30 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 150,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Zhumabu turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She plans to buy sheep to fatten up and then sell at the market for a high price. Zhumabu plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also is determined to save money for her son's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1578642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kolduk village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-08T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-08T22:30:05Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":52.85,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhumabu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":283.34,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":15438.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440568},{"amount":266.15,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15438.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.18,"payment_id":636161061},{"amount":247.66,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":15438.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":35.67,"payment_id":730933271}],"funded_date":"2014-05-05T21:57:54Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:56:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":694743,"name":"Clara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clara is 42 years old, married, and has three children who are in school.

Kaliypa has a secondary education. She currently fattens up cattle and practices crop farming. Investing an initial 30,000 som (KGS) in her business, she increased her herd to include 4 sheep and 1 cow. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). In the winter, her livestock are located on her farm; in the summer, they will be brought out to pasture.

","en":"Zuhra is 45 years old, she is married and together with her husband raises three children and also runs their farm.  Zuhra has a high school education and right now she is a homemaker.  As a main source of income for her family Zuhra farms, she started 18 years ago with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Determination and hard work allowed Zuhra to achieve visible results; today her holdings include a 3,00 HA plot of land, where she grows potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, cabbage and tomatoes every year and sells them to local residents.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further grow her holdings, Zuhra turned to Bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan to purchase potato seeds.  Zuhra plans to use the loan profits to invest into further growing her business and plans to save funds for a quality education for her children.

different backgrounds and cultures. She is pictured with her mother. \r\n\r\nShe lives in Khonghampat, which is 14 kms away from the heart of Imphal city, Manipur, in northeastern India. Sonia is the second child of her parents. She has one elder brother who is a cultivator by profession. Her younger brother is still studying in pre-secondary school. Sonia was raised in an inter-marriage family. Her father belongs to the Meitei community, which is considered in Manipur as the privileged group. Her mother is from the minor tribes of Manipur. Being raised in a cross-cultural family, Sonia could incorporate different aspects of culture, tradition, religion into her daily life. \r\n\r\nMeeting new people and being exposed to new ways of thinking isn't a challenge for this confident young woman. Her father is a primary teacher and her mother, a homemaker. With only the income of her father they manage all the household expenses. \r\n\r\nSince her parents could no longer support her studies, she went to the capital state and looked for a job in the hospitality industry to self-support for education. Sonia says she worked very hard to pursue her education and career at the same time. \r\n\r\nAir hostess has always been a dream career for her. Luckily, when the interview was conducted in Imphal, she was selected as one of the successful candidates. It was a perk for her as she had experience in the hospitality industry to get the cabin crew job easily, says Sonia. However, just clearing the interview wasn't the complete process. She was worried about the big amount of money to be paid to the airlines for the security deposit to enroll her for the training. All the challenges did not deter her from achieving her goals. As she sought help from her family and friends, fortunately one of her uncles suggested that WSDS gives education loans to those who need financial assistance. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will pay for her refundable deposit, invest in helping others who need financial assistance like her and support her parents. She is so grateful to WSDS for helping her to fly high and fulfill her aspirations. She says confidently that her parents would be so proud of her and she hopes to do much better in the future.

She is the eldest daughter with three other siblings and her father is a retired army man. Her mother is a homemaker and is engaged in taking care of the family.  Lhingjoycy is pictured with her mother and excited to share her experiences while pursuing her career.\r\n\r\nLhingjoycy started working at an early age as a saleslady in a departmental shop in the capital of the country. It takes three days and two nights to travel by train to reach the capital. She completed her pre-secondary and did not continue her degree, but instead began earning and sharing her father's financial burden. Managing the family's financial affairs with the meagre monthly pension of her father usually leaves her parents in despair as her father is the sole bread winner and her other siblings are still in school.\r\n\r\nLhingjoycy spent two years in sales and but could hardly manage for herself with high rent and other expenses in the capital town of New Delhi. Left with very few options for jobs, as a good-salaried job requires a higher degree and job experience, she continued her retailing job and took care of herself and was still hunting for a better opportunity. \r\n\r\nRecently after a job trial at various openings, Lhingjoycy got selected for cabin crew for a domestic airline in India. She is overwhelmed for the job and insecure because one pays the refundable training fees. Tension was high with nowhere to access a loan or ask from relatives and the payment date was approaching. If one fails to pay on the stipulated date, then there is no mercy. Her neighbouring friend who is a cabin crew recruit for another airline and also accessed a loan from WSDS had a suggestion, after Lhingjoycy shared her financial insecurity about the refundable deposit. She consulted her parents and her mother insisted for the loan so that she can support the family while she earns as a flight attendant.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will pay for the training fees and will join the aviation industry, make a salary and support her siblings in their studies and also take care of her parents.\r\n\r\nLhingjoycy's gratitude is immense and she will always remain obliged for the wonderful generosity accorded her in shaping her career. The pathway that Kiva and WSDS creates for her is unconditional and sincere. She says, \u201cthank you so much, Kiva.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1575662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for her training course fee as a cabin crew\/flight attendant ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-04-09T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-09T08:10:01Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingjoycy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-13T19:30:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":694593,"name":"Vicky","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 32 ans, Vicky vit dans une famille polygame avec ses 03 enfants dans le quartier CASSABLANCA.

years old and married. She has seven children, one of whom is still in school. To make a living, Roen has been working as a rice farmer who grows rice on almost 2 hectare of farmland. To supplement the income, she also works as a paid worker in the local area.

She started this business in 1996 with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Baiyzkan's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 3 horses and 10 sheep on her farm, as well as a 2.8 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans. Her agricultural business brings in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of beans, which mainly serves to cover the family's food expenses and daily needs. The earnings from her business allow Baiyzkan to raise and provide for her children. For the purpose of further developing her business, Baiyzkan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy mineral fertilizers and bean seeds.

However, all of her children are completely grown-up and live on their own, which is why only her husband is involved in her business. He helps till the land. Ryskul has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practices crop farming and livestock breeding. She started this business in 1999 with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ryskul's hard work, she currently has 3 milk cows, 2 calves and 1 horse on her farm. She also has a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans. Her monthly income is about 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Ryskul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy bull calves to fatten up and then sell at the market for a high price. With the remaining money she will buy fertilizer, seeds and fuel products for cultivating her land. Ryskul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She is also determined to save money to build a barn for housing her cattle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1578770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bull calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bakaiyr","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-09T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-09T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":39.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ryskul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":35417.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489010},{"amount":610.58,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":35417.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":39.42,"payment_id":636161064}],"funded_date":"2014-05-09T09:45:02Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":691117,"name":"Dora Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elizabeth, es una mujer de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera, trabajadora y alegre, tiene dos hijos de 18 y 4 a\u00f1os de edad.

","en":"Muminahan is 41 and married with three children. Her oldest daughter is married and the younger children are in school. Muminahan has a high school education and is a hard-working, honest and purposeful woman who works in agriculture and animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 25 years ago with 2,000 KGS. Now she has one milking cow and 0.3 hectares of arable land, on which she grows crops, with a monthly income of about 10,000 KGS.

Mehrinisso decided to invest her skills and knowledge  in a new business in the sphere of livestock breeding. She has a cow shed and cattle feed. Some time ago, Mehrinisso raised cattle, but when her daughters got married, she sold all of her cattle in order throw their weddings and buy their dowries. Mehrinisso decided to restart her business and regain a source of income. Please help Mehrinisso fulfill her goal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1578872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy cattle to restart her business and regain a source of income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qurgan-Tube","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-04-09T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-09T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mehrinisso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490883303},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504310348},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517592163},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530087804},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542568970},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561700964},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579637588},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595214206},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610609610},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:47:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624881679},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636348065}],"funded_date":"2014-04-22T15:14:02Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:36:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":691211,"name":"Villa Del Sol Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Villa del sol es un grupo formado en la ciudad de Asunci\u00f3n, es un grupo que est\u00e1 trabajando por luchar y mejorar sus condiciones de vida.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

She is 41 years old. She is married and is raising two children. Her husband receives a small salary. This salary is not enough to provide the family with all of the necessities. Gulchehra decided to help her husband for the benefit of their family. She started her own business of sewing women's clothing four months ago. She wants to develop her new business.

Initially, she started the business in a low profile with a limited investment. Gradually, she expanded her business and added some new items every year.   \r\n\r\nIn the year 2014, Pramila, along with another twelve members of her village, formed a group and took a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their businesses. This is the first loan of her group. \r\n\r\nNow she is earning 6,000 INR per month from her business, which is very scanty to manage her family. From this loan, she purchased sugar, salt, oil, rice, wheat, shampoo, tea, coffee, groundnuts, pickles, mixture, biscuits, soap, potatoes, onions, garlic, dried chilies, turmeric and other spices, and other grocery items. \r\n\r\nPramila has a long-cherished desire to build a house of her own in her locality. \r\n\r\nThe other members of her group are doing a milk business, vegetable vending, cloth store, paddy business, goat rearing, etc."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1579769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchased sugar, salt, oil, rice, wheat, shampoo, tea, coffee, groundnuts, pickles, mixture, biscuits and soap.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Ambgaon, M.Rampur, Kalahandi, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-04-09T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-09T21:40:04Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tribeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandhyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sashmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santipriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amulya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saraswati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sapur","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":156000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":156000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-09T15:32:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":694912,"name":"Irshad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irshad is a 39-years old woman, living with her five sons, a daughter and spouse in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been doing a job in a firm on very low wages.

","en":"Olga is a retired person. Her received pension is simply not enough to live on. This is why Olga must sell vegetables at the market as a hired employee of one of the market employers. Not long ago, Olga broke her leg and had an operation which is why she was disabled for some time. Olga hopes that she will get back to normal soon and be able to once again go earn money at the market. Olga has been raising her granddaughter like her own daughter for the last six years. The girl's mother, her daughter-in-law, abandoned the family and her daughter, leaving the child with Olga. Olga really looks after the child and wants to provide her with a home and raise her while she still has the strength. <br \/><br \/>Olga and her husband live in their own home not far from the nature reserve \"Narcissus Field\" in Khoost. Some things in the house have already been repaired previously, specifically the windows and doors have been replaced, plumbing has been brought into the house and a porch has been constructed. Now Olga wants to re-plaster the house, for which she needs 10,000 hryvnia

He is an educated man and has a diploma certificate. Due to hard conditions in the country, Wasem couldn't find a job. He was still unemployed for a long time, but he didn't give up on his goal. Fortunately, he had a good amount of money and decided to invest it in a business. \r\n\r\nHe has opened a grocery in the house that he has been renting for more than three years. Recently, his business is going very well, and he wants to expand it through purchasing more goods and foodstuffs for the grocery. Unfortunately, most of what he earns goes to the family's expenses, and because of the debts, the capital decreases daily. For this reason, he applied for a loan of 150,000 YER from AMB. He will use the loan to purchase more goods for the grocery.\r\n\r\nWasem looks forward to expanding his grocery and being able to get married in the future.
