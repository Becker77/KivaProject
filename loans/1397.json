Every end of the month, Johana receives approximately an adequate amount from her fishing business operations.\r\n\r\nJohana joined GDMPC last year to have an easy access to financial services. She borrowed a loan from GDMPC in addition to her capital.

He is married, and his wife helps him in his work.  He has eight children.  Five children live with him in his house.  Two of them work, two are students, and one of them isn\u2019t studying.  He helps him to sow and care for his small farm.  Five children depend on him.\r\n\r\nHe works in agriculture and farming.  He has about ten years doing this type of work; he learned it from his brother.  It is about two kilometers from his house.  His wife and his children help him, because he is already an older man and it is hard for him to work a lot.  He knows that he should do it to take care of his family.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy chickens, feed, and vaccinations for them, as well as manure and pesticides for his crops.  It's necessary that he uses it, in order to plant and to buy more chicks.  In this way he will be able to improve his farm and can, at the same time, always work in farming.  He always needs to buy treatments for his wife.  \r\n\r\nHis dreams are to be able to have a large farm and to be able to give his children a better quality of life.  He also dreams that his wife would always have her medicine, because she suffers from her heart and needs to have her treatments from month to month."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1574250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy chickens, feed, and vaccinations for them, as well as manure and pesticides for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-10T03:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-10T03:00:11Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":325,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537735}],"funded_date":"2014-04-22T19:02:47Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:23:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":695072,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":338.28,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase more plastic slippers to resell.

She was unable to go to high school because her parents could not afford it then.  She is the eldest of four siblings and had to work as a domestic employee to help her parents cover the household expenses.  She is single and has no children and lives with her elderly parents.  She works hard to support them since they cannot work like they used to.\r\n\r\nShe has been domestic employee for 15 years in order to help pay for the family's education and food, because of the lack of economic resources in the household.  She walks 1.5 km from home, up hill, and leaves in the morning at 5:15 a.m. to be at work at 6:00 a.m.  In order to leave on time she must get up earlier and do the housework beforehand.  She also works in agriculture helping her father and a cousin.  Her work schedule is from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy wood worth $540, which will be the infrastrructure for the roof of the house she and her family are building.  She will buy tiles worth $360 to finish the construction.  It will be a little cheaper for her to make the purchase at one time as she can transport both things together.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to form her own family, have children and set an example for them just like her parents did for her.  She wants them to get the education she could not receive because her parents could not afford it.  She wants to finish her house before winter so they will have shelter from the storms in their new home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1574292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He attended school until 6th grade and could not complete his education for financial reasons. He began to work the land with his father since, due to a lack of economic resources, he had to work and bring in income for his family.\r\n\r\nHe is currently married and lives with his wife, who performs household duties and runs a small store that the family decided to open to earn some extra money. They have three children, one who is 13 and in 7th grade, one who is 11 and in 5th grade, and one who is 9 and in 2nd grade. A total of four people depend on Jose.\r\n\r\nJose has made a living by selling fruits and vegetables for the past 5 years. He began while working in a market helping a friend but, when he had enough experience to start his own business, he started working for himself. He feels that he has earned a good income from this. He also works in agriculture, since he only sells fruit and vegetables four days per week. On the other days and in the winter, he tends to the crops. In the summer, he sells the fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, Jose will make improvements to his home by repairing the floor. He will purchase sand, cement, iron, and wire, and pay a bricklayer. His floor is currently earth, and he would like to install a cement floor to improve the health standards for his family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to purchase a larger house and grow his business.

The women live in large traditional families in Tagan, in the sub-prefecture of Kangare (Sikasso Region, Republic of Mali). They have been working in small business for several years and are very sought after in their business of buying and selling clothing, including wax pagnes (colorful print fabrics) and bundles of second-hand clothing. In order to meet the growing needs of their clientele, the members of the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program one year ago. They are on their second group loan. Denible expects to use her loan to purchase 10 units of wax pagne and one bundle of second-hand clothing. She stocks up in Bamako and locally from wholesalers, and sells her products in Selingue at retail for cash and for credit to a mixed clientele. She hopes to make a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA, a sum which will allow her to repay the loan and reinvest in her clothes-selling

procrearon 4 hijos de los cuales ya todos formalizaron sus familias; actualmente ella vive con dos nietas ya que la madre de ellas est\u00e1 en otro pa\u00eds al igual que el esposo de Mar\u00eda. Ellos con el deseo de salir adelante arriesgaron sus vidas para tener una mejor fuente de ingresos y dejando a su familia atr\u00e1s para superarse econ\u00f3micamente.\n\nMar\u00eda se dedica a la agricultura desde su ni\u00f1ez, ya que no pudiendo estudiar ella junto a sus hermanos trabajaba junto a sus padres cultivando los granos b\u00e1sicos, tambi\u00e9n ella los \u00faltimos 10 a\u00f1os de su vida se ha dedicado al cuido de ganado, con esto ha podido tener una fuente de ingresos extra ya que con la venta de los animales y el producto de ellos ha podido ir saliendo adelante con los gastos de su hogar.\n\nElla solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la agricultura pagara mano de obra, comprara pesticidas y abonos para sus cultivos y tambi\u00e9n comprara un cerdo el cual lo cuidara y tendr\u00e1 en crecimiento para luego venderlo y as\u00ed tener un ingreso a mediano plazo con dicha venta. Con la compra de todos los insumos ella ahorrara, ya que ahorita el precio est\u00e1 m\u00e1s barato que cuando ya la temporada de siembra aumenta el precio de los productos es m\u00e1s alto. \n\nEn un futuro Mar\u00eda desea tener una gran producci\u00f3n de granos b\u00e1sicos y que todos los esfuerzos que ella ha realizado hasta ahorita le sean recompensados, desea que sus hijos sean tan felices como ella lo ha sido con sus familias y adem\u00e1s ella desea poder tener las fuerzas para seguir trabajando muy duro.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda, 61, never had a chance to go to school or learn to read and write because her parents couldn't afford the fees.  She and her husband have 4 children, all grown now with families of their own.  She lives with two grandchildren because their mother, like Mar\u00eda's husband, is working in another country.  They chose to leave their families behind and work abroad because that was their best option for getting ahead and better supporting their families.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has a farming business.  She and her brothers and sisters grew up on a farm, working alongside their parents to grow the crops that kept the family.  Mar\u00eda also raises cattle, work that she's been doing for the last 10 years or so.  The cattle and the products they produce cover her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is applying for a loan that she will use to pay expenses--labor and supplies--for her next crop and buy a pig.  She will raise the pig and sell it, an investment that will provide her with an income in the medium term.  Buying the supplies she needs now, when the prices are relatively low, will help her as well.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda hopes that her next harvest will be a good one and that she will see a good result for all her hard work.  She also hopes that her children will be as happy with their families as she has been with hers.  Finally, she wants the strength to keep working hard.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1574322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

This is why she is applying for a loan to buy the items listed and thus obtain better earnings to give her son what is needed without any limitation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1574356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" to buy beans, meat, rice, chicken, vegetables, etc. wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-04-10T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-10T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maida Ester  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":39.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":39.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":44.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":47.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":52.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":58.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":61.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.44,"local_amount":78.44,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-19T09:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":78.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491254451},{"amount":47.01,"local_amount":47.01,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":47.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504170064},{"amount":43.54,"local_amount":43.54,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":43.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519529500},{"amount":46.4,"local_amount":46.4,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":46.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530494351},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":46.2,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-19T09:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":46.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":543042940},{"amount":50.87,"local_amount":50.87,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562331660},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":53.33,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":53.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579476882},{"amount":234.21,"local_amount":234.21,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":234.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595083128}],"funded_date":"2014-05-09T20:10:34Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:05:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":691552,"name":"Mar\u00eda Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, no tuvo la oportunidad de estudiar debido al nivel de pobreza que hab\u00eda a nivel familiar y la distancia en que estaba la escuela.

As a farmer he faces challenges with cleaning. He presently holds an outside employment that gives him limited time to properly manage his cacao farm. He also cultivates different types of cash crops such as corn, beans and rice.   \r\n\r\nVictoriano is requesting the loan to hire workers to assist him in cleaning his cacao trees, as it\u2019s now time for harvesting corn. With his employment elsewhere his time is limited.\r\n\r\nHis future goal is one day to focus mainly on farming, and expand much on cacao as a permanent crop, and also educate his four children to a level where they could help themselves.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":354.23,"image":{"id":1580290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

For Flor, it is very important to keep her business active as it is her primary source of income.  \r\n\r\nFor this reason, she has decided to request this loan from INTEGRAL to purchase merchandise for her store such as eggs, candy, sugar, rice, milk, beans, sweet bread, and other items that will be attractive to her customers.  This way, she hopes to reach her dreams of keeping her business active and continuing to work for a better future.

They work hard each day to improve their lives and for this reason, the ladies are requesting loans from Kiva investors. Their ultimate goal is to sustain and grow their small businesses, providing them with enough income to eliminate poverty in their lives and to move forward.\r\n\r\nThis Trust Bank has gradually grown and appreciates the monthly meetings with a Loan Officer from Friendship Bridge. During these meetings, the women not only make payments on their loans, but also participate in non-formal educational trainings on relevant subjects like health and nutrition, effective business practices and indebtedness, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, as well as self-esteem.\r\n\r\nBecause of these loans and the non-formal education trainings, women who are clients of Friendship Bridge can empower themselves and begin to move out of poverty. Manuela is an excellent example of someone who has planned wisely and used her loans successfully. She is the 35-year-old Secretary of the Trust Bank and is married with two sons. Manuela is the owner of a restaurant in the center of her town, Santa Clara La Laguna. She hopes to take out a new and higher loan because in the summertime, she has more clientele in her restaurant. She plans to buy indispensable items like firewood to cook on, rice, noodles, juices, soft drinks, and other necessary products. With the knowledge that she has gained during the monthly trainings during the non-formal educational sessions, the loans and her eight years of experience, Manuela and her family are enjoying a higher quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cEsperanza\u201d Trust Bank has high hopes of continuing to improve their lives and is most appreciative to each Kiva investor for funding their loans. The ladies are committed to using the funds wisely and repaying their loans on time. They face a brighter tomorrow as empowered women eliminating poverty. Thank you Kiva investors!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4975,"image":{"id":1578054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Guatemala. It is renowned for the production of high quality textiles and also serves as the commercial hub of the entire region. The Friday market, possibly the biggest in Central America, is quite popular and traders from all corners of Guatemala come here, many arriving the night before with some starting to sell by candlelight before dawn. \r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cFranciquenses\u201d, meaning \u201cpeople from San Francisco\u201d, is located here and made up of ten women who range in age from 23 to 64 years. They all have a common goal, which is to improve not only their own lives, but those of their families. \r\n\r\nAndrea is a 28-year-old member of the Trust Bank. She has had six years of formal education. She is a hard-working mother of three sons who she describes as \u201cher reason for living\u201d. Her ultimate goal is to offer them a better future and she works arduously day-by-day to make this a reality. Andrea, like 80% of the women in her Trust Bank, invests her loan in the purchase of thread and cloth so that she can create pants, jackets, sweatshirts and sweatpants, as well as other articles of clothing. Her father and her sister also assist Andrea in her work, with the expectation that there will be increased clientele with increased inventory. Everyone in the family will bene\ufb01t.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cFranciquenses\u201d, thanks KIVA investors for providing them with the capital in the form of their loans. The ladies want to share that they will work hard to take advantage of this valuable opportunity to move ahead and improve their lives. They look forward to sharing their stories with KIVA investors in the future.

This is a cold area and well-known for the production of warm jackets, ponchos and blankets. Many of the town\u2019s population are also engaged in animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cVista Hermosa\u201d, meaning \u201cBeautiful View\u201d, is located in this area and has already completed two loan cycles with the organization. For this new loan cycle there are 10 women, and 4 are new members. Martina is one of these new members. She is 34 years of age and has requested a loan to increase her sale of delicious prepared food items, especially during the popular Easter week celebrations. She would like to purchase new kitchen utensils, pots and pans of various sizes, and pitchers for drinks. Martina travels to two nearby markets to sell her delicious foods.\r\n\r\nMartina\u2019s dream is to move ahead in her life and be able to meet the basic needs of her four children. Especially important to her is the education of her little ones, because Martina realizes that education is the key to a more prosperous future.

The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cAsunci\u00f3n\u201d, is located here. The Trust Bank consists of 14 women who are mostly indigenous. They wear traditional \u201ctraje\u201d, which usually consists of a blouse called a \u201chuipil\u201d, a skirt called a \u201ccorte\u201d, and a belt called a \u201cfaja\u201d. These colorful items mostly are handmade, sometimes with the use of a simple backstrap loom, and then painstakingly embroidered with designs, symbols and stories that date back to antiquity. They identify the region that the wearer originates from.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank are eager to begin their new loan cycle. The President of \u201cAsuncion\u201d is Feliciana, who is a 55-year-old widow. She has three children, and is committed to help them in every way possible. Feliciana employs three women and works in textile production. She specializes in \u201cikat\u201d, which is the dyeing of patterns by means of binding threads or cotton yarn called \u201clabores\u201d that are then colored with brilliant dyes. This technique is called \u201cjaspeado\u201d in Guatemala, and each village has its own unique, beautiful designs. \r\n\r\nFeliciana is requesting a new loan which she will use to purchase a large quantity of thread and yarn as well as supplies to dye it with. This hard-working woman travels each week to deliver her orders, and usually delivers 50-60 bundles of thread (with 25 units in each bundle). She manages her money wisely and there is a good cash flow.\r\n\r\nA Friendship Bridge Loan Officer visits the Trust Bank on a monthly basis. Besides making payments on their loans, the Loan Officer gives educational training on useful and relevant subjects like nutrition and health, effective business practices and indebtedness, as well as women\u2019s rights and self-esteem. Other topics include hygiene and nutrition.\r\n\r\nKiva investors are greatly valued and appreciated by the women of the Trust Bank. The loans that the 14 ladies are requesting will be used in their businesses to increase their income and grow their businesses. In this way, they will be able to improve their quality of life and that of their families. It will also be useful for them to take advantage of future business opportunities by having funds available. \r\n\r\nFeliciana, along with her partners, are most grateful to those in KIVA who are helping them make their dreams come true. They are committed to repaying their loans promptly and completely. They face a brighter tomorrow, armed with their small loans and newly acquired knowledge. Thank you Kiva investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6400,"image":{"id":1580412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To

The group brings together women who know one another through parentage and neighborly ties. They are 26 years old on average. Married with an average of two children, they run different businesses, such as the buying and selling of grains, as Ada, who is the only one seated in the photo, does. They live in large traditional families in the Wahabiaking neighborhood of Ouelessebougou, in the Kati prefecture (Koulikoro region, Republic of Mali). They have been in small business for several years and are very sought after in their business of buying and selling grains, including millet, corn and rice. In order to meet the growing needs of their clientele, the members of the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago. They are on their fourth group loan.

She runs a falafel restaurant, which she has been doing since 1995. Falafel, known in some foreign regions as a vegetarian burger, is a deep-fried ball made from ground chickpeas and fava beans.

Her goal is to be able to send her children to school to have a career and have their own home. But first, she needs to confront her biggest obstacle: limited resources. She is currently asking for a loan with Kiva and she will use it to purchase a refrigerator, an air conditioner and sound equipment with the goal of attracting more costumers to her store and little by little make her dream of prosperity a reality. \r\n\r\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1574413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase a refrigerator, an air conditioner and sound equipment.

The monthly incom is 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulnora turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan to purchase a dairy cow. For the remaining money she would like to purchase mineral fertilizers, pesticides and cotton seeds. Gulnora plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock, and plans to save money for renovating her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1579095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a dairy cow, as well as mineral fertilizers, pesticides and cotton seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochubaev village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-10T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-10T20:30:06Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25201.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440574},{"amount":434.46,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25201.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.04,"payment_id":636161070}],"funded_date":"2014-04-21T14:26:11Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":695053,"name":"Iyut","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iyut runs a small stall where he sells groceries and mobile phone airtime credits.

Sima is full of energy, splitting her time between her work and her studies at university. She is lucky to have the support of her family, who are very proud of her achievements, watching her attentively to see what endeavors she will take on in the future.\r\n\r\nSima is the managing partner of a beauty salon that she owns in partnership with her brother. A salon is one of the few types of socially acceptable businesses for females to own and operate in her community, and one of several in Sima\u2019s town. Despite the restrictions and competition, Sima\u2019s eagerness and assertiveness has quickly made her salon one of the most famous beauty salons in her town.\r\n\r\nThough she is young, she takes her business seriously, as it is the main source of income for her family, and most importantly, the only source of income to cover her tuition and expenses at the university. In addition to providing for her and her family, her business provides employment to five individuals, four of whom are women. \r\n\r\nEventually, Sima hopes to have a chain of beauty salons that extend beyond her own community. Until then, she continues to expand her salon. As a growing business with high potential, Sima has qualified for a WLIFT loan in the amount of 20,000. With these funds, Sima plans to expand her salon\u2019s space and services to include anti-aging treatments and massage therapy. She predicts that this expansion will allow her to reach 5-10% more customers, increasing her income and stability. \r\n\r\nAs a participant in the WLIFT program, Sima is participating in the modular business training offered by the program and will also participate in one-on-one coaching as well as be connected to a business mentor.  An entrepreneur who is under the age of 30, Sima also qualifies for the youth loan category on the Kiva platform.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":20000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":20000,"image":{"id":1580196,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2951,"youtubeId":"jvvtfeqifz0","title":"Kiva

Since he is a more experienced welder, Sabin voluntarily mentors some of AEC's younger welders, helping them make strategic decisions and grow their own welding businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7375,"image":{"id":1573722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Growing Businesses"],"use":"To purchase a fabrication machine so that he can make all of the inputs for his construction projects in house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Musanze","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":319,"posted_date":"2014-04-10T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-10T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":7375,"lender_count":248,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":7353,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":7375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":919.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":919.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":919.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":919.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":919.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":919.13},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":919.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":919.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":921.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":921.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":921.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":921.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":921.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":921.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":921.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":921.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1843.76,"local_amount":1838.26,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1843.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530486196},{"amount":921.88,"local_amount":919.13,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-27T10:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":921.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561557771},{"amount":921.88,"local_amount":919.13,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":921.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581553814},{"amount":921.88,"local_amount":919.13,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-26T10:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":921.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":597094007},{"amount":921.88,"local_amount":919.13,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-04T10:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":921.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610476152},{"amount":501.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-23T09:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":501.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624150735},{"amount":173.74,"local_amount":173.22,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":173.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636137419},{"amount":418.25,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-20T12:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":418.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650184071},{"amount":750.23,"local_amount":748,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-06T12:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":750.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681270844}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T01:53:35Z","paid_date":"2015-08-06T12:10:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":692500,"name":"Coop Isabane 2014B Gp4 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustin is married with three children.

She works as a housekeeper to make sure that her beloved children will get the best education, which will be their best weapon for a brighter future. She is devoted to her children and misses them a lot. She hopes that one day they will unite back together forever. But, in the meantime, her main goal is to provide them with the best education. Her low income isn't enough to cover both her living needs in Lebanon and her family\u2019s increasing needs back at home, in the Philippines. As a result her acquired loan will be sent to her children to pay for their increasing educational fees.\r\n \r\nRosalina is the beautiful lady in the center of the picture.

He is not always successful in selling his entire harvest after he gathers it so then he must lower the price of his goods, which puts a strain on his resources. But Alexander does not give up - he works hard and invests all of his strength and finances into his business. Not long ago, thanks to an increase in his income and received profits, he was able to also purchase a Mercedes minibus for his business. <br \/><br \/>He needs 15,000 hryvnia (UAH) to buy potato seedlings for planting. As it is currently right in the middle of the season for planting potatoes, he wants to seize the opportunity and buy more potatoes. This will then bring him a more bountiful harvest and more

Mamlakat does not want to lag behind her fellow villagers and wants to establish a new business in the sphere of livestock breeding. She wants to buy several heads of cattle in order to start her business. Mamlakat loves animals and lives to look after them.

He is married and has 5 children, all of school-going age.  He has been involved in farming for the past 15 years, where like most farmers in Kisii, his main source of income is milk, tea, bananas, and cereals.  He enjoys farming because he is able to get quick and fast money through selling his products locally.  His biggest challenge is climatic or seasonal changes, and lack of capital.\r\n\r\nPeter chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer affordable interest rates on their loans.  During the training, he learned how to manage his small income.

They thought that only by learning a trade could he get ahead.  Feliciano has a partner who has a business selling tortillas, with which she contributes to the household.

An uncle taught him to farm, because his father died when he was a child.  Because of this, he had to start working very hard at a young age.  He also buys cattle, which he sells at the end of the year.  His two oldest children help him with this work.\r\n\r\nFeliciano will use the money from this loan to rent some land where he can work this year.

She hopes to increase her income from her business so as to improve her standard of living better than before."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1577307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Ponhea Krek district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-04-11T02:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-11T02:40:07Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Poeun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khoeurn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":84000},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1076000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T21:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":84000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479284095},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490980619},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":84000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504421696},{"amount":21,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517699197},{"amount":166,"local_amount":664000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":664000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530249913},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1000000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636488251}],"funded_date":"2014-04-27T19:56:08Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:29:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":695541,"name":"Savon's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Savon is a villager from the Ponhea Krek district of Kampong Cham province.

The place where he works is 3 kilometers from his home and he walks there, or sometimes goes on his bicycle. Jos\u00e9 hires a cart in order to transport his agricultural produce to his home. He works for six hours every day.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan he is requesting to buy a team of oxen to transport his produce to his home. This will be very useful to him as it will make his work easier and he will no longer have to pay to hire a cart to take the products to his home.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to improve his crop, increase his yield and sell his produce in the community in which he lives.

El grupo est\u00e1 integrado por seis mujeres muy trabajadoras y emprendedoras por eso mismo cada uno de ellas tiene una actividad econ\u00f3mica y necesitan de un cr\u00e9dito para invertir en sus negocios. Rosa y Ma Guadalupe invertir\u00e1n en borregos y pollos; Guillermina y Marcelina, en pollos y pavos; Mayte, en vacas y Guadalupe en pollos.\n\nLas integrantes eligieron el nombre del grupo porque donde realizaron sus primeras solicitudes y reuniones de cr\u00e9dito, hab\u00eda un \u00e1rbol de capul\u00edn enorme, y el nombre del \u00e1rbol en su lengua materna, el mazahua, es \"Reense\".\n\nGuadalupe o Do\u00f1a Lupita, como le dicen de cari\u00f1o, est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Margarito desde hace ya varios a\u00f1os juntos han formado una familia con dos ni\u00f1os los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando.

Lo importante de los pollos es cuidarlos mucho del fr\u00edo y alimentarlos muy bien. Do\u00f1a Lupita est\u00e1 muy contenta y agradecida con su negocio porque podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s pollos y pastura para los caballos que tambi\u00e9n tiene en casa. Acerca de los caballos, son los que utiliza para trabajar en las milpas, ya sea para sembrar o levantar la tierra de los sembrad\u00edos de ma\u00edz. Lupita dice que antes le daban miedo sus caballos porque los consideraba agresivos, pero con el tiempo los ha tratado y ahora los considera parte de su familia. La \u00fanica dificultad de Do\u00f1a Lupita es cuando sus pollos enferman y mueren para ella es una gran p\u00e9rdida de inversi\u00f3n, pero esto no la ha desanimado nunca pues quiere continuar ayudando con los gastos de la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos; porque para ella es muy importante que sus peque\u00f1os puedan terminar una carrera profesional para mejorar su calidad de vida.","en":"The Grupo Del Reense (Flat) group is located in a Mazahua community where their mother tongue, their traditions and their clothing are still preserved. It is notable for its trees that are so high they shade the residents' houses. The group is made up of six women who are very hardworking and enterprising. That is why each of them has a financial activity and they need a loan to invest in their businesses.  Rosa and Ma Guadalupe will invest in sheep and chickens.  Guillermina and Marcelina will invest in chickens and turkeys. Mayte will invest in cows and Guadalupe in chickens.\r\n\r\nThe members picked their name of the group when they made their first applications and credit meetings. There was an enormous wild cherry tree and the name of the tree in the mother tongue, Mazahua, is \"Reense\".\r\n\r\nGuadalupe, or Do\u00f1a Lupita, as she is affectionately called, has been married to Margarito for several years and together they have made a family with two children who are in school. Five years ago, she decided to help with the household expenses and the children's education  by raising and fattening up chickens. \u201cI buy them when they are small and for six months I raise them and fatten them and afterwards, I sell them to my neighbors when they need to make food for their families.\u201d The important thing with the chickens is to be very careful with the cold and feed them very well. Lupita is very happy and grateful with her business because she can buy more chickens and fodder for the horses that she also has at her home. The horses she uses to work in the fields, whether for planting or for tilling the soil of the corn crops. Lupita says that before she was afraid of her horses because she thought they were aggressive, but over time, she has gotten to know them and now she considers them to be part of the family. Do\u00f1a Lupita's only difficulty is when her chickens get sick and die because for her that is a big loss of investment. But this has never discouraged her because she wants to keep helping with the education expenses for her children. For her it is very important that her little ones to get college degrees so they can improve their quality of life.

Now, she makes her sales in cash from 6:30 until 2:00 in the afternoon every day. Her goal further on is to have her own store, although her greatest challenge is increasing her income to aspire to the national government\u2019s housing subsidy. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for a Kiva loan, the second loan requested from the Mario Santo Domingo foundation, by means of which she will purchase provisions like rice, oil, flours, and other nonperishable supplies in order for the inventory to exist. With the previous loan from this organization, she was able to increase her business, offering much more effective service and thus gather funds to purchase her home since currently she rents.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1574505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
