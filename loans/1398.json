Her dream is to have a restaurant with better facilities and to meet her family commitments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1574589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy buy vegetables, rice, beans, oil, meat, sausages, pasta, condiments, and drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2014-04-11T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-11T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":28.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":28.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":32.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":34.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":35.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.64,"local_amount":53.64,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-18T09:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":53.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490938778},{"amount":28.77,"local_amount":28.77,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T16:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":28.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504376412},{"amount":27.83,"local_amount":27.83,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T15:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":27.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517653796},{"amount":189.76,"local_amount":189.76,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T15:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":189.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530142339}],"funded_date":"2014-04-21T07:37:00Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T15:51:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Fried","image":null}},{"id":695774,"name":"Lucio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucio, age 28, is a certified organic cacao farmer of MMC.

Murotkul earns a good income from his business and spends it for meeting his family needs. But now he wants to expand his business, specifically the potato-growing business.  And now he does not have enough of his own money to purchase seeds for planting potatoes.  This is why Murotkul came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy seeds for sowing.  He hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1561459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy potato seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-11T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-11T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Murotkul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":243},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":247.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":252.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":256.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":243,"local_amount":243,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":243,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302904},{"amount":757,"local_amount":757,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":757,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585702}],"funded_date":"2014-04-15T03:20:45Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":695887,"name":"Liza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liza is 60 years old, married, and has six children.

","en":"From the time she was very small, a girl named Yenni dreamed of being a nurse. In her childhood, she was leaving school to go home, but when she got to the street, she came upon an accident. She approached and realized that the person who had been injured was her sister. She reacted, did everything she could to save her, and managed to stabilize her while the ambulance arrived. Ever since then, she knew that she had what it took to be a nurse. Time passed; she went to live with her aunts in Bogot\u00e1, as she had been living outside of the city. There, she went to work as a server in a restaurant. In her free time, she searched for options for studying nursing, since that was her passion.\r\n\r\nSoon after, she visited various institutions to gather information. Out of all those that she visited and learned about, the one that appealed to her most was Campo Alto. She approached the institution and, a few days later, she enrolled in a morning program to become a nursing assistant.   \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is in her second semester. When she gets out, she heads to work. There, she works part-time and then goes home to do her schoolwork and to help her aunt. \r\n\r\nShe wants to stay in school, but she feels that her financial resources are insufficient. She sees that her dream might not come true for her, but she will do everything within her reach to keep studying. \r\n\r\nThen, she found out about the arrangement with Kiva. It seemed like a big help to her; as she said before, she feels at times that the costs are really increasing, and she doesn't want to quit school. With this arrangement, she can graduate and put into practice all her knowledge and help others."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1574629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is married and has two children.  She lives in a small rural village.  Circumstances occurred so that she could not obtain a higher education due to her family's financial needs.  Zaropat was married off right after she finished a secondary school.  And so she became a housewife, but even though she is always at home, she never sits without anything to do. \r\n\r\nTo have a consistent income for food, Zaropat and her husband started their own business.  They are involved in animal husbandry.  She raises livestock and then sells meat and milk.  Zaropat earns a good income from this business.  Their income is sufficient to live at the middle class level.  And they still do not have enough means to cover all of the existing needs.  At the present time, Zaropat and her husband want to buy several heads of livestock for fattening up.  This is why she came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock.  Zaropat thanks Arvand in advance for the support, due to which her family quality of life will improve.\r\n    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":1564607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-11T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-11T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaropat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":96.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":103.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.21,"local_amount":96.83,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":116.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585704},{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":203.17,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":244.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081288}],"funded_date":"2014-04-11T20:22:43Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:22:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":695897,"name":"Narcisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Narcisa works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has an ambulant vending vegetable and spices business in the Philippines and also earns additional income from raising livestock and a general store.

He grew up with his parents who made a living slaughtering pigs. Francisco helped with farm work and slaughtering in the mornings with his parents, and spent the afternoons studying at a school in his community. He studied until 6th grade, and discontinued his studies because he acquired knowledge and experience and as such decided to pursue the purchase and sale of pigs. He is one of the older siblings who worked in agriculture to provide sustenance for the family.\r\n\r\nFrancisco works in agriculture as well as in the purchase of pigs, which he buys and fattens. Sometimes he buys them from the market on Friday, to then sell to workers at the butcher\u2019s shop. He learned this from a friend who also taught him how to plant corn: that part of the crop is for eating and the other part is for feeding animals. He has to travel many miles to buy pigs, as he goes door to door or purchases them on town market days.\r\n\r\nThe money will be used to buy pigs, since he has a space prepared in the house to feed and raise the animals until they are ready to be sold. This will in turn provide him with a better income, which he will invest in improving his home, as he hopes to build a room for his grandson.\r\n\r\nFrancisco\u2019s plans for the future are to have a larger space, enabling him to raise more pigs.

values that have made her a very well-known woman where she lives.  She devotes herself to the household chores.  On the week-ends she makes bread and \u2018pupusas\u2019 [thick corn tortillas that are stuffed with cheese, beans and\/or pork and cooked on a griddle] to sell.  She sells tortillas daily.\r\n\r\nMarcela grew up with her parents, and she lives with them.  They are very humble and hard-working people who also sell tortillas, bread, and pupusas.  There are three siblings in her family, and she is the youngest.  It falls to her to help with the household chores and with the sales in the family business.  Her two other siblings are independent and live far from their parents.  That is the reason that it was hard for her to complete her education, which she had partially completed.  She only went to school through the ninth grade.  \r\n\r\nAs time passed, and when she was old enough, she met the man who is now her husband.  He devotes himself to agriculture and digging wells.  They have a three year old daughter, and they live in Marcela\u2019s parents\u2019 house.\r\n\r\nThis young woman devotes herself to the household chores, and she has ten years of experience.  She learned this activity from her parents.  On the week-ends she sells bread and pupusas.  The other days of the week she sells tortillas.  She has been doing this for over five years, and she will continue to do so.  This is because it has become her main source of income to meet the basic needs of her household and to be able to cover her mother\u2019s medication expenses.  Her mother suffers from renal insufficiency, and she is receiving treatment.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money to buy medication used for treatment for her mother.  The date of her medical check-up and medication purchase is approaching.  This way, her mother\u2019s health and quick recuperation will be assured.\r\n\r\nThis young woman\u2019s dreams and goals for the future are to have finished repaying the loan and to make a new request in order to set up food sales on Mondays through Fridays.  She will do this with her mother\u2019s help.  \r\n\r\nShe has faith that her health condition will improve.  The mother will support the daughter until she completes her university studies.  She states that her daughter wants to become a nurse.  She will achieve all of this with the help of the loan and the investment of their earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1574649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for her mother's medical treatment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-11T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-11T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela Yasmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":17.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":17.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":18.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":19.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":19.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":20.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":21.16},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":22.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":23.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.24},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.74,"local_amount":16.74,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216580},{"amount":19.17,"local_amount":19.17,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":19.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817976},{"amount":19.05,"local_amount":19.05,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":19.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243337},{"amount":20.12,"local_amount":20.12,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":20.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526454},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":20.84,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":20.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008883},{"amount":42.58,"local_amount":42.58,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":42.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419734},{"amount":22.26,"local_amount":22.26,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":22.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544559},{"amount":23.25,"local_amount":23.25,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":23.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595144949},{"amount":23.74,"local_amount":23.74,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":23.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768596},{"amount":42.25,"local_amount":42.25,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":42.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200176}],"funded_date":"2014-04-12T01:26:36Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:59:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":695919,"name":"Clarita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clarita is a 61-year-old, married mother of one adult, and presently residing in La Union, La Libertad.

He met the person with whom he decided to have a relationship, and they now have two children who attend elementary school.\r\n\r\nWilber has 15 years of experience with agricultural work and transportation.  He learned this business activity from his father from whom he inherited the minibus.  He currently continues working with it.  He is motivated by the earnings and by the commitment that he has to give the best to his family.  On the days that there is no work with the minibus, he works on the corn and bean crops.  They serve to bring home the daily bread to his family.  The days that he works more providing service are Saturdays and Sundays.  On those days he transports people to different cantons and neighborhoods and people who are going to shop at the market.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money to repair the transmission in the minibus.  Lately there has been a good demand for his services.  With the repairs and adjustments that he will make to the minibus, he will be able to provide better service to his customers.  That will generate more earnings that will later be invested in paying for the basic necessities of his household.\r\n\r\nThe plans that he has for the future are to repay the loan and to get a greater amount to buy a new vehicle for transportation.  The one that he currently has is presenting some problems because it is old.  He will also support his children\u2019s education until they become successful professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1574653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to repair the transmission in the minibus.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-11T23:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-11T23:10:09Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilber Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":49.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":695930,"name":"Channa's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Channa is a rural villager from Kampong Cham province and she is 38 years old.

She lives in a tiny country village. She lives with her husband and children in a small house. She is a very good homemaker - cleanliness and beauty always reign in her house. She does everything she can for her family so that they live comfortably and do not want for anything.<br \/><br \/>Makhsuda has partnered with Arvand for several years already. She first took out a loan for consumer goods. Now she is also requesting a loan for consumer goods. Currently, Makhsuda and her husband are renovating their home where they live so that their children and grandchildren can live comfortably there. Makhsuda works as a seamstress from home.

He is married and has three children. He turned to Arvand for the first time when he realized that there was the opportunity to receive financial support. Erkinjon lives with his family in the countryside. He does not have a higher education, as he did not have the opportunity to study at university due to financial difficulties in his family. Erkinjon's wife also does not have an education. She is a homemaker who does the household chores and raises their children. <br \/><br \/>In order to have an income to live on, Erkinjon has his own business. He fattens up and sells cattle.

Currently, there is an increased cost when her son is at apprenticeship; it causes more difficulties for her family. Therefore, she is looking to borrow amount of money to pay for his education fees. She will try to do breeding and cultivation to have money to pay for loan on time.\nChung is the group leader of Chung\u2019s Group.

Then Uguloy got married and became a homemaker. But even though she is always at home, she never sits idly. She and her husband try to do all that they can to provide their children with all of the necessities.<br \/><br \/>In order to have a steady income to live on, Uguloy and her husband started their own business. They practice livestock breeding. They receive a good income from this business. Uguloy's husband also earns extra money as a local foreman. His work brings in additional income to the family. Their joint income is enough for an average standard of living. Now they do not have enough money to cover all of their current needs. Currently, Uguloy and her husband want to buy several more heads of cattle to fatten up. This is why she requested a loan from Arvand to buy cattle.

children. She lives in a village very from the city. She is married. In order to support their family, her husband left to work abroad in Russia. Mahlio does not sit waiting around for her husband to send home money to live on, but actively strives to improve her children's lives and raise the average earnings of her family. She works diligently so that her children can grow up comfortably and receive an education. Of course, she, like many mothers, has the dream that her children will grow up educated. After all, she only has a secondary education.<br \/><br \/>Mahlio raises cattle. She makes dairy products at home.

He is a positive young man who loves his family and children. He has elderly parents who he is very attentive to. Dilshod and his wife are raising three children. His children attend school. Dilshod himself has a secondary education. Dilshod practices livestock breeding. He inherited this business from his father. He raises cattle for slaughter. His wife helps him, but she spends the majority of her time at home raising their children.  In order to provide for his large family, he works diligently, but the income from livestock breeding is only enough for food and small household expenses. His children are growing up and a lot of money goes toward their education. The majority of Dilshod's time is spent running his business. He wants to buy another calf to develop his business. But he currently does not have enough money, which is why he decided to take out a loan.  He really hopes that Kiva will help him accomplish his plans.

Right after she graduated from secondary school, Salomat got married and became a homemaker. She and her husband try to do all that they can to provide their children with all of the necessities. <br \/><br \/>Salomat has partnered with Arvand for more than three years. In order to have a steady income to live on, Salomat and her husband started their own business. They practice livestock breeding. Salomat raises the cattle and then sells the meat and milk that she gets from them. She receives a good income from this business. The earnings are enough for an average standard of living. Now they do not have enough money to cover all of their current needs. Currently, Salomat and her husband want to buy several more heads of cattle to fatten up. This is why she requested a loan from Arvand to buy cattle.

She lives with her parents. She helps her parents raise cattle, milk the cows and process the milk. She has a secondary education. However, Farangis wants to become independent which is why she wants to buy small livestock so that in the future, she can save money to open her own independent business. Of course, she dreams of getting an education. She strives to save money to take correspondence courses and become a financially successful independent woman in the future; a woman who is able to self-sufficiently solve her own problems and help those that need assistance. Of course, these are just her dreams but they are enough to carry her through the beginnings of her business.<br \/><br \/>Farangis does not have enough money to implement her goals. Farangis's acquaintances advised her to turn to Arvand. The requested amount is enough for her to buy cattle and start her own business, thus turning over a new page in her life. Farangis is glad that there are such organizations like Kiva that support first-time entrepreneurs. She thanks you in advance for your help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1574834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-12T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-12T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farangis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":229.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":237.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":245.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":253.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":262.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":270.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":280.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":289.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":299.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":309.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":323.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.77,"local_amount":229.3,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":230.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875686},{"amount":49.39,"local_amount":237.07,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":238.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302911},{"amount":51.06,"local_amount":245.11,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":246.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585710},{"amount":52.8,"local_amount":253.42,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-18T10:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":254.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081294},{"amount":54.59,"local_amount":262.01,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":263.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562172},{"amount":56.43,"local_amount":270.89,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":272.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694862},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":280.08,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":281.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626651},{"amount":59.8,"local_amount":289.57,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":290.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.53,"payment_id":595209136},{"amount":61.29,"local_amount":299.39,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":300.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.08,"payment_id":610752115},{"amount":61.87,"local_amount":309.54,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":310.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.62,"payment_id":624277372},{"amount":59.27,"local_amount":323.62,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.15,"payment_id":636634803}],"funded_date":"2014-04-24T15:58:26Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":695956,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca works hard to support her family.

livestock. His parents are retired and help their son with his business. Ilhom is not yet married, but he has plans to start a family this year. His parents want him to marry a nice girl so she can take care of them and help his mother around the house. But Ilhom wants to save up for a wedding and expand his business so that in the future he can provide for his family and provide his parents with a happy retirement too.\r\n\r\nTo earn regular income, Ilhom and his father resell cattle. At the moment they don't have enough money to cover all of their costs. For this reason he consulted with his parents and turned to Arvand in order to receive a loan to increase the number of livestock he has. Ilhom and his parents are thankful to Arvand for giving them the possibility of receiving a loan so that Ilhom won't have to ask his family and friends, since in their region this is neither appropriate nor acceptable. He is very thankful to receive the necessary sum so that he can develop the business with his father."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1575402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

mother of four children. Currently, two of her children are in school and the two remaining are too young for schooling. She feeds her entire family via her rice, corn and cassava plantation, as it is her main source of income. She works at a paid working job to earn additional income. She has been in this business for 10 years and it has returned her a decent income. This is the seventh-cycle loan for her with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

husband runs a general store, from which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap, biscuits etc. He manages his household necessities from his own store as well, and some of his relatives like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with an impressive tone and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built very good relationships with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town, and that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relationships, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Suriya requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits etc. \r\n\r\nSuriya hopes that her husband will use the loan in a positive way, and that this amount will help him to cope with the demand.

varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education, and in their personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n \r\nShe would like to apply for another loan of PHP 20,000 PHP to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to expand her business more and dreams to give her children a good life and education.

He is very hard-working and responsible and has good moral and spiritual principles. He is well-known in the community for his work, and for his friendliness and charisma. He is characterised as a good person, with a good up-bringing and known for helping others. Miguel lives with his wife, who looks after the home, and one daughter and two grandchildren. Miguel works in farming - he grows basic grains such as corn, beans and sorghum. Miguel grew up with his father and grandparents and completed up to ninth grade at school. He did not finish school as it was 30 kilometres from from his house and at the time there was no transport to get there. Over time, Miguel has gained experience and knowledge about farming and this work has become his main source of income.\r\n\r\nMiguel has been working in farming since he was a young boy. He learned the trade from his father and grandfather, who instilled good principles and values in him. This work has led Miguel to becoming very well-known and respected in the community. Miguel has spent 35 years old working in farming and it has become his main source of income as he sells almost 50% of his harvests, while he keeps the rest for his family. Miguel's workplace is three kilometres from his house and one of his sons also helps him from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to start to prepare Miguel's land. With the farming season soon to start, Miguel needs to rent a new plot of land as he is going to begin growing watermelons. By doing this he can diversify his work, giving him a greater income on selling the harvests. He can then use this income to improve his home.\r\n\r\nMiguel's goals include: expanding his plots of land and diversifying his crops; and with regards to his children and grandchildren, he wants to support them in everything necessary for the education and Miguel tells us that one of his grandchildren wants to become a vet. Miguel can achieve these dreams by investing his profits in a new loan. He has a lot of experience with loans for farming."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1574659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to begin to prepare the land in order to start growing watermelons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-12T12:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-12T12:30:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":198.81,"local_amount":198.81,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":198.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200177},{"amount":201.19,"local_amount":201.19,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":201.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537738}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T03:00:56Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:23:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":691741,"name":"Mar\u00eda Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 58 a\u00f1os de edad, solo estudio segundo grado y la raz\u00f3n principal por la que no pudo seguir estudiando fue que la escuela le quedaba muy lejos de sus casa y tambi\u00e9n que sus padres no ten\u00edan  los suficientes recursos para ayudarle, ella es madre soltera, tiene nueve hijos de los cuales solo tres viven con ella y dependen econ\u00f3micamente de ella de sus hijos solamente uno estudio hasta primer a\u00f1o de bachillerato, ella se dedica a la agricultura  desde muy joven le ense\u00f1o a trabajar la agricultura, el lugar de su trabajo le queda cerca de sus casa ya que viven en el terreno donde realiza sus actividades, el cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para realizar un trabajo pendiente como lo es la recolecci\u00f3n de le\u00f1a  y otros arreglos en la propiedad, con lo cual generara algunos ingresos extras, para el sostenimiento de su familia, con lo de sus sue\u00f1os ella quiere que sus hijas tengan su propia casa para que vivan tranquilos, tambi\u00e9n que trabajen que tengan un trabajo que le beneficie fuertemente en su familia.

runs a general store and sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap biscuits etc. He manages the household and speaks with a monotonous tone which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of others. \r\n\r\nDue to his behavior and tone he has very good relations with customers.  His general store is very famous in town and he runs the store well and sales have increased, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand.  Therefore, Sajida requests a loan for her husband to buy wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits etc. \r\n\r\nSajida thanks to Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan.

It is made up of five women from Hodeidah, Yemen. They are hardworking and enterprising women. They took a loan of 130,000 YER from AMB. \r\n\r\nHasin is the group's leader. She is 27 years old and married.  One of Hasin's goals is to continue to grow her business. Since she has professional experience in this field, she has attracted more customers. She started in her business to help her husband cover their family's expenses. Since she earned a good amount of money, she decided to continue. She started selling Sambusa (a traditional food) five years ago.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 10,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nYolanda dreams of having a supermarket someday and hopes to have a good health.

She has seven children and lives in a traditional household in the Massablacoura area of the city of Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nShe has run a business selling clothing for over ten years. Her experience in this area has earned her a good reputation, and she receives orders for clothing. Thus, to have the necessary resources to satisfy her customers, she decided to work with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with whom she is on her first individual loan. Her five solidarity (group) loans were repaid properly. This individual loan will allow her to buy lots of clothing. She gets her supplies in Bamako and resells the clothing in cash and on credit, at home to a mixed clientele from different areas of the city of Bougouni.\r\nWith this loan, she foresees realizing an average monthly profit of 45,000 FCFA. This profit will allow her to pay the interest on her loan and invest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1580652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-04-12T18:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-12T18:00:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aoua ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50543.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677012},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50543.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658543},{"amount":99.86,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50543.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.39,"payment_id":595318638},{"amount":90.13,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-10T11:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50543.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.12,"payment_id":636515241}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T17:07:44Z","paid_date":"2015-05-10T11:00:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":696098,"name":"Cristy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cristy previously accessed a 15,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase quantities of raw materials, such as fabric, thread and other materials, needed in her business.

She gets these products in Koutiala and sells them at home to a diverse clientele.\r\nWhile the other Djiguiya group members intend to realize a monthly profit of 105,000 FCFA each during this loan cycle, Ms. Ma\u00efmouna intends to realize a monthly profit of 110,000 FCFA.\r\nIn addition to repaying their loans, the group members will use a portion of their income to pay for personal expenses and increase their capital.\r\nThey hope to strengthen this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso so that their stocks are not sparse."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1580676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy ingredients to make fruit juice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-04-12T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-12T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T20:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":43606.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479264132},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":43606.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490961020},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":43606.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677370},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":43606.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677015},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":43606.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209582},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":43606.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658546}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T14:53:19Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T17:17:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":696110,"name":"Josie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Josie, 46, a resident of Payatas, Philippines.
