She has been in this business for three years now. Her business is open from 6 am to 9 pm daily and she is able to make a fair monthly return. Nuru is in her early thirties and is single. \r\n\r\nThis is Nuru\u2019s sixth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans, all of which were paid back successfully, to restock her food cooking ingredients like rice, cooking oil, maize and baking flour.

The group is composed of women who know each other from family and neighborhood ties. They are family women with the average age of 47 years old. They live in large traditional families in Teshie-Accra, Ghana.\r\n\r\nThe group members, like Helen, who is the first person standing from the left in the photo, engage in the buying and selling of fish. They have been in this type of small-scale commerce for several years and are highly sought after.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the growing need of their customers, the group members decided to join the ID Ghana's loan program. They are on their seventh group loan.\r\n\r\nHelen is the featured borrower of this group from Teshie, where she excels at selling fish. She plans to use her loan to buy a large amount of fish. She procures her goods from the harbor at a wholesale price and makes her sales in the market at retail for cash to a mixed group of customers. She hopes to earn a good monthly profit which will allow her to pay back the loan and to reinvest in her business of selling fish. She also wants to save part of her earnings.\r\n\r\nThe group needs a total amount of GHS 5,000 to enable them to serve customers better.

Her oldest child is ten years old and the youngest one is three years old. She lives with her children in Hodeidah, Yemen. Fatima is a hardworking woman who dreams of providing her children with a better future, but her capital is very small. Now, she works selling cosmetics and women's clothes in the street. The income of her business is very low and she has many challenges to improve it. Unfortunately, she doesn't have enough money to do that. For this reason, she applied for a loan of 30,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more cosmetics, perfumes, and incense, as well as women's clothes to resell.\r\n\r\nFatima looks forward to providing her family with a lot of money.

She is pleased that she is able to provide good support for her family.\r\n\r\nIn addition to receiving loans, Irma and the rest of the ladies receive monthly training from a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer on topics like business administration, budgeting and marketing, accounting and customer service. Other subjects presented include health, nutrition and medicinal plants, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, and self-esteem. As many of the women have had little or no education, this training is quite valuable and relevant.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of her fellow Trust Bank members, Irma thanks Kiva investors for their confidence and generosity in providing these much-needed loans.

Prospero is a responsible, hard-working man, known in the area for his warm heart and good nature.  His most recent harvest is in now and stored in the silos that are pictured in the photo.  All that's left to do with the last harvest, he says, is sell it and now it's time to think about the next crop.  That's why he's applying for a new INTEGRAL loan that he will use to buy the supplies he needs--seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, etc.--to carry on his business.  What he wants most, he says, is to bring in a bumper crop, bigger than any he's brought in before because the better the result, the better he can provide for his family.

With a lot of dedication he grows corn which enables him to bring him the daily bread to his home. He describes himself as a hardworking, honorable and responsible man. He lives with his wife and daughter in the family home. Together with his wife they work very hard to get their family ahead and give themselves the best living conditions that they had. \r\n\r\nIt is thanks to his knowledge in agriculture that Juan is able to provide for the household, given that it is the only manner that he knows of making his living in an honorable way. With a keen desire to succeed, he approached this communal bank to seek a loan as the season for sowing has started and he needs to start sowing as soon as possible. It is for this reason that he is seeking the loan as he needs to invest in the purchase of the agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and so on for sowing, as you can see in the photograph. He trusts in God and in his work with which he will succeed in having an abundant harvest that will allow him to have a better quality of life for himself and his family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1575933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, and so on.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-04-13T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-13T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Severine","image":923999}},{"id":696450,"name":"Adelfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelfa is 38 years old and has seven children.

She has always worked in the beauty field and related occupations.\r\n\r\nShe studied hairdressing several years ago and has worked in this field since then. However, sometimes her work and her needs have absorbed her so much that she has had to abandon her beauty school studies twice due to financial difficulties and time issues. She is hardworking and persevering. She has a young spirit and does not give up on her goals. Therefore, she is throwing herself into her studies once again so that she can finish her degree. In this moment, it is very important to earn a degree, to get up to speed, and to learn as much as possible to achieve this.\r\n\r\nShe has many goals for herself and for her daughter. She loves her daughter, who needs and deserves a better future. An old friend brought her to Campo Alto, where she is now attending classes with a slightly flexible schedule and which she can also finance with a Kiva loan so that the payment is more affordable for her.

Vali's wife is a homemaker and a very hardworking and caring mother.\r\n\r\nVali himself works in home construction. He has been working in this field for many years and knows all the intricacies of this work. He receives an acceptable income from his occupation, enough to cover the costs of living. But he has a dream - Vali wants to build a big house for his family. For this, however, he needs money, since his earnings aren't enough to cover building expenses. Therefore Vali has turned to Arvand to receive a loan to purchase construction materials to build a new home. Vali hopes for a favourable result and thanks Arvand in advance for the

Since her parents did not have financial resources for her to study, she went to live in Bogot\u00e1 with her aunt Carmen, who involved her in the household duties. She studied at night, but she was physically abused and otherwise mistreated, so she decided to leave and look for work. She started working in family homes, but her father visited her every two weeks and took away what little money she made, convincing her that it was for savings.\r\n\r\nSome time later, she found a boyfriend and moved in with him. She continued to work in family homes. Shortly afterwards, she got pregnant and realized the man she was with was crazy and not good for her. She fought for her son, but she always dreamed of studying and finishing high school. A short time later, the relationship changed and the mentality of both partners was to move forward. They looked for opportunities to study and supported each other. They came to Campo Alto and signed up to finish high school with night classes, since they were working. Later, they found out that there was an opportunity to study a degree to become a nursing assistant there. Mar\u00eda signed up for this degree with her husband's support. Since there was not enough money for both, he decided to withdraw and give her the opportunity to study.\r\n\r\nShe is currently in her second semester. In the afternoons, she works in a beauty salon, and at night she finishes her school studies. During what little free time she has, she takes care of the household, her son, and the chores. However, she realizes that her husband is the one who gives her financial support and that this is a burden for him. She sees that his dreams are being frustrated, but she says that she wants to move forward and do everything she can to achieve her goal and graduate so that she can be the one who helps others. She then found out about the financial support which Kiva could offer her, and she became interested in receiving this financial help so that she does not falter on her path and so that she can achieve her dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1576072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She did not lack anything with them, but things started to change and her parents separated unexpectedly. It was very difficult at the beginning, because her mother was now responsible for her and her siblings. For obvious reasons, they no longer had the same comforts. However, with time, she realized that she had to keep fighting for what she wanted, because she was always an optimistic girl with ideals.\r\n\r\nSome years went by, and she graduated from high school. This was a very important achievement for her, and it was then when her dreams began to come true. She found a job which allowed her to earn her own income. She decided to continue developing, and she started to pay for studies at an educational center, focusing on administration. \r\n\r\nAlthough she had a financial income, this did not allow her to pay her studies in full. Therefore, she came to Kiva through an agreement with CampoAlto, where she studies. She can then continue studying so that she can have her own company one day. She still continues to study. She is in her second semester of a Business Administration degree at CampoAlto, which is opening doors to a young woman who is full of hopes and dreams.

She also has her high school diploma in science and letters, but the main source of income for her family is in coffee production.  She has a partner with whom she is not married but they have been together for several years and her partner works selling medicinal and natural products.   Together they have a five month old child. Currently Belinda lives with her mother because she helps with the baby and her partner travels most of the time.  Besides working as a nurse in a private clinic in the city, Belinda also learned to plant coffee from a very young age by watching her parents.  She used to help them with the work on the property where she grew up. Four years ago her father gave her a plot of land and since that time she has been growing coffee.  Her customers are intermediaries who at times lend money or fertilizers in order to help with her crops in exchange for her selling them all of her crop.  Her land is far from her home, almost an hour away walking, and at certain times there is a great deal of car traffic, but during most of the year they cannot get rides and must walk.  When harvest time comes her brothers help her with the harvest but she also has to pay other laborers.  \r\n\r\nBelinda has two blocks of cultivated land but half a block has been affected by disease and needs to be replanted. She also has to re-fertilize that section and also the healthy sections.  For that reason she is asking for a loan in order to buy agricultural products in order to attend to her crops and take advantage of this new season.  Belinda has as a goal at this moment increasing her land so that when he son grows up she will be able to provide him with a good education."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1576857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy agricultural products in order to replant and fertilize her coffee crop.

She considers her business to be profitable, as it has allowed her to meet many financial challenges, such as how to help her husband with the household expenses. She supplements her work by selling replacement parts for vehicles. She likes her occupation because it allows her to be at home and care for her small children. On the other hand, she does not like that sometimes she is not able to sell all of her products within the established time frame.\r\n\r\nShe plans to continue, and to grow her business, looking to increase her sales. On this occasion she is seeking a loan of 800 Nuevos Soles, and she is very thankful for the opportunity that she has been given, and for the financial backing that she needs to move forward. With the requested amount she will purchase plantains, rice, eggs, oil, and sugar, as these are the principal products that she sells every day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1576871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase edible goods such as plantains, rice, eggs, oil, and sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2014-04-13T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-13T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":123.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":132.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":139.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":147.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.13,"local_amount":123.02,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-03T11:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":129.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480258640},{"amount":45.44,"local_amount":121.17,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-02T12:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":127.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491502709},{"amount":49.55,"local_amount":132.12,"processed_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-03T12:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":139.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504306636},{"amount":103.68,"local_amount":276.48,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-02T12:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":291.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":545007253},{"amount":55.2,"local_amount":147.21,"processed_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-02T12:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":155.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":545007392}],"funded_date":"2014-04-16T22:00:45Z","paid_date":"2015-10-02T12:12:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":696540,"name":"Meriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meriam is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a rice-vending  business in the Philippines.

She is married to Mardy, a driver and they have children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRosalie operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell the materials to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her currently revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors.\r\n \r\nRosalie hopes to be more successful in business and dreams of having a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the word of God she studies.* \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She grows coffee in one section and another part involves working with her father and younger brother. They work there in the mornings while she stays behind and takes them breakfast and lunch. Once the coffee beans are harvested she sells them to a local person who buys, processes, and sells the product to specialist coffee stores in the town.\r\n\r\nDania is seeking a loan to buy manure and special food for the coffee plants so that production increases in the forthcoming season, and to hire laborers to help her look after the plants.

She is a dark-skinned woman with black hair and dark eyes.  These eyes convey tiredness, as she has spent nearly six hours walking with a cardboard box and a colorful bag in her tired hands, which contain new clothing and a few perfume bottles that are left over from last month for her to sell for the day.   \r\n\r\nShe has been a single mother since she was 28 years old and she has to pay for her children's education.  She discovered a passion for being a businesswoman and she decided to expand her work through MiCr\u00e9dito-KIVA loans.

She lives together with her husband, Luis, with whom she has a little girl.  Her little one still stays with them, because she is only two years old.  They live in Santo Domingo de los Colorados, a city with a lovely climate, known in Ecuador because the Tsachila ethnic group lives there.  \r\n\r\nTania is a very hardworking young lady.  For two years now she has worked as a mobile clothes vendor.  She passes through the neighborhoods in the company of her husband.  They work at this business because her father-in-law has given them a plot of land, and little by little, with these earnings they have been able to build their home.

She is 25 years old and has a secondary education. She really enjoys reading fiction-genre literature. Sulhija's mother is retired. Her brothers are labor migrants in Russia in order to improve the financial situation of their family. Despite the fact that her brothers are supporting her family, Sulhija does not sit idly. For several years already, she has been sewing ethnic Tajik clothing on a by-order basis. Her services are in demand amongst the female population of her village. Her fellow villagers really respect her as Sulhija treats her work with love and applies all of her knowledge so that, of course, it shows up in her work as a result. Sulhija has partnered with Arvand over the course of three years and is grateful she is able to turn to them for help when she needs to. She wants to take out a loan to develop her business and buy a sewing machine capable of embroidery."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1581574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She has a lot of experience in this field. Istamoy possesses the highest level of professionalism; that being said, she knows the limits of her abilities and suggests that her patients go to other specialists when needed.<br \/><br \/>Now Istamoy wants to buy equipment for her clinic. However, she does not have a lot of money on hand which is why she decided to take out a loan. Istamoy is planning to buy a therapeutic apparatus which she really needs. She hopes that, with your support, she will be able to buy this apparatus for diagnosing and treating her ill patients.

He is an only child and he lives with his mother who is a professor with the National Learning Service (SENA). Thanks to his academic excellence and his accomplishments, Juan David was awarded a scholarship for his entire undergraduate program, earning a degree in Sound Engineering from the University of San Buenaventura in February of 2013.\r\n\r\nJuan David\u2019s dream is to earn a Masters of Acoustics degree at one of the best universities in France, The University of Maine. In order to accomplish this he needs to seek Kiva\u2019s support, as it is the only way that he will be able to cover the costs of French certification. Once he earns his Master\u2019s degree and returns to Colombia, Juan David looks forward to working as a professor and researcher, in order to share his expertise and support the development of this area of knowledge in the country, in addition to implementing projects that take into account the problems of noise pollution in the cities, and seek solutions in order to improve the environment for the population.\r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nIn the year 2004, when in my high school History class we came to Ancient Greece and its magnificent theaters, that could hold from five to eight thousand people in an age in which nothing existed for amplifying the voice, I asked: How were some five thousand people able to hear the performance?  This was a question that no one in the high school was able to answer for me, but I did not stop going over and over it in my mind until someone told me that this was one of the mysteries of acoustics. \r\n\r\nSince then, I have been fascinated by Acoustics, and I decided that I wanted to understand all acoustic phenomena, in order to reveal its mysteries. I completed my undergraduate work in Sound Engineering, becoming one of the first professionals in this field in my city, and one of few in the country.\r\n\r\nAs an undergraduate I discovered that the scope of Acoustics ranges from things as complicated as echograms in medicine to the intelligibility of the word in a simple conversation. However, as Acoustics is a field that is just beginning to be studied in Colombia, no post-graduate programs exist in the country in this area. Although an investigation has revealed the mystery of the Greek theaters, my goal now is to earn a Masters of Acoustics at one of the best universities in France, and bring my knowledge home in order to share it with all those who at one time have asked the same question I asked, and support the development of this area of knowledge in my country.  \r\n\r\nAlthough I have the support of my family in achieving this dream, my mother cannot cover costs as high as these, as her economic situation is limited.

Three years ago, Gulsara started fattening up and selling cattle in order to help her husband provide for their family. However, she really likes this business as it does not require a lot of time or physical effort. It's now spring and fresh grass is growing everywhere, which is the best feed for cattle.

She has been with this business for 12 years and it has returned her 25,500 KHR per day. This is the fourth cycle loan for her with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The three past loans, which she has repaid, have enabled her to upgrade her lifestyle. Now, she is the group leader of three borrowers who are requesting a loan. She and her joint-borrowers are seeking a loan of 1,400,000 KHR each. As the leader, she will spend her entire loan portion to buy fertilizer and to pay plowing fees for her cassava field. She has high hopes that she will gain a better yield than before."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1577223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and to pay plowing fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Tbaung Khmum district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-04-14T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-14T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokhom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sreymao","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1042.5,"local_amount":4170000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T11:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4170000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624987014},{"amount":7.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":30000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636488329}],"funded_date":"2014-05-02T17:30:30Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:29:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":696627,"name":"Saumu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saumu is a businesswoman who is very hardworking.
