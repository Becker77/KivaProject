Since the salary of her husband is very low, she decided 8 years ago to start her own business, which allows her to help her husband with the household expenses.

She hopes to achieve this through the means of this loan, since in spite of having the store for a number of years she has not had money to invest in it, since the majority of the earnings have been

K. is thirty-five years old, married, and has five children aged between fourteen and two years old. Her business is located at Mariakani estate in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is in the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the Indian ocean white beaches.\r\n\r\nShe provides tailoring services to the local people. She also makes clothes and displays them for sale to her customers. She has been in this business for fifteen years now and has three employees. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is tied-up capital since some customers order clothes to be made and then refuse to pick up the clothes, and so she has to put them on display for other people to buy them later.

She has gained experience in her business.  She used to work in a dressmaking workshop and learned the manufacturing process and also how to sell.  She then set up her own workshop.  At first she worked with a partner but her commitment and motivation to grow and make more income in order to provide for her 12 year-old daughter's well-being and education, drove her to start working independently.  She undertook her great challenge, supported by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization from which she has received 7 loans and managed to increase her infrastructure.  She acquired machines that helped her to reduce her production time and increase the quality of her garments.  She was also able to buy raw materials in larger volumes which helped her to have a better range of products to offer.\r\n\r\nAlthough everything Viviana has done hasn't been successful, she has always managed to get ahead.  For example, she spent a lot of money in dissolving her partnership and she wanted to set up a store but it was not successful.  Viviana is always motivated to make progress because she has a daughter for whom she is solely responsible and because her business principles for personal improvement demand it.  For this reason, her highest priority is to manage to turn her small workshop into a large garment factory which provides lots of people with a source of income and benefits Colombian families.

Evelyne thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more drinks for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130711},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130712},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027507},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613508},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010587},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232876},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664677},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105408},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022553},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867802}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T17:52:43Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":88368,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes A. sells groceries and food supplies like maize, beans, and rice at BRM junction.

They live in large traditional extended families with their children, husbands, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, etc.  They average 35 years of age and at least 5 children each.  They work mainly in growing peanuts and millet. \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their farms profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program two years ago.  After having correctly repaid the first loan, they are now on their second farm loan.  The current loan will be used to buy a sufficient quantity of seeds for planting peanuts and millet;  some minor supplies and equipment; and some fertilizers and the like, for farming.  These items are gotten at the grand marketplace of Koutiala.  After wintering, the crops are stored for a time, so that they gain in value.  And then they are sold at the same marketplace and at surrounding marketplaces at the retail level (often wholesale), in cash transactions with customers generally from large cities. \r\n\r\nThe group members each intend to realize, after selling their agricultural products, an average profit of 55,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":329204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilzers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aghatie  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucienne  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernadette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernadette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suzane Th\u00e9odore  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djen\u00e8bou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u00c9dite Edimen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madeleine   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":545000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":545000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":545000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":555473.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152125}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T23:20:27Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117040,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary A. started her smoked fish sales nine years ago at Suhum, in the eastern region of Ghana.

She buys stocks of fish from the fishermen and has them smoked at a nearby stand. She has a high customer base who will travel from surrounding villages to buy from her stand.

The region is dedicated to commerce, cattle-raising (for both meat and milk) and agriculture. \r\n<p>\r\nRecently, Carolina was separated from her husband and since her two children are small, she wished to start a micro-enterprise, installing a small restaurant serving local dishes in her own home. She says that in this manner she could help with household expenses and she would not have to go out of the house, leaving her children.  In the past, she has worked in restaurants large and small, giving her sufficient experience.  Also, she has seen that it is a very good business and that it would be well received in her community.\r\n<p>\r\nShe needs to borrow $1,175 to buy merchandise to sell, plus a refrigerator, a deep fat fryer, and a blender, among other utensils necessary to start her business.  This would enable her to provide good service to her neighbors.\r\n<p>\r\nCarolina belongs to La Esperanza Womens Community Credit organization, which helps women who are non-professionals or heads of households.  It is one of 100 organizations associated with EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan. With it she hopes to continue her personal and economic development and to participate actively in the credit organization in her community.          \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty food products in the local community. Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 8,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elizabeth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Elizabeth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients can run their businesses successfully. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a pupuser\u00eda called Rosita which is very famous and popular as the pupusas Rosa makes have an unbeatable taste and she sells them at a good price.  In addition, her business is very hygienic and she treats her customers well.  For Rosa, the most productive work is that which is produced by the hands of a happy person and she tries to pass this on to her customers.  Rosa is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL so that she can buy raw materials such as cheese, beans, fried pork rinds, 'loroco' (a native vine with edible flowers), drinks and other products so that she can make and sell her delicious pupusas.  Rosa hopes that her business will enable her to continue covering her household needs and that it will be useful for her family in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":768792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Mar\u00eda's goal is to have her own shop, since she currently has a street cart and thus her dream is to have her own store and for it to be adequate to meet demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":912997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase skirts, dresses, pants, blouses and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T19:20:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De La Paz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":59.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":67.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":69.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98.4,"local_amount":98.4,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":98.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250855834},{"amount":50.96,"local_amount":50.96,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257265546},{"amount":55.33,"local_amount":55.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":55.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263406743},{"amount":114.04,"local_amount":114.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":114.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276738203},{"amount":381.27,"local_amount":381.27,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":381.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283228639}],"funded_date":"2011-12-28T00:23:38Z","paid_date":"2012-06-16T08:55:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":359685,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yolanda de 36 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera con 3 hijos.

Love for her family has motivated to work hard all this time and has contributed to the growth of her business.<p>\r\nCurrently, Maria is requesting a loan of $750, which will be used to purchase supplies so she can sell products in more markets and continue growing her business. She plans to repay the loan within six to 12 months. You can be a fundamental part of the growth of this business and contribute to the well being of Maria and her family. She is sincerely grateful for your support.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Maria Soledad es casada y tiene cuatro hijos, de 28, 29, 32 y 34 a\u00f1os de edad.

Each member is receiving an average loan of 635.00 Guaran\u00ed. <p>\r\nThe committee was started thanks to the leadership of Mrs. Mar\u00eda S., who found out that Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya offers a program designed exclusively for working women. She invited her colleagues and neighbors to join the program, and that is how the group called \u201cRenacer\u201d emerged. <p>\r\nThe women all own different types of businesses, like general stores, beverage sales, preparation and sales of chipas (Paraguayan bread), kiosks, and plant sales. <p>\r\nThe committee is currently planning to carry out beautification projects such as cleaning up sidewalks and empty lots, and improving the plaza and the neighborhood soccer field so that the children can have a safe recreational place. <p>\r\nMrs. Carolina M. is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya because this foundation has allowed her to be a part of this program that has taught her so much.

Her business consists in selling charcoal, which is very profitable in Lom\u00e9 where charcoal is very much used to cook food. She started this business in 1999, and turns a good profit because she gets her supply in the interior of the country where sacks of charcoal are less expensive. Wanting to bolster her business, she's seeking a loan from Kiva's partner WAGES in order to purchase sacks of charcoal. She's divorced from her husband and has two children. She works hard to support them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

She always like to feel useful and efficient, and she never stops working.  She started out selling sweets and later sold liquors.  Now she is involved with selling clothing.  For the last five years she has been trying to bring various articles of clothing to her neighbors who aren't able to visit the stores in the city center due to lack of time or isolation.  Antonia doesn't pretend to only sell clothing, but also yearns to remodel her house to create a store, to give her a break from her long hours spent traveling by foot after all these years.  This is her thirteenth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and during all of the time that she has been working with her group she can say that things have been improving thanks to the involvement of every one of the participants.

Tagda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is married to Edgardo P., who drives a motorcycle to shuttle passengers around their community and also manages the operations of the two motorized fishing boats they own. Aside from being a business women, she also works as a clerk in their barangay (Village Council), and the salary she earns supplements their family income.The couple has two children who are only 4 and 5 years old. They are the reason Analyn strives so hard in her business ventures \u2013 so that she can provide her children with financial security and be able to send them to good schools.\r\n<p>\r\nThe couple\u2019s eagerness to attain their dream is the driving force behind all their endeavors. It was actually Edgardo who encouraged Analyn to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 so that she could start her own business. Her first venture, after she joined NWTF-PD, was selling fish in her community and the nearby barangays. She immediately saw that it could provide her family with a good income because, even with the small capital she started with, she was able to help her husband pay for some of the household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nAnalyn continued with her business activities and expanded by selling capiz shells to a handicraft maker. With a more steady income, she was able to pay her loan installments on time and establish a good credit performance with her group, center and NWTF-PD. Accordingly, she has been able to increase her loan amount at each new loan cycle, enabling her to afford a motorized fishing boat. From the profits of her fishing venture, she bought a motorcycle with a sidecar for her husband to enable him to add to their daily income. Her husband operates it when there's bad weather conditions or when there's trouble with the fishing boat. As their business activities improved, she was able to buy a second motorized fishing boat and hire a helper to operate it. Analyn continues to sell the fish catch in the public market and around their community.  This earns her a minimum of 7,000 pesos per month. She has been able to save for her children\u2019s future, pay her debts on time and cover household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her 11th  loan cycle, she borrowed 29,000 pesos to add to her working capital. When she paid that off, within the loan term and without any delays, she applied for a 12th loan of 29,000 pesos so that she could have revolving working capital for her business ventures: fishing, fish vending and selling capiz shell. She intends to save some of her income for her children.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable.

He is 46 years old, married and has three children, all of whom are in school. He is also raising two orphans. \r\n\r\nRichard is a businessman who makes a living running a bakery that he inherited from his father and has successfully run for more than 10 years. He sells his goods to people in suburbs, secondary schools, a local college and in other shops. His main challenge is securing the ingredients he needs to bake, such as flour and oil. \r\n\r\nRichard has a motorcycle that makes it easy for him to distribute bread, doughnuts, cookies, pancakes, kebabs and chapattis. His dream is to open a store in a suburban town and buy a van so that he can expand his customer base and make enough money to send his children to college. He has applied for this loan to buy more raw materials for baking such as firewood, flour and cooking oil. Without loans like this, his business would not be nearly as successful as it is.

Currently she is continuing this business and she reports that she is doing well and is becoming well-known in her neighborhood. \r\n\r\nWith this loan of 3,000 Nuevos Soles, she will buy medicines such as: Ibuprofen, Aspirin, and other basic medicines. \r\n\r\nIsabelita, as she is known by those who are close to her, feels satisfied and happy with what she has achieved. She is very thankful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for their help. Her dream is to supply her business with more medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva

She finished secondary school at the age of 20 and got married. Kulmira\u2019s husband worked at the local factory as a driver but his wage was too low to meet the needs of his growing family. To find an additional means of income, Kulmira and her husband started to sell vegetables at the market. This brought in a regular profit, which afterwards became the basis for a livestock-breeding business in which, with much effort, Kulmira achieved success. The level of the family's existence began to gradually improve, but in 2005 Kulmira\u2019s husband died suddenly and she became the only bread-winner. She had a hard time, but didn\u2019t give in doing everything she could to stabilize her children\u2019s life. Today Kulmira has two cows and one horse at her farm. Also, with the help of her youngest son, Kulmira has broadened her business by selling meat products at the market. Kulmira wants a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy bull-calves to fatten and resell. With the revenue from this investment, Kulmira plans to buy a house for her son, who is now serving in the army. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the most vulnerable population.

En la actualidad est\u00e1n a\u00fan en el punto de equilibrio,  porque no quer\u00edan endeudarse si no estaban organizados para pagar puntualmente. Como el esposo de Luz empez\u00f3 a trabajar como vigilante, han decidido iniciar su vida crediticia con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual recurren a su credikiva, adem\u00e1s de querer responder a su  necesidad  de crecer que sin este apoyo est\u00e1 limitada por la falta de capital de trabajo disponible para comprar todos los productos de la canasta familiar que sus clientes exigen cada vez m\u00e1s; Con su credikiva, surtir\u00e1n la tienda con productos de mayor salida porque en el futuro desean emprender una nueva actividad simult\u00e1nea a la tienda: vender comidas r\u00e1pidas y este es justamente su mayor desaf\u00edo.    ","en":"Luz P. P. is the owner of \u201cTienda La Cale\u00f1a\u201d where she sells retail products such as food, provisions, soft drinks, and liquor.  This activity became part of her vocation in 2008 when she came to the northern coast of Colombia with her husband and two children, who are now 14 and 21 years old.  With the severance pay her husband received from his job, Luz started her business with little capital.  She gradually acquired fixed assets and stocked her business in small quantities.  At the moment, she has reached a point of equilibrium so she does not want to accumulate debt unless she is organized enough to make her payments on time.  Since her husband started a job as a security guard, Luz decided to begin building her credit record with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  This is why she has returned for a Kiva loan.  In addition, she wants to respond to her need for growth because without this support, Luz is limited by her lack of capital for buying all of the everyday products that her customers are demanding.  \r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan, Luz will stock her store with products that have high turnover.  In the future she wants to start a new business in addition to her store, selling fast food.  This will be her greatest challenge.

","en":"Houenoussou III is a group composed of sixteen people, whose president (who is raising her hand on the picture) is named Pascaline. The group's members live in the same village in Benin. In order to increase their working capital, this group is requesting a loan from ALID\u00e9 for the second time.\r\nBorn in Benin in 1970, Pascaline lives together with her husband and children in a town in Benin. She is married to a farmer named Dieudonn\u00e9 and has four children, who all attend school. Pascaline provides for the family's various expenses together with her husband. She never went to school.\r\nFor about eight years, Pascaline has been producing palm oil, which she sells out of her home. In parallel to this activity, Pascaline sells fabrics. This business generates revenues and helps her to contribute to family expenses. Pascaline purchases her products at one of Benin's markets.\r\nThis first loan will certainly allow Pascaline and the other members of the Houenoussou III group to raise their level of activity, grow their clientele and increase profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":789827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy 20 tubs of palm fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-06-15T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yvette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victorine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L\u00e9ocadie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dop\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simone","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suzanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djinantou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"C\u00e9lestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ak\u00e8gnid\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kar\u00e8ne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":660000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94300},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94300},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94300},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94300},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94300},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94300},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.74},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":210.75,"local_amount":94300,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":95142.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216443869},{"amount":210.74,"local_amount":94300,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":95142.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221608239},{"amount":210.75,"local_amount":94300,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":95142.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226977772},{"amount":210.74,"local_amount":94300,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":95142.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232737152},{"amount":210.75,"local_amount":94300,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":95142.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238541865},{"amount":210.75,"local_amount":94300,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":95142.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244501492},{"amount":210.52,"local_amount":94200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":95041.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251061855}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T22:03:55Z","paid_date":"2012-01-17T08:41:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":310491,"name":"Chamrouen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chamrouen, 59 years old, is a weaver.

He runs a used clothing store in Kissy which is a neighborhood in Freetown.  He also takes care of two relatives.\r\n\r\nHassan has owned this business for 30 years.  He also earns income from renting out a house.

All members are from the municipality of San Bernardo, located in the city of Santiago. \r\n\r\nPaola is a member of this communal bank. In the photo she is squatting in the front row on the left, wearing a horizontally striped shirt and flowery trousers. She has been working in commerce for five years, selling groceries and vegetables at a stall she established in the front garden of her mother's house, which is where she lives with her parents, siblings, husband, and two children aged four years and two months.\r\n\r\nPaola explains that she had a greengrocers shop, but had to relocate her business to her mother's house as she was pregnant and had to sacrifice herself to her work. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Paolo will buy wholesale vegetables, toilet paper and detergent for her store. Her business goals are to stock her store with more goods and obtain the municipal patent for her business which will allow her to sell her products. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve the income generated from her business and provide a better quality of life for her family. She also longs to own her own home and for this she needs to apply for a housing subsidy. \r\n\r\nPaola is very pleased with and grateful for the support provided by Fondo Esperanza, as the loan allows her to invest in her business. She has also said that the communal bank meetings have helped her learn more about the group which she is a part of.\r\n\r\nSan Bernardo is a city located 18 km directly south of the main square of Santiago (the capital of Chile). It is known as the capital of folklore as in January each year the International Folklore Festival takes place, an event where the country's roots come together and musical groups from all over South America meet. San Bernardo also hosts the Traditional Crafts Fair, which features both Chilean craftsmen and those from other nearby countries. In April, an event called 'Abril Cuecas Mil' takes place which consists of dancing cueca (Chilean folk dance) throughout the entire district.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":929048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wholesale vegetables, toilet paper and detergent for sale in her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"San Bernardo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-11-26T09:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oscar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gissela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lissette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marjorie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1277550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":84114},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":86661},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87487},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":88321},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":89163},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90015},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":90872},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":91739},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":92617},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":93498},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":94390},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":95294},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":96201},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97178}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.31},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.61},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":835.64,"local_amount":435746,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":436373.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772346},{"amount":700.44,"local_amount":365243,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":365769.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257180793},{"amount":727.56,"local_amount":379383,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":379929.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315248},{"amount":186.36,"local_amount":97178,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":97317.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270031438}],"funded_date":"2011-12-01T22:36:07Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:21:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Fiona Craig","image":null}},{"id":367893,"name":"Severino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Severino is 53 and has two school-aged children.

She worked hard to provide for her family, but she was unable to see the income coming in through her hard work.  In 1994, Ms. N. joins this organization in hope to better her family financially.  In the beginning, she was able to borrow and use the loan to invest in raising farm animals.  But in 2008, she got the courage to switch business from raising livestock to purchasing 2 sewing machines and started accepting workloads from several companies.  Ms. N. is a very skilled with her hands.  In addition to her work, she buys fabric to make pieces of clothing to sell in the local market.  She also offers tailoring services to the people in her village.  The family monthly income between raising farm animals and her sewing works average in about 4 to 5.000.000d\/month.  After a period of borrowing and investing, the family financial status has improved and since been stable.  She was able to build a 2 story home, furnishing it with quality items that have values.  She is requesting a loan of 19.000.000d to buy more sewing machines and capital for a convenient store business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva

But thanks to SMT\u2019s loans, she was able to gradually get herself off the ground once again.\r\n\r\nPreviously, she received Le 600,000.00 from Kiva through SMT. The loan helped her business and improved her livelihood. She thanks God for that loan as it enabled her to solve her numerous problems. She has repaid it successfully and is today requesting a loan of Le 800,000.00 to help further strengthen her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu was born in Kabala and is forty years of age. She is married with four children. One of her daughters is already married, two are in school and the last is not yet of school age. Her husband trades in cows and she trades in miscellaneous items. She sells items like palm oil, kola nuts, dishes, clothes, cigarettes, cheese and so on. She buys some of the goods she sells in Freetown (about 570 miles round-trip) because of the cheaper prices in Freetown. She buys the other items in Bo, the country\u2019s second largest city, located in southern Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Isatu is planning to buy more inventory so that the amount of profit she makes will increase. With a lot of profit, she will be able to solve her household problems, assist her children in their schooling and buy herself a piece of land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":219167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Business Expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-10-29T21:50:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-13T00:26:38Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":101578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968662},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":101578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885049},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":101578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434511},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":101578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128864},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025654},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":101578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611596},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008458},{"amount":34.35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101578.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230813}],"funded_date":"2008-10-29T23:26:38Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deborah Kerman","image":193796}},{"id":76112,"name":"Haydee","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"hola mi nombre es Haydee V. me dedico a la venta de productos de consumo popular, el nombre de mi pulperia es Xiomara, tengo un a\u00f1o de haber inagurado mi negocio, en estos momentos mi negocio es peque\u00f1o pero tengo muchos deseos de superme y hacer crecer mi negocio lo mas que pueda, soy casada pero ya mi hijo esta grande y no tengo obligaciones con el, porque el ya formo su hogar, mi esposo es alba\u00f1il y los dos salimos adelante con los gastos de nuestro hogar, estoy solicitando este credito para poder hacer que mi negocio sea mas grande y asi tener mejores ganancias, estoy feliz ya que me va bien en mi negocio y mis clientes me prefieren porque la atencion que les doy es especial.","en":"My name is Haydee V. and I sell grocery products in my small store called Xiomara.

What he likes about his jobs is that they keep him busy\u2014since he is a very active man\u2014and that they generate good profits for him because his products (the cassava and the wood) sell quickly at the market. In the future, he would like to export starch. This is his 3rd loan with MFP. He likes to work with his microfinance institute because his fellow members are respectful and work in harmony. With the loan that he is requesting, he will purchase wood, thus taking advantage of the summer season in his region, which is when lumber is in high demand. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

Pontevedra, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nWith such a big family, Erlinda and her husband have tried several business ventures over the years. They mostly farmed their small landholding which was very dependent on the whims of nature. It was not until Erlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 that they were able to really experience more stability in their financial situation. She used her first cycle loan to start a \"Sari-sari\" store - the local version of a general store where everyone can buy anything and everything that has a demand within the area - from foodstuff like canned and baked goods to charcoal and kerosene gas for fuel and even some hardware and farm implements. She also went into food vending and even raised a few heads of cattle over the years.\r\n\r\nShe used her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon to buy ducklings to raise. It proved to be a good venture to pursue that she invested most of her subsequent loans to this activity, and it now earns her family an additional PHP 2,000.00 per month. Erlinda's last loan of PHP 17,000 was paid off on time, and now she is borrowing PHP 22,000.00 for her 16th cycle loan to purchase more ducklings to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nRaising ducks has not only proved to be a profitable activity for Erlinda and her family, the ducks are also very eco-friendly: they provide natural pest control by eating the insects and other pests in the fields, leave organic fertilizer and tamp down the weeds in the rice fields where they feed. \r\n\r\nErlinda hopes that in the future, the business ventures that she and her husband started will be able to support the families of their children, and make life more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Her husband works in construction applying stucco; they get along very well as a married couple as they help each other with household expenses. They do not own a house and for that reason they live in a house that they have barrowed from a brother. \r\n<P>\r\nJulia is a seamstress; she learned this trade by herself. For the past five years she has worked on order making pants, suits, jackets, skirts, etc. Because she works at home she does not have a fixed work schedule but almost everyday she works from 9am to 12pm, and from 2pm until the late hours in the evening given that she has to share her time with household chores. \r\n<P>\r\nThis is her third loan cycle working with the foundation; she feels very thankful because thanks to the loans that she has been granted she has been able to repair two sewing machines and to purchase an iron. \r\n<P>\r\nWith this loan that she has acquired she will obtain a gas stove that she is missing. \r\n<P>\r\nHer goal is to study how to cut and fashion clothing to earn a tailor title. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva

She makes handicrafts from tagua (a large nut with an interior that looks and feels like ivory and can be carved into handicrafts.)  She started in this business when she worked in a factory and learned the trade.  Three years ago she became independent and, with an investment of 400 dollars, she bought a machine to cut the tagua.  Her work consists in cutting shapes for buttons.  To do this she travels to the city of Manta, where she acquires the raw materials.  She then makes her products and delivers them to a person who is in charge of sending them to other countries where they are given a final finish.  She does not have a set schedule but she works 8 hours a day.  As she works alone, she must organize herself to take the orders and avoid mistakes with the delivery of her work, because she must divide her time well between the work and her household tasks.  Each week she must have sufficient raw materials on hand in order to fulfill her orders on time.\r\n\r\nMariana joined the communal bank 2 loan cycles ago, and the money that she will receive from this loan will be invested in the purchase of tagua, because at this moment her workshop is small but she aspires to be able to buy a machine so that she can have employees and make her business grow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":518196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy tagua to make buttons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariana De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674849},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709034},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892332},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632703},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846749},{"amount":129.13,"local_amount":128.3,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":129.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113269}],"funded_date":"2010-04-09T01:46:52Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":195772,"name":"Srey Pao's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Spean Dek village in Kandal province, six people make up a group loan.

Her husband is Wilfredo, a carpenter, and father to her children. She, together with her husband, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmmie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells barbeque for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmmie hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

This loan is her first with MFP and she will use the money to purchase children's clothing and shoes because they are in the school season. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":280239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-05T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cinthya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":64.7},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":67.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":71.42},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":76.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":79.95},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":82.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":85.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.46},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.81},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.19},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.52},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.65},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.57,"local_amount":64.7,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":70.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117215},{"amount":22.45,"local_amount":67.38,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":73.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012126},{"amount":23.81,"local_amount":71.42,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":77.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595711},{"amount":24.19,"local_amount":72.58,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":79.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989974},{"amount":25.53,"local_amount":76.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211105},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":79.95,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":87.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640607},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":82.13,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080140},{"amount":28.42,"local_amount":85.29,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":92.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996432}],"funded_date":"2009-03-05T19:11:57Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":96608,"name":"Nabi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The agriculture business is one that requires much effort for the simple reason that it requires exposure to the sun, the physical exertion of moving animals from one place to another, as well as the work it takes to tend to various crops. Nabi U.  has dedicated himself for 20 years to cattle raising which supports his humble family who rely on him. Currently Nabi has turned to IMON International for a loan of $1350 USD to purchase calves that he can raise. It\u2019s important to note that the granting of this loan will not only benefit him, but also his children and wife whom he loves greatly.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

G. is 41 and lives with his wife and three daughters in a community called Sa\u00edno de Pital, which is located in the provice of Alajuela.  The main economic activities here are livestock and agriculture, most notably the production of pineapple.  The pineapple is mainly sold to international markets.  For this reason, the development of the community has grown in recent years, generating a larger demand for products and services, which help to mitigate the effect of immigration.  \r\n\r\nSince he was very young, Clover has been dedicated to growing pineapple, so he has quite a bit of experience in caring for and maintaining this type of crop.  He has a small amount of land where he has grown pineapple before, and it has given him good results when it comes time to sell it, which is why he wants to expand his crop.  Thanks to this business, the quality of life of his family has improved considerably.  Clober is requesting a loan of 585,000 colones to purchase pineapple startes and various supplies to give the best maintenance and help possible to his harvest, so in the end he can be rewarded and have a good production.  Clober is a member of the communal bank \"Luz del Futuro Saino,\" one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his second loan and he hopes to grow more on a personal and economic level.  He also stresses that he is thankful to these types of organizations and easier ways to access credit so he can dedicate more time to production activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":370320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"Purchase of supplies for his pineapple crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clober ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":585000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":292500},{"due_date":"2011-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":292500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.52,"local_amount":64652.81,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":64719.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064837},{"amount":389.48,"local_amount":227847.19,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":228080.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831828},{"amount":0.85,"local_amount":496.7,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":497.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189134224},{"amount":499.15,"local_amount":292003.3,"processed_date":"2011-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-21T08:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":292302.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227780094}],"funded_date":"2009-08-17T04:24:03Z","paid_date":"2011-09-21T08:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":133507,"name":"Group Of Love","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Group of Love consists of five borrowers led by Yarkpawolo Z. who live in Borkeza Town, which is near Zorzor, Lofa County, Liberia.

It is comprised of nine members, seven women and two men who work in commerce.  \n\nRaquel C. R., Roberta T. P., and Jose Luis P. C. sell clothes.  Porfirio R. G. and Angel P. F. sell cosmetics and perfumes by catalog.  Araceli P. C. sells shoes by catalog.  Pared Uriel C. G. sells silver in towns bordering his community.  Reyna C. V. makes outfits, blouses, pants, and handicrafts.  Antonia G. M. sells fruit and vegetables, and she will tell us a little about it.\n\nAntonia G. M. is 59 and married.  Her husband works as a taxi driver.  They have a common law marriage.  They have seven children, but none of them live with them.  Their children are all married, and now they are raising their 16 year old grandson.  Their daughter left him when he was one.  Antonia has raised him since then.  She has been part of the Capilla Development Cooperative since it started.  The group has worked with us for six cycles.  She tells us that the group was started by a loan representative who was with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  She had some contacts from Anenecuilco, and she went to visit them.  One of the people she visited was Raquel, who was interested in the project.  She decided to look for other people like Antonia, the Godmother to one of her children.  She invited her and other people, and that is how they started.\n\nThe first loan that Antonia asked for was for $4,000, which she invested in her fruit and vegetable sales.  Then she stopped selling fruits and vegetables and started selling snacks and \u201cdobladas\u201d (folded over tortilla).  That did not go very well for her, and she decided to return to selling fruits and vegetables.  Her current loan is for $3,000.  She did not want more until the crisis we are in improves.  She will use the loan to buy tomatoes, onions, chilies, avocadoes, green beans, apples, bananas, oranges, and vegetable pears to stock her small, great business.  She has a small stand in her house, which is located on the 3 de Mayo street, number 45 in the Capilla Colony in Anenecuilco Morales.  That is where she has her vegetable sales, but she also goes to all of the colonies in Anenecuilco to be able to finish selling her merchandise.\n\nShe tells us that she has experienced many problems like her house being robbed twice while she was out selling.  They took money and appliances, etc.  Even though the neighbors see, they do not say anything.  They keep quiet because, being a town on a hill, they are afraid that the robbers will do something to them afterwards.  At times her husband has not had work either.  They have to find a way to get ahead.  She says that her biggest wish now is that her grandson finish his studies to show his mother that leaving him with his grandmother was worth it.  Antonia says she can do it with the loans, and with her husband\u2019s support.  She will continue until she achieves everything she wants to achieve.\n\nIn the future she hopes to be able to enlarge her business and also sell a few groceries.  They are hardly any of these businesses in her community.\n\nLastly, she thanks the company for giving loans to people who truly need them.  More than anything, they offer the confidence of knowing that they will be paid.  She is grateful to Kiva for associating with the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  It is a very serious, and above all, honorable company.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Maria is requesting the loan so she can invest in her business and thus increase her demand and her family's income. She has had three loans with Kiva partner CEPRODEL and started the business with a small loan and grew it little by little. Maria has three children, only one of whom is still in school and under her care, and it's for this reason she works so hard, so that her son can keep studying.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":485918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase clothing such as pants, blouses, socks, shirts, shoes, among other items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-02-11T02:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4120,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":537.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":553.82},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":570.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":587.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":605.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":623.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":641.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.69},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.26},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.95,"local_amount":452.15,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":459.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128926355},{"amount":24.44,"local_amount":503.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":511.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136653861},{"amount":24.92,"local_amount":513.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":521.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144686528},{"amount":25.44,"local_amount":524.03,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":532.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151870166},{"amount":41.83,"local_amount":861.73,"processed_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-12T07:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":875.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159609747},{"amount":30.26,"local_amount":623.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-19T08:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":633.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166823531},{"amount":31.16,"local_amount":641.99,"processed_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":652.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172090641}],"funded_date":"2010-02-11T17:02:07Z","paid_date":"2010-10-20T08:07:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":179152,"name":"Sumini","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sumini is 46 years of age and married with eight children between the ages of 10 and 30.

Darubba, Quezon,Nueva Vizcaya. She is 44 years old. Gemma is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Gemma owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling gasoline in the local community. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She is single and manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDwighta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also retails mineral water for added income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDwighta hopes to be able to expand soon.

H. is 25 years old, has a secondary school education, is married and has 2 children.  Shodali has been farming for two years just like his father Holmurod H. (another Kiva loan applicant).  He has land where he plants wheat.

She is 46, married, and has five children, ages 28, 24, 20 and 14-year-old twins.  All the children go to school.  Marta finished sixth grade but did not continue because of financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her family and supports a sister who lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Guija for Ndlavela, on the outskirts of the city of Maputo, with her parents when she was very young.  After her marriage, she decided to start a business to help with household expenses.  For more than 14 years, she has been a traveling salesperson.  She has no employees and earns around 6,000 meticais monthy.  She uses this money for household expenses and saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nMarta has never had loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through her brother-in-law, who is also a customer of this institution. This 12,000 meticais loan is her second.  She will use it to buy construction materials (adhesive cement, bricks and other items) to continue construction on her house.  The earlier loan of 8,000 meticais was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out other loans.  In the future, Marta would like to ask for more loans to use for expanding her business and finishing her house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":529757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials (adhesive cement, bricks and other items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-04-29T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":545.03},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":567.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":590.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":615.02},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":640.3},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.61},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":694.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":722.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":752.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":783.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":815.32},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":848.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":883.71},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":920.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":957.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":997.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.23},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.16,"local_amount":1068.49,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1085.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698767},{"amount":1.29,"local_amount":43.97,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":44.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732451},{"amount":317.55,"local_amount":10887.54,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":11057.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916269}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T22:48:37Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":199901,"name":"Batsuuri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batsuuri S. is 61 years old and lives with his wife and two daughters in Arhangai province, Mongolia.
