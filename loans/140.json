She lives together with her children in her own home which is located in the village of Periavente, in Pichari district.\r\n\r\nCenaida has always enjoyed being first.  Her success lies in the good farm management practices that she employs.  She also bears in mind the importance of empathy and this is where she makes her presence felt amongst the middlemen she deals with most frequently.  This means that she enjoys her farm work, producing and selling coffee.  As well as selling her produce at a competitive price, Cenaida has a lot of demand and this makes her good profits.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nGod\u2019s Way High School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

He hopes to buy land for his children so that they do not have difficulties in the future and for them to know how difficult it is to work and so that they become interested in the business which would be a benefit to them and also a way of working.<p>\r\n \r\n\r\nHe purchases and sells large and small livestock.  His business is located in his home.  He has had this business for five years.  Don Carlos started his business with the goal of meeting his household expenses.  It is important to highlight that Don Carlos is a farmer who decided to start in this business since it was not easy to survive the situation with his wife.  Despite this, he resorted to the different regions in search of livestock for sale so that he could make offers to buy.  For this reason, it was not difficult for him to learn this type of business.  He was interested in the selling of pigs which also benefited him.  The financing is for business capital that he needs to buy different animals, cattle as well as pigs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":263752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Business Capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-30T23:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":909.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400035},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092033},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985416},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446031},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956670},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174092},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599707},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035598},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948004},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789978},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":909.1,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":913.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680672}],"funded_date":"2009-01-31T07:10:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joanna Silverman","image":null}},{"id":90754,"name":"Mrs. Tang Kuoy Naing Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The village bank, consisting of nine members, is located in Pech Entrea village in Kampong Chhnang province.

R. is 50 years old and lives in the district of La Esperanza in the province of Trujillo and the department of La Libertad, Peru. She belongs to the community bank Esperanza Unida (United Hope). This businesswoman completed schooling until the 5th year of secondary school when she couldn\u2019t continue studying because at age 17 she got pregnant. Maria Isabel is married, has 3 children and they all depend on her economically because they are in high school. Maria Isabel tends to the telephone booth she has in her house, together with the help of her oldest son. The first loan she received (300 nuevos soles) she invested in building her second telephone stall. She will use this loan of 500 nuevos soles to purchase a photocopier and be able to give this service. Maria Isabel dreams of increasing her telephone booth business with internet, photocopier, typing, and binding services. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":383706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of a photocopier","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-09T17:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":127.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074964},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":127.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990338},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":127.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835322},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":127.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727058}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T18:17:05Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelley Maynard","image":248986}},{"id":139963,"name":"Thi\u00e9bo","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"\nThi\u00e9bo N.  est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 45 ans, elle est restauratrice de cantine scolaire dans une \u00e9cole priv\u00e9e dans la ville de Mbour  et pendant les vacances elle s\u2019active dans le commerce de tissus.

Pinatubo\u2019s spectacular eruption in 1991 destroyed the village of San Roque, among others. Dapdap is located in Central Luzon in Tarlac, a municipality of Bamban Province. Alma is 45 years old, married and has five adult children. Alma owns and runs a general store stocked with a variety of different products which she sells to the local community. She has been in business for over three years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Alma joined ASKI to gain access to its financial services. Alma is requesting a loan from ASKI, her fourth, of 12,000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional products to sell. Alma successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI, also used for the same purpose. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to improve her family\u2019s general living conditions.\r\n<p> \r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nAlalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc., or ASKI, is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and \u2013women, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that one-on-one translations of entrepreneur profiles are costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow it to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":445017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This group is made up of 5 members who know each other.  This is their 12th loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  \r\n\r\nManuela S. S. is a member of the group.  She is 40 years old and completed her education through the 3rd year of secondary school.  She has 3 children: 2 boys and a girl.  Jose David is 11, Juan Diego is 9, and Maria Esther is 7 years old.  She sells pottery.  She will use this loan to stock up on clay and firewood, since these items become scarce during the rainy season.  She works by advance orders, and her customers are from Tlayacapan.  The pieces she makes from clay are pedestals to put flowers on, lamp bases, and large sets of bottles.  She started her business 14 years ago.  She comments that it runs in her family; her father taught her to work with clay.  She is proud of her pottery business, since at times she makes a religious commitment to decorate the church with pedestals for flowers or candelabras for the wax candles on August 24th, when they celebrate Saint Bartolo.  She has had setbacks, such as when the clay fails to resist the fire and the pieces break.  Manuela tells us \"my business is important for me, because with the earnings I am able to cover the household expenses, the educational expenses for my children, and I can continue to buy merchandise in order to keep working.\"  The members of the group are: Petra Constantina V. M., Luisa S. Gonz\u00e1lez, Maura A. V. and Manuela S..

At first she opened a store, utilizing the experience she gained while working at a retail business.  However, all of her customers requested credit, so she was not able to collect payments in a timely fashion as required by her business.  She then decided to sell merchandise to customers who were employed and did very well.  From there she also chose to pursue the activity she enjoys the most and comes to her naturally \u2013 making woven purses and hammocks.  At the same time, Ruby started another business preparing lunches to go because she is a food expert.  She continued to sell clothing and shoes as a necessity because she had established customers and later on added household goods to the inventory of products she offered.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis Kiva loan is the third time she has requested financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With her previous loans, Ruby was able to increase her earnings and pay for her children\u2019s schooling because her greatest dream is to see them work tirelessly until they can finish university.  Her children are very studious and also dream of becoming professionals.  In addition, her loans helped her to acquire tools and equipment to retrofit her food business so that she could expand and diversify her product offering which she has already achieved.  With this loan she plans to buy thread and natural fibers for making purses for which she has received orders.  In addition, she will buy ingredients such as rice, oil, salt, and meat in large volume, as well as a variety of other merchandise.  \r\n<p>\r\nRuby\u2019s biggest challenge is selecting customers who are responsible when purchasing on credit.  Every day she is learning more and gradually controlling the amount of risk she takes by only selling to individuals who are working or have been recommended by her best customers.  Another challenge she faces is paying for her children\u2019s education by herself since she has separated from her husband.  Thanks to God, her efforts have not been fruitless because her children are very aware of her hard work and are taking advantage of the opportunities she has created for them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":608523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Rosa wants to be ready to give her customers everything they need, and for this reason she requests a loan from INTEGRAL which will allow her to purchase staple grains, rice, beans, corn and a large quantity of firewood before the summer ends since prices will go up after that, and thus allow her to benefit.  In this way, Rosa plans to attract new customers and increase her business, which will help to ensure the economic stability of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":768901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy firewood, grains, rice, beans and corn.

The business is stable because Aslan has earned return customers during the time he has run this shop. However, there is no capital to diversify the inventory and increase the turnover, and thereby increase the income to provide all the necessities of life of his children.

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

their lives. This includes the education of their child who is still in primary school.  The income her husband makes as a laborer does not meet all of the needs of their family.  Hence, Ni Ketut Parni operates and manages farmland to increase her family's income.  The main crop in her farmland is cocoa trees, which she still grows using traditional methods without fertilizer or pesticides.  Her production is sufficient to cover her expenses.  However, several months ago her production decreased because of a pest infestation and high rainfall which has prevented the cocoa trees from producing good fruit.  The drop in production along with an increase in the cost of living has hit her family hard.  She isn't able to purchase fertilizer or medicine to cure her plants because she does not have enough capitol.  Due to this lack of funding, she is not able to get her cocoa trees to produce fruit at their maximal rate.  She hopes that a with a loan, she will be able to purchase the fertilizer and plant medicine that will allow her to produce good cocoa fruit again.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lender\/courtenaychris\">Courtenay Teska Race<\/a>, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDalam usia yang masih cukup muda Ni Ketut Parni menunjukkan keuletannya dalam membantu suaminya I Ketut Royen dalam memenuhi segala keperluan hidup mereka, baik itu untuk di dapur maupun biaya-biaya lainnya termasuk biaya pendidikan anaknya yang masih di sekolah dasar.  Penghasilan suaminya yang bekerja sebagai buruh  tidak mampu memenuhi semua kebutuhan keluarga mereka, sehingga Ni Ketut Parni berusaha semaksimal mungkin mengusahakan pengelolaan kebunnya untuk bisa menambah pemasukan keluarganya. \r\nKebun yang dimilikinya dominan dengan tanaman kakao  yang masih dipelihara dangan cara tradisional tanpa penambahan pupuk ataupun  obat-obatan pembasmi hama. Hasil produksi yang diperoleh cukup untuk bisa menutupi pengeluaran-pengeluaran yang ada. Namun dalam beberapa bulan terakhir jumlah produksi tanaman kakaonya menurun  karena serangan hama dan tingginya curah hujan yang menyebabkan tanaman kakaonya tidak bisa memproduksi buah yang bagus sehingga pendapatannya juga jauh berkurang sedangkan biaya hidup semakin bertambah. Untuk pengadaan pupuk ataupun obat pembasmi hama tidak bisa dilakukannya karena terbatasnya modal yang dimiliki, sehingga perawatan atas tanaman kakaonya tidak bisa dilakukan dengan maksimal. Kemudian DINARI memberinya bantuan modal usaha dan itu dimanfaatkannya untuk membeli pupuk dan juga obat pembasmi hama, dengan harapan tanaman kakaonya bisa menghasilkan buah yang baik."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":131601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Cl\u00e9ber has been interested in knitting since he saw his mother making various types of garments when he was young, and it lets him create and develop the whole range of his creativity.  The greatest difficulty in knitting is using the machine as he has to choose all sorts of settings in order to make the sweaters he will later sell in the city\u2019s busiest marketplaces.  \r\n\r\nCl\u00e9ber made all the payments on his first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma on time.

Se dedica principalmente a la comercializaci\u00f3n de animales: todos los mi\u00e9rcoles viaja hacia los caser\u00edos de la zona y compra aves de corral (patos, pavos) que luego vende a los comerciantes de carne del mercado de la ciudad. Ella sacrifica a las aves y las vende listas para ser comercializadas. Este negocio es la principal fuente de ingreso econ\u00f3mico de su familia.\n\nDe otro lado se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de vino. Empez\u00f3 en este negocio hace dos a\u00f1os gracias a que una de sus hijas aprendi\u00f3 el oficio en el colegio donde estudiaba.

Por este motivo se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles.\n\nElla es una madre que siempre da todo de s\u00ed para sacar a sus hijas adelante.

She lives together with her two daughters, 14 and 18, in the San Mart\u00edn sector of the city of Lambayeque, located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nThe separation from her husband motivated her to work to earn the means of support for her daughters.  She is involved mainly in the animal business: every Wednesday she goes to the farmhouses in the area and buys poultry (ducks, turkeys) which she then sells to the meat shopkeepers in the city market.  She sacrifices the birds and sells them ready to be marketed.  This business is the main source of income for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nOn the other side, she is involved in the preparation and sale of wine.  She began this business two years ago thanks to the fact that one of her daughters learned the trade in the high school where she studied.  Marcela ferments the drink in plastic buckets and sells it to her neighbors and acquaintances.\r\n<p>\r\nMarcela wishes to expand her business and enter the goat and sheep market, but she does not have the necessary funds to achieve her goal.  As a result, she has seen it necessary to ask for a loan of 1000 PEN from Edpyme Alternativa for the first time.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a mother that always gives all of herself to help her daughters get ahead.  Her oldest is now studying for a technical degree.  Her biggest wish is to see her two daughters become successful professionals.

She runs a business selling clothing for men, women, and children and also sells Yanbal beauty products and kitchen equipment. A very hard-working woman, Mercedes juggles her time so that she can both work and look after her son who needs so much care. Every morning she gets up and prepares food for him to take to school. She spends the morning travelling around selling her merchandise, and then at midday she meets her son again. There is no one else to help look after him. When she has to go out again in the afternoon, she takes him with her.\r\n \r\nMercedes invests all the money she gets from the Foundation back into her business, in other words into the beauty products that she has to buy on account. She then lets her clients purchase them on credit.  Catalog sales provide good profits, with sales of kitchen appliances being best of all.\r\n\r\nMercedes\u2019 dream is to study to be a nursery school teacher as she loves working with children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mother of five children and has several grandchildren. She lives in the Las Acacias neighbourhood of the Juticalpa municipality.\r\nMrs. M\u00e1xima has a fruit stall in an excellent location on the side of a highly-trafficked road which goes all the way to Tegucigalpa city. There she sells all kinds of fruits, mainly those that are in season. She started her business 14 years ago with another street vendor. She sold cakes, cookies, sweets, etc. But later on, she noticed that these products were not very attractive for the passersby, so she decided to sell fruits. With this loan she will buy a greater quantity of fruits, such as watermelons, oranges, bananas, as well as drinks, cakes, cookies and candies. This will help her to make a better income, allowing her to better sustain her family and cover her youngest child's school costs. One of her challenges has been that one of her grandchildren does not walk or speak, and normally has to be hospitalized. This is very expensive. Her dreams are for her grandchild's health to improve, to have her own big and beautiful establishment, and to have her home--she currently lives in a rented home, and the monthly rent is very high. She has been a FAMA client for six years and she has been able to get ahead and have a better life through these

In her home in the afternoon, she is in charge of getting everything ready so that at 6pm she can begin to sell her delicious and well-cooked plates of roasted chicken.  She has been doing this job for over two years, including its administration.  It is going quite well since their earnings have allowed her to reflect on the difficult times that she has had before and that she has been able to overcome.

There\u2019s money to be made in cacao, and if everything goes perfect and he manages to keep the diseases in check, he says he\u2019ll be a rich man.  \n\nAlfonso is getting ready for cleaning the underbrush surrounding his cacao trees before the upcoming harvest season. Cacao pod production is picking up slowly and will reach full swing in March-April and continue until it slows again In July-August. Cleaning is a routine activity on shade-grown cacao farms in tropical lowlands and needs to be repeated every three to four months. It is necessary to clear access to the trees for pruning, harvesting and or planting new seedlings as well as to prevent fungus diseases common in the rainy season. \n\nAlfonso got introduced to cacao when his father started planting even before the big push in the industry when Hershey\u2019s arrived to Belize in the early 90\u2019s and introduced a new market and seed varietals from Costa Rica. \n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1260173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To hire help with cleaning his 3 plots of cacao in preparation for the upcoming harvest season.

Previously, she used to sell food in the bus station parking lot in Cotonou Porto-Novo Cotonou, the nerve center for travelers.  As a result, the crowds were so big that it had been difficult to meet the ever-demanding customer expectations, due to financial means.  This is why, in order to improve, she came to obtain her first loan of 50,000 francs CFA in 2006.  For her second loan, she obtained 100,000 francs.  Currently, she lives in her father-in-law's house near the DANTOKPA marketplace, opposite the exposed gutter, where she switched to selling beverages (products of the B\u00e9ninoise de Brasserie Company), imported beverages, and charcoal.  She started this business about four years ago.  The demand is growing so much that, at midday, she no longer has anything for the numerous customers lining up in front of her shop.  To be able to get supplies in sufficient quantities and to meet the demand without fail, she is requesting a fourth loan of 250,000 francs.  She is aiming at devoting 2\/3 of these fund to buying beverages and the rest for buying charcoal.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e vers les ann\u00e9es 1959 \u00e0 OUIDAH dans le d\u00e9partement de l'Atlantique au sud du B\u00e9nin, dame W.

J. is a hardworking young gentleman who works in the cattle raising business. He is married and provides for his little son. He works hard to provide everything his family needs. Presently, Sadullo is making sacrifices and working hard to make his business grow. For that he is requesting a loan that will allow him to purchase baby cows with the purpose of feeding them and raising them. His goal is to then be able to get the most return from the sale of milk products. This will be his first loan with IMON and Kiva, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He works hard at raising cattle, which he takes out to graze in the early mornings. Without a doubt it is not an easy task, but the love for his family gives his work reason and meaning.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lupe's goal is to continue increasing her business and to improve her income. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":470677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"She will use her loan to repair her car to rent it out and in selling goods for the school season ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":413.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954441},{"amount":145,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":413.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987465},{"amount":145,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":413.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713484},{"amount":145,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":413.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746550},{"amount":145,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":413.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929755}],"funded_date":"2010-02-08T17:48:30Z","paid_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":173052,"name":"Elsa Lucia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elsa tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad ella es soltera vive  en la casa de sus padres juntamente con sus hermanos ellos viven  en el Asentamiento Humano Micaela Bastidas  en casa de 1 piso de material  noble, ella se dedica a la venta de productos de belleza y la venta de bebidas en la casa de sus padres, Elsa es una joven muy activa con muchas metas y objetivos uno de ellos es poder crecer en su negocio, con el dinero que solicita  invertira en capital de trabajo de la venta de productos de belleza.","en":"Elsa is 23 years old, single, and lives in her parent\u2019s house along with her brothers.

She is 39 years old. Liza is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Liza raises livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Liza has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Liza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Liza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Liza is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Liza from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in her own house together with her two beloved daughters, Yoselin who is 14 and Lisbeth who is 12 years old, and to whom she wants to offer a better quality of life.  In the comfort of her home, Margarita weaves colored handcrafted garments by hand.  Every day she starts working very early, since she has to complete the orders that her buyers make.  She not only sells what she weaves, but also she collects garments from other weavers, who also receive a good payment for their work.  What she likes most about her work, is that she also helps her coworkers get ahead.  She has been doing this work for 15 years, and what she considers most difficult is to be able to wake up early in order to complete the orders.  In the future, she hopes to form a business with her weaving colleagues, so that they can all develop themselves.  This is her fourth loan with MFP, in her previous payments she was always very punctual and she expects to be so now also.

She recognizes that this work requires a lot of effort, so when harvest time comes she has to hire laborers to facilitate the harvest of this produce.  What she most longs for is to have capital to invest in her farm, and with the same desire and enthusiasm that characterize her, she wants to improve her cultivation methods to have a better harvest of coffee and cacao.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she promises to be punctual in her payments.  With the 3,000 soles she is asking for, she will purchase sacks of organic fertilizer to fertilize her fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":822783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Froilana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3009.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201847}],"funded_date":"2011-07-26T23:03:26Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":325191,"name":"Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n    La se\u00f1ora Catalina, es casada con el se\u00f1or Harvey,  en donde procreo cuatro  hijos quienes  dos ya est\u00e1n casados y dos siguen a su responsabilidad y son: Mirna Fabiola de quince a\u00f1os  de edad y la m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a es Liliana Montserrat dieseis a\u00f1os de edad. \n\n    Ella es ama de casa y se dedica a la compra de pollos de granja para luego venderlo ali\u00f1ado o en pie, y solicito el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s pollos por reja, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n comprar pollos de rancho para venderlo rostizado.\n\n     Quien lo inspiro en esta actividad fue su familia para que tambi\u00e9n ella aporte con los ingresos de la casa aun que cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo  decidi\u00f3 trabajar para as\u00ed sacara adelante  a sus hijos que est\u00e1n estudiando.\n\n    Lo que m\u00e1s desea es que con esta peque\u00f1a actividad pueda seguir adelante mejorando su calidad de vida y teniendo ahorros para sostener a su familia que es lo m\u00e1s importante para ella.\n","en":"Sra.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

ketrampilan yang sangat berharga dari orang tuanya . Sejak masih muda Bapak dari dua orang anak ini kini meneruskan bahkan mengembangkan ketrampilan yang di perolehnya dari turun temurun .Ketrampilan itu adalah membuat Sanggah Yang dalam Umat Hindu bangunan sanggah ini merupakan sejenis Pura Yang terbuat dari Kayu dengan ukuran yang sudah baku yang di letakkan di depan rumah sebagai tempat untuk melakukan Persembahan (sesajen) bagi pemeluk agama Hindu. Dalam pengerjaan sanggah ini memerlukan ketrampilan khusus dan harus dikerjakan oleh orang yang sudah terbiasa seperti halnya dengan I Nengah Dwikayama\nIstri dari I Komang Sulasmi ini dalam mengerjakan sebuah sanggah memerlukan waktu kurang lebih satu Minggu, dengan modal bahan (kayu dan alat2 lainya ) berkisar Rp 1.250.000-sd 1.500.000,- tergantung jenis kayu yang di minta oleh pemesan. Sedangkan harga sebuah sanggah saat ini Rp 2.000.000-  . Jadi dalam seminggu pendapatan yang di peroleh I Nengah Dwikayama sebesar Rp 500.000-750.000. Namun begitu I Nengah Dwikayama merasa sangat kawalahan dalam menerima order , hal ini disebabkan oleh karena tidak tersedianya  modal yang cukup untuk membeli bahan baku, khususnya Kayu yang kini semakin sulit di dapat dan harganyapun mahal.\nUntuk menunjang usahanya itu I Nengah Dwikayama ingin mendapat tambahan modal dari DINARI yang akan dipergunakan untuk membeli kayu untuk stok , sehingga pada saat ada order I Nengah Dwikayama bisa cepat mengerjakannya.\nDengan tambahan modal ini I Nengah Dwikayama optimis hasil yang di dapat akan lebih baik sehingga mampu menunjang biaya pendidikan kedua Orang anaknya Yang kini telah duduk di bangku SMA.          . \n","en":"I Nengah Dwikayama is coming from a family of carpenters. From his early age he is already in the business of wood carpentry. He is now a master in making Sanggah, a wooden Pura (Pura is a temple in Hindu faith used to place the offerings). <p>\r\nI Nengah Dwikayama and his wife can build one Sanggah in a week time. They needs woods for the material that usually cost them around USD 130, depending on the type and the quality of the wood. They can sell one Sanggah for around USD 172. So they can earn a net profit of USD 40 per Sanggah sold. <p>\r\nAt the moment he is having difficulties in receiving orders from customers. Sometimes he doesn't have enough money to buy the woods to build Sanggahs when he has a lot of orders. Therefore he applies for a loan from DINARI so he can get an additional working capital.<p>\r\nHe is hoping with more capital he can meet more orders from the customers. With this he can have more income to support his two children who are studying at High School.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva

For the past fifteen years, she has run a clothing stand where she sells clothing materials, lace and slippers. When the pace of business slowed, she opened a grocery shop in front of her house where she sells items like milk, sugar, canned tomatoes, flour etc.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Unfortunately, she has insufficient working capital to run her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":345940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing of a woodworker for the manufacturing.

needs vegetables. Nuriddin has been selling fruits and vegetables in Dushanbe city for the past three years.\r\n\r\nNuriddin began his own stall with his hard-earned savings as he had always wanted to be an entrepreneur. He began selling in \u201cGanj\u201d market with very little stock to offer his clients. Slowly he began to increase the goods offered until he managed to get a permanent market stall. Currently his stall is his pride and joy with a zinc roof and ceramic tiles on the floor.\r\n\r\nNuriddin is the father of three children who are in school. As any father, he is doing his best in order to ensure his children have the best future and to make them well-educated.\r\n\r\nNow, Nuriddin needs a loan of 5,000 Somoni in order to increase the range of his stock. He expresses his gratitude to everyone supporting him.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crab products in the local community.

Laurencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Laurencia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Laurencia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>About GDMPC: <\/b> <\/p>\r\n<p>GDMPC is one of the most

dedicado al trabajo arduo, cultivando hortalizas en chacras arrendadas y algunas veces parte del costo de arrendamiento lo hace con la producci\u00f3n de sus cultivos. \nAhora sus hijos la apoyan en esta actividad, sin embargo la necesidad apremia, ya que ellos desean estudiar y para cubrir esa necesidad Isidora tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta de carne de carnero y cerdo en el mercado mayorista de la ciudad. \nEs as\u00ed que los d\u00edas jueves y domingos, est\u00e1 en la feria vendiendo carne, y esta actividad le produce los ingresos necesarios para solventar los gastos de movilidad diaria de sus hijos. \nPero a Isidora lo que m\u00e1s le satisface es el trabajo en el campo, una vez obtenida la producci\u00f3n de sus hortalizas las vende de manera r\u00e1pida por lo que le resulta rentable. Lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de esta labor es lavar las espinacas para luego ser puestas en canastas y enviadas a uno de los mercados de la ciudad Lima, donde recibe un bien precio por sus productos, y eso la motiva a seguir cultivando espinacas.\n\nEste es su s\u00e9ptimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y durante los cr\u00e9ditos anteriores ha sido puntual en sus pagos. Asimismo, es muy responsable, cumpliendo con su cargo de tesorera dentro de su banco comunal. El dinero que ahora solicita es para invertirlo en la compra fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos para aplicar a sus cultivos de espinacas, pues se acerca la temporada de siembra. \n","en":"At age 45, Isidora is a talkative and very happy woman.  She is a single mother of 4 children and they live together in a rented house.  \r\n\r\nIsidora is both father and mother for her children, which is why she is dedicated to her arduous work cultivating vegetables in small leased farms.  Sometimes she pays part of the cost of leasing with the crops she produces.  Now her children help her in this activity.  Nevertheless she feels pressured because they want to go to school.  To cover that need Isidora is also involved in selling mutton and pork in the wholesale market of the city.  On Thursday and Sundays, she is in the market selling meat, and this activity produces for her the necessary income to settle the expenses of daily transportation for her children.  But to Isidora what she finds most satisfying is the work in the country.  Once she has harvested her vegetables she sells them quickly which turns out to be profitable for her.  The most difficult part of this work is to wash the spinach in order to put it in baskets and take it to one of the markets of Lima, where she receives a good price for her products, and that motivates her to continue cultivating spinach.  \r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  During the previous loans she has been punctual in her payments.  Likewise, she is very responsible, fulfilling her role of treasurer of her communal bank.  The money that she now requests is to be invested in the purchase of chemical fertilizer to apply to her spinach crop, as the season to sow a new crop approaches. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":425764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for her spinach crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-15T15:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isidora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2009,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886551}],"funded_date":"2009-11-15T18:02:19Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":156536,"name":"Abraham","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Abraham es un hombre trabajador de 60 a\u00f1os, vive solo en la casa que con tanto trabajo logr\u00f3 edificar.\n\n\u00c9l se dedica, justamente a eso, a la construcci\u00f3n de casas, desde que era peque\u00f1o su padre le ense\u00f1\u00f3 esta labor y todos los secretos para lograr una buena edificaci\u00f3n y con el pasar del tiempo, la experiencia le hizo ser experto y ahora puede leer planos y trabajar por contrato.\nA Abraham le gusta mucho su trabajo y todos estos a\u00f1os lo ha realizado con mucha alegr\u00eda y orgullo, pero sabe que no podr\u00e1 estar en esta actividad para siempre, es por ello que para el futuro ha pensado implementar una ferreter\u00eda, pues es un negocio m\u00e1s estable y tranquilo que podr\u00e1 administrar desde su casa. \n\nEste es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y siempre se ha caracterizado por ser una persona muy responsable y puntual con el pago de sus cuotas.

They live in the South Pelengana area of the city of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nThey know each other through marriage, community, and professional relations.\r\nThis group of women runs businesses selling various items (cosmetics, pagnes - a type of brightly-printed West African cloth, incense, embroidered fabric, plastic footwear, etc.)\r\nIt is with the hope of satisfying their clientele that they decided to join the loan program of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso (one of Kiva's field partners), with whom they are on their 3rd solidarity (group) loan, after having repaid their two previous loans.\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy 3 sets of pagnes wax, 5 sets of embroidered clothing, 60 boxes of creams and ointments for skin and hair, 25 kg of \"gueni\" (a fragrant root), 3 bottles of eau de Cologne, 10 bottles of perfume, and 24 empty bottles in which to put incense for sale.\r\nThey get their supplies of embroidered clothing in Burkina Faso,their pagnes wax and ingredients to prepare incense at the grand market in S\u00e9gou, and buy their creams and ointments in Bamako.\r\nTo make their incense, they lightly grind the \"gueni\", then hand-pick and submerge it in eau de Cologne in a vase that they seal hermetically for a month, after which time they add a sufficient quantity of perfume and mix it well before putting it in boxes for sale.\r\nThe clothes are re-sold in Dioro, Markala, and the city of S\u00e9gou, while the creams, ointments, and incense are re-sold at home or door-to-door in the area.\r\nThe sales are generally made in cash and on credit to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\nThey hope to realize an average monthly profit of 21,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan from Soro Yiriwaso, provide for social and family occasions (marriages, baptisms, circumcisions, and funerals), increase savings, and take care of certain family expenses.\r\nTheir ambition is to own individual businesses and become wholesalers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

She is 59 years old. Mila is widowed and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Mila owns & operates a specialized retail store where she sells different goods like vegetables, eggs and more in the local community. Mila has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mila joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Mila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Mila is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Mila from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":491031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives in Proper, Brgy. Dungga, Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,400. Emerenciana is now borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional working capital.  This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Emerenciana hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

He is married and supports his wife and four children. \r\n<p>\r\nA livestock breeder for five years, Jamshed is very dynamic, serious, and entrepreneurial. He is proposing to expand his herd and repair his enclosure so as to meet the needs of a rather large clientele from his village and the surrounding neighborhood. Some buyers come from more than twenty kilometers from his village. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this goal in mind, Jamshed is requesting a loan that will serve as business capital. The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and also make some investments. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan: \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich place in history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the farthest reach of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services.

To overcome this problem, he established a chicken-breeding business which has been running for three years. He had 300 chicks to raise in his chicken pen but  many died due to the poor, small cage. Some died because they were trampled by other chickens. He desires to improve his business in order to generate better income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is a single parent with one child who is now studying in college. She, together with her child, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAlicia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked viands in her store. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 27,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlicia hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her child a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Con el \u00e1nimo de seguir adelante con sus vacas, Diana aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una vaca lechera la cual le genere mayores ingresos para su hogar.\nDiana espera que de esta manera sus ingresos mensuales no se vean afectados por la compra de la vaca y pueda tener mejores ingresos para ofrecer a sus padres mejor calidad de vida y para poder progresar econ\u00f3micamente. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1011089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de una vaca lechera la cual le genere mayores ingresos para su hogar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Sofia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89095},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91610},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94196},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96855},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99589},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102400},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":105290},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":108262},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":111318},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":114460},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117691},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":121013},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":124429},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":127941},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":131553},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":135266},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":139084},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143010},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147047},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":151198},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":155466},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":159854},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":164366},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":169007}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":993955,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is taking another loan because his 1st Kiva loan played an instrumental role in his business.

Peru\u2019s national dish, consists of fresh fish, lime, and spices, and anyone who is planning to prepare this delicious and healthy meal can stop by Sonia\u2019s stand in the fish market to buy all the necessary ingredients in one trip. Located just inside the door of the local fish market in Ayacucho, Per\u00fa, Sonia provides the lime, onions, tomatoes, spices, lettuce, chilies, and everything else used to prepare both ceviche and fried fish, another Peruvian favorite. Her clients consist of everyone from mothers shopping for the day\u2019s meal to large seafood restaurants. Every single day of the week, one can find Sonia at her stand, with her busiest days being Saturday and Sunday when the largest shipments of fish arrive from the coastal capital of Lima. <P>\r\n\r\nAlthough she loves ceviche and loves her job, Sonia\u2019s aspirations lie in a different field. One day, she says she would love to open a store specializing in spices. There is much more demand and the prices are higher in this market, she explains. The larger profit potential would be especially welcome in Sonia\u2019s household these days as she has two little daughters ages 3 and 4. Everything she does is for her daughters and she works and saves diligently to be able to provide a better life for the two of them. <P>\r\n\r\nSonia\u2019s participation in her village bank is what has helped her grow her business and earn capital for the past 4 years, as she works towards the many goals she has set for herself and her business. She says she loves to be involved because her village bank has taught her how to save her money in the bank where it safely accumulates interest. There she has also learned the value of punctuality and responsibility. Sonia is currently requesting a loan of US$ 425. This money she will invest in a car which will greatly help her in the purchase and shipment of the products she sells daily."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":88326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To invest in a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-25T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-09T03:27:06Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-01-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112783},{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-02-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132131},{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-03-09T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153930},{"amount":104,"local_amount":293.65,"processed_date":"2008-04-09T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":310.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178115}],"funded_date":"2007-11-25T03:27:06Z","paid_date":"2008-04-09T09:13:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":29355,"name":"Umarboi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Umarboi U. lives in B.Gafurov Rayon; he is divorced and has 2 children.

After his military retirement, Boubou D. is returning to one of his money-making businesses, poultry-farming, which he learned from a friend for over two years. With the intention of growing his business, he decided to join microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso who has just granted him his first loan. He plans to buy 200 chicks, 8 feeding troughs, 8 drinking troughs, 2 boxes of vaccines, 20 bags of vitamins, and 1400 kilograms of feed. He gets his supplies from Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali.

The children's father abandoned the family many years ago, and now she lives with her new partner, Omar, with whom she also had a child, but sadly the baby died shortly after. It was a Thursday morning and like always she left to sell pineapple slices and tamales from her basket, not knowing that her son would fall into the river. After many days of looking, the body was found, and Giovana wanted to day and not work anymore. But she still had her other two children, and for them she tried to resume her activities. In the morning, she prepares their breakfast and lunch before leaving to sell her foods to drivers passing by. She really enjoys the activity, even though she says there's a lot of competition and sometimes she has trouble selling all of her tamales, which she then keeps for herself, and her earnings drop. After the hardship she endured, she tries to stay strong and work for her children. With the loan she is requesting, she will invest in the purchase of pineapples and other fruits to open a juice stand at a small rented storefront.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":215363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Start a juice stand business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-26T04:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-09T12:42:55Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957455},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227705},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422940},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116164},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011124},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:59Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594727},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989246},{"amount":34.39,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":104.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210579}],"funded_date":"2008-10-26T11:42:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":74434,"name":"Mrs. Oun Chhoen Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank consisting of sixteen people is located in Kandal Kraom village in Kandal Province.

Thanks to the house she was able to acquire 10 years ago she can provide her family with comfort and security.  She is very well known for her ambition within the area where she lives, as she can be seen every afternoon leaving with her food cart that she moves from her house to the corner where she attends to customers from 6:00 pm until very late at night.  She works selling her delicious hamburgers at a reasonable price in order to attract the clientele to guarantee that her business grows.  Even though sales have been increasing, Ylicia is planning to open a bookstore in her home, and counts on her husband's support, as he is investing in her business.  However, they still have not collected enough money to buy the furniture and merchandise, making it necessary that she keep working selling food until they have the needed capital for their future business.  This is her first loan with MFP, and the money will be used to buy merchandise for her upcoming bookstore, in which she has placed all her hopes and desires of having a stable business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":306855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Merchandise to start a bookstore","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ylcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.37},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.68},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.74},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":157.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":163.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":173.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.95},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":125.37,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":128.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596094},{"amount":43.89,"local_amount":131.68,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":135.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990358},{"amount":45.97,"local_amount":137.91,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":141.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211482},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":142.74,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":146.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640987},{"amount":48.49,"local_amount":145.46,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":149.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080453},{"amount":50.95,"local_amount":152.84,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:04Z","rounded_local_amount":157.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996612},{"amount":52.46,"local_amount":157.39,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":161.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842128},{"amount":168.87,"local_amount":506.61,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":520.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733791}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T22:41:47Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":107202,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene D. lives in Lower Lamac, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental.

","en":"Godefroid K. sells various goods, such as soap, canned foods, sugar, vegetable oil, school supplies, etc... in Kingasani, which is located on the north side of the city of Kinshasa and its most populated part.  He started the business by selling sweet beverages in 2001 with $20 in initial capital.  From 2001-2005, it was prosperous, enabling him to open a small general store. Through decisive effort and accumulated profits, he was able to amass $250 of working capital this year. \r\n\r\nGodefroid intends to use the loan of this May to buy merchandise to bolster his inventory in order to satisfy the needs of his customers for sugar and lollipops.  He's running into difficulties due to electric power outages occurring at awkward moments.  But he uses blocks of ice to cool his drinks just the way his customers like it.  Currently, his business produces $144 in profits a month.  He hopes to make more than that in the near future because his ambition is to open a cold room to store fresh foodstuff for customers with the goal of growing his revenues. \r\n\r\nGodefroid has been a member of a HOPE RDC group named \"La Rose\" since 2008.  He is 42 years old, married, and the father of four children, ranging in age from 2 to 12.

She is 43 years old. Wilfreda is widowed and has four adult children. To make a living, Wilfreda owns & operates a business where she sells bananas and vegetables. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling bananas and vegetables in the local community. Wilfreda has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wilfreda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wilfreda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Wilfreda is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Wilfreda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives with her husband in Siem Reap province. She owns a business producing Cambodian traditional cakes, typically earning $1 per day. Her husband\u2019s business is the primary source of income for her family. He is a construction worker, typically earning $4 per day.\r\n\r\nThe financial crisis has been difficult for businesses in Cambodia this past year. This factor has played into a difficult economic year for many, S. included. The country's economic struggles always seem to affect the poor the most.

24-year-old high-school graduate preparing for university. Ayoubah cares for his two younger brothers. He lives and works on Randall Street, a district in downtown Monrovia, Liberia. Randall Street is a very popular street when it comes to business.\r\n\r\nAyoubah's business is in selling building materials. He buys these materials in wholesale and sells in retail to people who work in small construction. He started this business six years ago and is doing well, but shortage of goods on the market makes business difficult for Ayoubah.\r\n\r\nAyoubah is proud of the quality goods he supplies to his customers. He hopes eventually to own a big construction store and to become a successful businessman. He is requesting this loan to purchase more building materials in order to acquire more of a profit. His dream is to achieve a better level of education and to provide a good future for the children he will someday have."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":394835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

She has been engaged in her fishing business for more than ten years and also gets involved in bamboo set making as another source of household income.\r\n\r\nShe plans to utilize this loan of 10,000 PHP to expand her fishing business and to continue to be involved in other businesses for supplementary profits. This loan will be used to buy secondhand fish cages, bamboo and fingerlings (small fish). She believes that her business will help her family to rise up and fight against poverty.\r\n\r\nDuring her one year as a member of ASHI, Pacita has shown very good performance with her group mates and at the center. Having this loan will enable her to finally achieve her dreams in life: to have a successful business, a better life and a happy family as well. She is very thankful to ASHI and KIVA services for the continued support of her

because it was fun. It just came easy to me.\u201d  \r\n\r\nCombining a natural talent with metal, an eye for design, and his enthusiasm for off-road vehicles, Joey opened his own custom welding and metals fabrication shop, Infamous Metal Works. \r\n \r\nOver the past several years, Joey has built a dedicated client base, first by taking on side-work for customers while working at a metal fabrication shop, and now through his own business. These loyal customers, now friends, strongly encouraged Joey to start his business when the opportunity presented itself in 2007. Their support, as well as the customer referrals they send, has been critical over the past two years, and Joey has built up a brand name for himself without putting much effort into marketing. \r\n \r\nIn the next year, he would like to increase sales through his website and to hire another employee to help him and his two part-time workers to manage the increasing work load. \r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I could say that I make my own schedule, but I\u2019m here 10-14 hours a day, 7 days a week. There\u2019s always something to do, whether it\u2019s helping customers, ordering parts, or setting up the machines.\u201d \r\n \r\nA $10,000 loan will allow Joey to purchase a steel-cutting machine that will expand his design capabilities and attract new customers. \r\n\r\n\u201cI can design a part on my computer, and then use the machine to cut it into the steel. It will open a lot of doors to grow my business.\u201d

She is 55 years old. Rita is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRita is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Rita owns & operates a business selling fish in the local community. Rita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Rita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital. Rita is requesting a new loan of 10,500 PHP, which will be used as additional capital in expanding the business. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Rita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the living standard of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Salima is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera, in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.  Salima has a business managing a small retail shop in Kyotera.  Despite her very young age, Salima has had her business for about three years.    \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Salima is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more inventory, which Salima will be able to sell at her retail shop. She hopes to create a strong business and to save profits in order to support herself in the future.    \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva, which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access financing at a young age and to improve their prospects for the future. It is targeting a segment of the population that is not typically served by traditional microfinance organizations. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans. It gives Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and to support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

He owns a grocery store and has been in the business for 3 years.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Luis set up his business with his own capital and gradually stocked his store.  He was 25 when he started the business, having previously been employed as a worker in a company.  Jos\u00e9 Luis' wife helps him to serve in the business.  They provide their services to people who work in the local cigar factory and support each other in serving the customers.  They have hopes that their business will prosper and gain a better inventory of products that people regularly buy.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Luis is requesting this loan so that he can buy essential food products such as meat, basic grains, bread and vegetables.  He thereby hopes to increase his number of customers and also his sales.  One of his future plans is to convert his business into a mini-supermarket that sells all kinds of products.  His next goal is to save enough money so that he can pay for his [9-year-old] eldest daughter's medical treatment and continue to invest in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":728108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She began working in her house where she would meet her clients with an enormous and happy smile making them feel comfortable while they wait to be attended to. Janixi began when she was seventeen years old and since then she has liked embellishing people. From the outset she has counted on the support of her mother who has been her greatest strength and raised her alone. Previously Janixi sold cosmetics and clothing with her mother and even today she sells beauty products and cosmetics in her salon.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
