She has two higher education degrees and two specialties - as an accountant and a pedagogue-historian-lawyer. Now she works in a school as a teacher of the history of Armenia. She is 45 years old and during these years she had to pass and still passes through many hardships alone and with great efforts. \n\nNeither Kiva lenders nor anyone else who may read this woman\u2019s profile description can remain indifferent to her suffering and difficult life story. She lost her first child when he was just new-born baby as the result of doctors\u2019 incompetent and incorrect actions. Her second son was born with an innate disease of renal failure. Now he is 11 years old and he is in a very weak and bad condition. He does not walk and can do nothing without his mother\u2019s help. The care of this boy demands great costs and as Zaruhi says, there is nobody left whom she can ask for financial support. We are talking about a large amount of money. \n\nHer son needs an urgent kidney transplant since day-by-day he becomes weaker and looses hope. \n\nIn Armenia such operations are done on a very low level, since the medical equipment is far from being effective and modern. For people having such a disease, dialysis somehow lightens the problem, but in our country even this is in a very low level and now Zarui and her son are in a very desperate state. \n\nZaruhi does the impossible to keep alive her son with the help of very expensive medicines and injections and she is taking this loan amount for the purchase of just some part of these medicines.\n \nZaruhi dreams of a day that miraculously her son will manage to go to France and get registered for surgery and become a cheerful, active and healthy boy.\n\nZaruhi greatly thanks Kiva and the kind and generous lenders, and Nor Horizon and says God bless all of the children of the world, and let them all be healthy and happy.

In order to feed his family, he also operates his own business. Erkinchon farms and raises livestock. He has a plot of land. Some of it is watered by rain, and the rest is irrigated. On this land, Erkinchon grows crops. His wife helps him take care of and raise cattle. Since they have a large plot of land, they also use it for cattle grazing. The livestock business brings him a good income, so Erkinchon wants to expand the business by increasing the amount of cattle in his herd. For this, he has turned to Avrand to request a loan for the purchase of cattle. Erkinchon hopes for a positive result, and thanks Avrand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1564599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-15T17:10:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-15T17:10:24Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erkinchon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":443.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":458.43},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":473.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":490.04},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":506.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":523.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":541.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":562.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4105.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875680}],"funded_date":"2014-05-15T15:55:21Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":694319,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is a married  woman; she lives at a rental house that has electricity but not piped water.

She bought a nice aluminum cupboard, a place where she keeps chips after being fried, and a fridge to keep soft drinks. Rukia is doing great and is thankful to everyone who has supported her group. Rukia received increased income, which she used to buy a plot of land and build a house. She covered part of school fees and household expenses. With the loan, Rukia will open a barbershop business. In this new business,Rukia will employ somebody in full time but she will be supervising. She dreams of owning a car and improving her family life. \n\nRukia will share this loan with her loan group\" ROYAL GROUP\" which totals four members.

He's single and has no children, and is currently staying in his uncle's house. Jose is a mason and says he has vast experience in the field of masonry, stating that he's been doing this work for ten years and builds houses, floors, walls, etc. He says that it's a job that generates a good income, and that's why he decided to take up this line of work and he currently has lots of clients. He leaves home to do the jobs as it's always necessary to travel to other locations to work. Jose learned how to be a mason as his uncle's apprentice and also works in agriculture planting staple foods like corn and beans. He'll use the loan to invest in the house he's building, and it's almost finished. Specifically, he will buy 15 sheets of metal and 500 clay tiles for the roof and walls since building his own home has been a life goal and God willing he's accomplishing it with hard work and effort. In the future Jose plans to improve his house, using cement and cinder blocks for its construction, as well as get married and have children with his wife, and have a better job to make life easier and generate more income for his future family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1578292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 15 sheets of metal and 500 clay tiles for a roof, because building his own house has been one of his life goals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-15T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-15T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":47.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":58.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":72.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.25},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.66},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.12},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.21},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.66},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manolo Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":693947,"name":"Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos es una mujer de 60 a\u00f1os de edad, no sabe leer ni escribir por lo dif\u00edcil de la vida y la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en aquel tiempo que pasaba su familia cuando ella era peque\u00f1a no logro que sus padres la pusieran estudiar para  aprender a leer y a escribir.

She never learned how to read or write because life was hard for her family when she was little. Due to their financial situation her parents weren't able to send her to school to learn how to read and write. Santos says illiteracy has made her life a bit more complicated. She is a single mother of ten children. Six of them live with their partners and the rest still live at home with her and work as farmers growing basic grains. Only these four children and herself live in Santos' house.\r\n\r\nSantos works as a homemaker. She says she has been doing this ever since she was a child. Her mother taught her how to take care of her household and do all the chores, which for her is very productive. She was able to raise her ten children because she has a lot of experience and she still now takes care of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan she is requesting from CREDICAMPO to consolidate some pending debts she has. She wants to be rid of them and be left with only one debt. The rest of the loan is to buy 200 clay tile shingles for the roof of her house, which is somewhat in disrepair, particularly since the rainy season is approaching. Santos needs to repair her roof for the winter so that it is ready in time.\r\n\r\nSantos wants lots of wellbeing for herself and her family.

She has one son and two daughters. Her husband works as a repairman for cycles, motorcycles and tractors. He has become an expert and known by many in the area for his expertise. Rajiya borrowed money from MESP to start a poultry shop where she buys hens from firms and sells them to local residents. She invested a part of the money to open a repair shop for her husband next to her poultry shop. She earns around Rs 100 \u2013 150 from the poultry and he earns around Rs 200 \u2013 250 per day.\r\n\r\nRiver Ajoy cuts the village from Deoghar and in the past there was no road as well.

Her husband has been running a general store in which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap, biscuits, etc. \r\n\r\nHe manages his household necessities from his own store as well. Some of his relatives like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with a monotonous tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up a very good relationship with his customers. \r\n\r\nHis general store is very famous in the town; that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relationships, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Humaira requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soap, shampoo, detergents, biscuits, etc. \r\n\r\nHumaira hopes that her husband will utilize the loan in a positive way; this amount will help him to cope with the demand. \r\n\r\nShe thanks Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

He wants to study so that he can become a person who can offer positive things to society.  Andr\u00e9s believes that it is important to have a firm and solid foundation with a degree so that one can be adaptable.  He needs to strengthen himself in his studies so that he can be responsible as he accomplishes all of his goals.  Andr\u00e9s is positive that if he pursues a career that has all the necessary qualities that he is looking for, then he will be able to accomplish one of his most important goals in life.  <br \/><br \/>Andr\u00e9s believes that one career path that can offer him what he looking to achieve in life is the hospitality industry.  It has all the qualities that interest him, such as the opportunities that are offered to both foreigners and locals, as well as the advantages and delights of working within his own country.  He is also very interested in being open to the option of having opportunities abroad in which a degree could lead to different types of fields.  <br \/><br \/>Andr\u00e9s Felipe believes that CampoAlto is an institution that offers a wide variety of interesting programs in which its students can develop.  In addition to the academic opportunities that are provided, he also wants to make progress in life.  He says that he mentors other young men who want to prepare themselves, nurtures them with great warmth, and supports them as they accomplish their goals.  <br \/><br \/>Andr\u00e9s is very interested in studying at CampoAlto because the professors are all members of the institute.

help of his wife Majory and their two daughters. His business is located in Luanshya, a town in the Copperbelt province of Zambia.\r\n\r\nDominic would like to take this opportunity to thank the Kiva lenders. With their support, he has been able to open a new outlet in Luanshya and bring new customers on board. Dominic says even though working capital still remains a huge challenge, he is happy with the growth he has seen in his business. He used the proceeds from his loans to purchase a new fridge for his perishable goods, add to his working capital, and make infrastructure improvements to his shop location. He says paying for his children\u2019s school fees has become much easier because of his increased revenue. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan that Dominic is taking out from Kiva.

is 51 years old and she is the mother of six sons and three daughters living in Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband has been running a general store in which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap, biscuits, etc. He manages his household necessities from his store. As well, some of his relatives like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with a monotonous tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behaviour and tone, he has built up a very good relationship with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town and that is the reason that his business is running well. Due to these good relations, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Bashiran has requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses (edible seeds), soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits, etc. Bashiran thanks Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan. Bashiran hopes that her husband will utilize the loan in a positive way; this amount will help him to cope with the

For this reason, she made the decision to request this loan from FUSAI in order to invest in her business and buy the necessary raw materials, such as wood, adhesive, paint, varnish, and nails.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to be able to increase her sales and her earnings so that she can improve her living conditions and those of her beloved son. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1579297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy wood, adhesive, paint, varnish, and nails","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-04-16T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-16T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":43.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":49.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":53.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":57.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.4,"local_amount":43.4,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-18T08:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479371710},{"amount":44.92,"local_amount":44.92,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-19T09:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":44.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491254503},{"amount":46.49,"local_amount":46.49,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":46.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504170116},{"amount":110.91,"local_amount":110.91,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":110.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519529551},{"amount":38.56,"local_amount":38.56,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-19T09:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":38.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":543042984},{"amount":53.35,"local_amount":53.35,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":53.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562331702},{"amount":55.22,"local_amount":55.22,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":55.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579476926},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":57.15,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":57.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595083171}],"funded_date":"2014-04-16T11:53:40Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:05:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Minogue","image":null}},{"id":697568,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is married with two children, both of whom go to school.

He is a civil servant. Both he and his wife practice farming. They have been farming for ten years now and are currently growing tea and maize and rearing dairy cattle in their farm.

The representative of the group, Catherine (whose hand is raised in the photo) is 38 years old and has never attended school. She is married to a driver named Amos. The couple has four children, who all go to school and are under their parents' care. Catherine lives together with her husband and children. Together, the couple takes care of the various household expenses.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that Catherine has been selling dried goods (cereals) and other products (sugar, milk, tapioca) from her home for the past twenty years.

This form of work allows her to earn income to support her family as she already is married with two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she liked about Pro Mujer, Vania responded that she liked the training sessions that the institution offers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1570266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy beer and drinks at wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-04-16T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-16T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vania Veronica\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenon Felix\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesusa Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iluminada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2345.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2559.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2629.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2700.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2774.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2850.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2928.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3211.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":392.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":467.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":341.18,"local_amount":2345.65,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2357.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479144949},{"amount":372.23,"local_amount":2559.08,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2572.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838680},{"amount":382.41,"local_amount":2629.08,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2642.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264711},{"amount":392.84,"local_amount":2700.76,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2714.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546814},{"amount":403.59,"local_amount":2774.68,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2788.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530029978},{"amount":414.63,"local_amount":2850.56,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2865.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522200},{"amount":425.99,"local_amount":2928.68,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2943.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655856},{"amount":467.13,"local_amount":3211.51,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3227.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579574874}],"funded_date":"2014-04-21T19:04:46Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:25:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cory Garrett","image":null}},{"id":697595,"name":"Razia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Razia is a 41-year-old married woman who has been running a business selling milk with her husband for many years.
