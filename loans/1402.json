Jos\u00e9 lives with his mother and two nephews.<br \/><br \/>Jos\u00e9 has been farming since the age of 15.  He learned this trade from his father, who thought it would be best to teach him this type of work.  His father figured it would be important to learn agriculture in case Jos\u00e9 was in a situation in which he could not find work, especially for someone who did not learn to read or write.  For this reason, Jos\u00e9 says that he works full time in agriculture and has a daily schedule from 6:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M.  <br \/><br \/>The loan he is requesting will be used to pay the rent on some land where he will plant corn.  Last year, Jos\u00e9 cultivated 7,000 square meters and did very well thanks to God.  Today, he wants to cultivate 10,500 square meters since he was given this opportunity.  He was also offered lower rent, so he wants to take full advantage of this opportunity since last year\u2019s harvest was less than successful.  <br \/><br \/>Jos\u00e9 dreams that God will always

She is a single mother of three young children. She is from one of the municipalities in northern Chinandega, which is located in the western area of the country and is known for its trade, tourism, gold mining, and agriculture. \r\n\r\nYeceira is a microentrepreneur. She owns and manages a beautiful grocery store where she offers basic goods like rice, sugar, beans, oil, shampoo, detergent, frozen food products, sweets, cleaning products, firewood, sardines, instant soup mix, and other items. Yeceira has been a hard worker and a fighter in life. She is responsible and driven to improve herself and to achieve each of her goals and dreams. Because she lacked enough financial resources, she wasn't able to go to school, since she was the oldest of her siblings and had to start working when she was very young to help with household expenses and so that the younger children could go to school. That is how she learned the business of running a grocery store. She learned from her mother and later became independent and started her own grocery store with her own savings. \r\n\r\nToday her dream is to see her children have a career and for her business to grow so that she can make more income. The purpose of this loan is to invest in working capital and stock up on groceries for her business, like basic grains, frozen food products, sweets, detergent, and other items."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1577168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocerues like frozen food products, sweets, basic grains, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-04-16T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-16T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yeceira Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1250.12,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1294.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176624},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":1312.08,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1359.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490871276},{"amount":49.5,"local_amount":1237.57,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1281.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298523},{"amount":51.77,"local_amount":1294.26,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-27T09:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517581352},{"amount":50.99,"local_amount":1274.63,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1320.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530064647},{"amount":45.26,"local_amount":1131.34,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1171.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542557936},{"amount":50.62,"local_amount":1265.51,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1310.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561690798},{"amount":100.77,"local_amount":2519.28,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595205335},{"amount":98.61,"local_amount":2465.21,"processed_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624460772},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1294.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636632020}],"funded_date":"2014-04-26T02:25:50Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:35:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":697708,"name":"Jacob","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacob is a 36-year-old man.

","en":"Kanaiym is 29 years old. She is married and has two toddlers. Kanaiym has a higher education and has a very good reputation both as in her retail business and in her interpersonal relationships. In her business relationships, she is patient and hardworking. As the main source of income for her family, Kanaiym started selling soaps and personal cleaning products. She started this business in 2008 with 10,000 som (KGS). The shop premises is owned by her family which is why Kanaiym does not need to pay rent for the shop. Thanks to Kanaiym's hard work, she has been able to develop and expand her merchandise. This business brings in about 20,000 som (KGS) per money, which serves to cover her family's expenses on food and everyday necessities. The income from the business allowed Kanaiym to expand her sales turnover. It is currently 100,000 som (KGS) on average. For the purpose of further developing her business, Kanaiym turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy soap and personal cleaning products to increase her sales turnover. The earnings from the loan will help Kanaiym expand her business. The received profits will also help her raise and educate her

She is mother of three children under 20 years old who have helped her since the start of her business. The smiling merchant feels motivated by her job, as thanks to this small business she has been able to raise her children.\r\nAracely began with the help of her family, who have helped her with a small quantity of clothes, which she did not hesitate to take advantage of as well as the occasional remittance sent by her brothers who have pursued the American dream. Today she markets in Estel\u00ed, as the people are happy with the store and the kindness with which she receives them. Also it is admirable that she has the motivation to go out and sell to the streets. This is the making of a woman with a vision of growth, as her goals are to have a complete store, with all the products necessary. For this reason, she knows that with the loan from Kiva she will be able to buy more jewelry, new and secondhand clothing and other accessories whose demand have been high. With this, she will be able to continue providing a stable education to her children. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1577912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more jewelry, new and secondhand clothing and other accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-04-16T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-16T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aracely Del Carmen \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":116.66,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":116.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490876393},{"amount":58.58,"local_amount":58.58,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":58.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504303639},{"amount":58.24,"local_amount":58.24,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":58.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517586456},{"amount":58.38,"local_amount":58.38,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":58.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530082020},{"amount":58.12,"local_amount":58.12,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":58.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562921},{"amount":350.02,"local_amount":350.02,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":350.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695556}],"funded_date":"2014-05-15T20:00:26Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:32:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Yamaoka","image":784416}},{"id":698496,"name":"Aida Manuel","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"A Sra Aida de 28 anos de idade, casada m\u00e3e de 3 filhos dos quais 2 sao menor de idade para frequentar a escola e 1 esta a frequentar a escola no ensino prim\u00e1rio.

","en":"Her name is Leidy Johana.  She is a young woman who is full of dreams.  From a young age, she has enjoyed books about illusions, dreams and reality, but through time, these dreams and illusions have become closer to reality because now that she is a woman, she understands clearly that the mission and objective of life is to reach your goals.  She knows clearly that she must fight for what she wants and feels, which is her passion for nursing.  She wants to study for a career in order to become a better person, help the public, and above all else, the greatest reward of being a nurse is seeing patients regain their health based on your treatment.  It would be a big step to see herself as a nurse, helping patients, her friends, and everyone else.  Life has taught her everything good and bad, because for some act of fate, she has lived her whole life far from her father.  However, through God's blessings, she has always had a mother who is wonderful, unparalleled and a fighter who has played the role of father and mother, getting her children ahead through the best path.  She has instilled in them the best values and good habits that characterize them as successful people with goals.\r\n\r\nShe knows that when she has managed to climb the ladder of success and has achieved all of her accomplishments, she will be in a good position to help her siblings, her family, and her wonderful mother who fought to get her ahead and molded her into a better person.  She is only asking to have the tools to reach her dreams, desires and goals regardless of the obstacles.  Her biggest dream is to be better and to show those who did not believe in her that it is possible to be happy and it is possible to reach the stars with the support of your family.\r\n\r\nShe is in need of the loan from Kiva as she does not have the necessary funds.  Thanks to this loan, she will be able to pay for her education more comfortably so that she can be able to get ahead and reach her goals of becoming a nurse.

She is a native of one of the municipalities of Chinandega, which is located in the west of the country, a zone that is known for being productive in business and tourism, and has one of the largest mills in the country, where they produce sugar.  \r\n\r\nShe is a small business owner, and runs her own business that consists of a beautiful grocery store where she sells everyday products such as: rice, beans, oil, sugar, detergents, toilet paper, potatoes, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, plantains, wood, frozen foods, and snacks among others.  The store is located in her home.  She also sells general merchandise such as: clothing for women, men and children, cosmetics, and shoes among other items.  She sells these either by order or in person.  She has regular customers and occasional customers to whom she offers her products in cash and by credit, which she collects on a weekly basis.  She purchases her products in markets and from distributors in her city and other municipalities.  \r\n\r\nHer dreams are to see her children be professionals, to fix up her home in order to give her children a proper house, and to grow her business.  The goal of this new loan is to invest in working capital with general merchandise such as: shorts, shirts, slippers, glasses, bags, and to stock her grocery store, so that she can take advantage of holy week, when she has the most demand in both businesses.  Elizabeth Abigail is very grateful for the support that the Kiva lenders offer to people of few economic means.

","en":"Nurbubu is 50 years old, married, and has four children. She has a high school education and has had her own farm for 14 years, which she started with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her dedication, hard work, and sense of responsibility, Nurbubu was able to increase her herds to include three dairy cows, one horse and 20 sheep. Her family earns around 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Her grown children live on their own and her husband and her youngest son help her around the farm. In order to continue expanding her business, Nurbubu requested a loan with the bank Bai-Tushum to purchase sheep. She plans to use the profits to invest in additional livestock and make repairs to her house.

She is from the municipality of Chinandega, which is located in the west of the country, characterized as a commercial area. Throughout her life she has been very determined, hardworking, and responsible, with a desire for self-improvement to achieve all of her dreams and goals. Due to a lack of economic resources she could not continue studying and was only able to finish high school, but now her dream is to see all of her children become professionals. \r\n\r\nLydia is a micro-entrepreneur, and owns and operates two businesses which are buying and selling live pigs and pork products, and selling new clothes and cosmetics such as: jeans, skirts, blouses, shorts, shirts, bedding, baby clothes, towels, perfumes, lipsticks, blush, eye shadow, eyeliner, and more. She purchases these products in the town markets, and the pigs in the surrounding counties, paying for them up front. She sells and collects payment up front or on credit, collecting weekly payments. She has regular and occasional customers. She has been gradually growing both businesses, which will provide good income for her and her family. \r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a loan to invest in the purchase of a batch of pigs and to increase her merchandise a bit. Lydia thanks the Kiva lenders for the help they provide to people with scarce resources in poor countries like Nicaragua in order for them to have a decent means of working."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1578114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to invest in working capital by purchasing a batch of pigs and to increase her general merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-04-16T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-16T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia Junieth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.83,"local_amount":1270.81,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479176628},{"amount":49.31,"local_amount":1232.64,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490871281},{"amount":51.8,"local_amount":1294.91,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1314.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298528},{"amount":248.06,"local_amount":6201.64,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6295.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530064651}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T14:28:18Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T14:08:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Fried","image":null}},{"id":697742,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a 32-year-old, married man.

She has a high school eduaction and lives with her partner, who is employed as an installation technician. She has a two-and-a-half-year-old little boy that lives with her. \r\n\r\nKarina has been working with beef cattle for two years. She learned the business from her father and decided to work with cattle in order to supplement her household income. She lives about three kilometers from where she works and travels on foot or by oxcart. Her father helps her as well as her life partner on the weekends when he is not at his job. Her schedule varies. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to purchase beef cattle and rent land to grow corn and sorghum.

widow, and has two children. Zhypar has a higher education. She works as an elementary school teacher. As the main source of income for her family, Zhypar practices livestock breeding. She has a lot of experience in this field of business. She started this business over 40 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zhypar's hard work and diligence, she was able to increase her farm to include 1 cow, 2 calves, and 15 sheep. Her monthly income is on average 12,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Zhypar turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows for the future sale of milk and dairy products. Zhypar plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She is also determined to save money to build a new barn for her cattle. One of Zhypar's goals for the future is to repair her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1579871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Talas village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-16T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-16T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhypar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":558.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":558.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":15200.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178582},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":15200.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440580},{"amount":1116.61,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":60800.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":595436197}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T16:03:37Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":697807,"name":"Mariama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 37-year-old Mariama from the Goderich area of Freetown.

In 1996, Venera began practicing agriculture with initial start-up capital in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Currently, Venera has a milk cow and a bull calf on her farm, as well as a 2.44 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows potatoes and sows grains. Her monthly income is more than 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her farm, Venera turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum.\" She requested a loan to buy cows. With the remainder of the loan, she plans to spend it on crop farming, specifically to buy high quality seeds and mineral fertilizers.

Guatemala and is composed of eight ladies who have an excellent track record of making their payments on time! They have decided to apply for another loan with Friendship Bridge and are hopeful that Kiva investors will fund the loans. \r\n\r\nOlga is a 38-year-old married mother of four children and works hard to meet their needs. At a young age she learned about tailoring and has perfected her skills throughout the years. She mainly sews blouses. This is the second loan cycle for this industrious woman. Olga plans to use the funds to purchase materials for her business including all kinds of thread, yarn and fabric. She wants to be able to complete all her current orders and increase her business. In order to meet the demand of her customers, Olga works along with four of her family members in the business. Additionally, she employs three other ladies from the community. This hard-working group is able to produce 120 blouses each week! The benefit of the loans has had a huge impact on Olga and her family as her children is able to attend school. She wants to see them graduate from high school and attend college. Her husband shares this dream as well. The couple wants to make improvements on their home as well. \r\n\r\nAll of the women of the Trust Bank enjoy the educational trainings given at their monthly meetings by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. They look forward to learning new information in this new loan cycle. Some of the topics covered include nutrition, health and personal hygiene, effective business practices (accounting, budgeting, money management, sales) as well as self-esteem. Olga especially enjoyed the training about women\u2019s identity and leadership.\r\n\r\nThe entire \u201cMacadamia\u201d Trust Bank extends greetings and appreciation to KIVA investors. Armed with the loans and education, they are able to create a better and more prosperous future for themselves, their families and their community.

She is single mother of a 8 year old son who studies at school. No one else lives with her. She has been raising cattle for 3 years, something her father taught her and with the persuasion of a cousin she decide on this as a business. She also has a small store. Before that she only had the store. The land where the cattle graze is 2 km from her house and she walks there. She has the help of her brother. Her timetable is not fixed but at 6 am she takes the cattle out and at 4 pm she brings them back to the pasture. The rest of the time she takes care of her child and the store.<br \/><br \/>The loan Armida is requesting is to buy a pair of calves which will improve her business as she will have more cattle and so she can have a better life. The best way is to pay for them at once and the loan will allow her to do this. <br \/><br \/>Her dreams are to expand her store and have more cattle. Then she can provide a better future for her child. The loan will help her as she can buy the calves right away. She will use the profits from her businesses to support her child and pay off the loan. She wants to expand her business with good administration and the loans from CrediCampo. She hopes to pay off the loan well so she can continue to get

","en":"Gulzat is 27 years old, married, and has two toddlers. Gulzat has a secondary-specialized education. She graduated from a vocational school for consumer goods manufacturing. Gulzat is punctual, emphatic, neat and hardworking by nature. Her husband helps her with her business. As an additional source of income for her family, she has been practicing livestock breeding for many years already. She started this business with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulzat's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 2 horses and 55 sheep on her farm, as well as a 2.80 hectare plot of land. This business brings in on average 12,000 som (KGS) per month, which mainly serves to cover the family's food expenses and daily living needs.  For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulzat turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows. Gulzat plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money to increase the size of her barn in the future and to buy a car for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1580492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Talas village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-17T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-17T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.46,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7046},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7257},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7475},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7699},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7930},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8168},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8413},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8666},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8926},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9193},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9469},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9758}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.13},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.18},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":130.35,"local_amount":7046,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":7097.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490749841},{"amount":272.54,"local_amount":14732,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":14839.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178585},{"amount":289.14,"local_amount":15629,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15743.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947242},{"amount":151.11,"local_amount":8168,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8227.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440583},{"amount":315.96,"local_amount":17079,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":17203.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489020},{"amount":165.12,"local_amount":8926,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8991.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.01,"payment_id":595436201},{"amount":165.45,"local_amount":9193,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":9260.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.62,"payment_id":624798933},{"amount":333.87,"local_amount":19227,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":19367.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.83,"payment_id":636161074}],"funded_date":"2014-04-21T14:51:07Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":694686,"name":"D\u00fao Exodo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao Exodo, este d\u00fao esta conformado por la se\u00f1ora Alba de Jesus de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, ella se dedica a la venta de cosmeticos desde hace varios a\u00f1os, en esta oportunidad ella esta solicitando este credito para la compra de mercaderia (cosmeticos)para su negocio esperando que le \u00faedan ayudar con el credito solicitado ya que el sue\u00f1o de ella es agrandar mas su negocio y ayudar a su familia a salir adelante.","en":"D\u00fao Exodo.

Her youngest son attends school; the older children live independently. Sakina has a secondary education. She concretely knows what she wants and goes after it with all of her strength. Sakina knows how to appropriately use and manage her finances in order to achieve her desired goals. As the main source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding. She started this business 25 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Sakina's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow and 20 sheep on her farm. She has all of the conditions necessary to house cattle: a barn and a pasture to graze on. Hay and feed for the cattle have been gathered in sufficient quantities. Her monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Sakina turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Sakina plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She has also been planning for a long time to save money for her son's wedding."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1387.5,"image":{"id":1580512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Francis ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1582507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mbogo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2014-04-17T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-17T02:10:06Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Midland School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6552000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":655200},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":655200},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":655200},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":655200},{"due_date":"2018-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3931200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":655200,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":661492.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490853617},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":655200,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":661492.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504280535},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":655200,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":661492.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561672180},{"amount":249.19,"local_amount":655200,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-28T09:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":661492.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.31,"payment_id":624862433}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T13:51:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":694692,"name":"Elva Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elva tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad y habita en casa propia junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida, su hijo de 14 a\u00f1os y su hija de 9 a\u00f1os de edad.

She has received secondary education. She is calm, and hard-working. Her husband and children help her in her business. As an additional source of income for her family, Venera has been doing farmwork, namely raising livestock and growing produce: cotton and watermelons. Having launched this business basically with nothing, now Venera has two cows, one calf and five sheep. She has 3.5 ha of land, where she grows cotton and watermelons; her own land is 1.05 ha and the rest is leased. Venera's business brings in about 10,000 KGS per month, which serve as the base for covering the cost of food and everyday needs of her family. In order to develop her farm further, Venera has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan to buy mineral fertilizers and premium seeds for the spring planting season. In the fall, Venera will use her revenue to buy livestock for fattening and resale. The gradual increase of livestock will allow her to expand her farm and build a fence."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1580799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is a single man, living with his family in Taiz, Yemen. Emad studied until secondary school, but he didn't finish his studies. He decided to begin his own business. In 2010, Emad started his own business because he realized that it would be profitable due to a new settlement area. With support from his father, Emad could open a phone and accessories store. His business is located in a good area of town and his main customers are the public. He works six days a week and 10 hours a day and gets support every month.  \r\n\r\nEmad warmly thanks Kiva lenders who helped him with his first loan. That loan helped him very much in developing his business and purchasing more goods. His profits also increased since he was able to meet the demands of different types of customers. Having successfully repaid all the installments for the previous loan, Emad is requesting another loan to expand his business more by purchasing more phone accessories. He has applied for a loan of 300,000 YER to strengthen his business. He hopes that this loan will increase his stock, result in more customers, and help him earn a higher profit.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Emad plans to get a bigger store to supply larger quantities of goods.

She is married to Joselito, a driver, and they have children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand-in-hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRosalie owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one jeepney unit (14-16 person capacity), which is paying *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.\r\n\r\nRosalie hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a happy family. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. Jeeps were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1585852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-04-17T17:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-17T17:30:19Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T10:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2003.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479111656},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2671.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490806808},{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:58:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2003.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504229577},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.3,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517516657}],"funded_date":"2014-04-17T18:26:36Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T09:56:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":698115,"name":"Editha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Editha is 60 years old and married with eight children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

Her husband is a carpenter and the wage that he gets from carpentry work is not enough to meet their needs. \r\n\r\nFrom her desire to earn an income on her own, Teresita takes in and raises pigs in their backyard. She's been doing this for five years already. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, Teresita became an active member of Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) and she enjoys the benefit given by the Cooperative. Through PMPC, she obtained the capital to purchase piglets & feed. \r\n\r\nNow, Teresita requests a loan to buy supplies to sustain the hog-raising business she has.

For the next period, she\u2019ll borrow again and buy new piglets. They expect to increase the loan size to buy more piglets and feed. To increase the business, the Sari Mertha group continues to borrow loans from MUK, and they request a bigger loan size. Each of the members receives 2,000,000 IDR. After succeeding with the last loan, Ni Luh wants to borrow a loan to purchase four superior piglets and sell them for fattening pigs. Now, the price for one superior piglet is 500,000 IDR. All the profits from this business will be saved, and she hopes the business will grow and she will become a successful pig breeder.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":1334569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase four superior piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pejarakan - Singaraja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-04-17T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-17T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":2275,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":26000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2275,"local_amount":26000000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":26015692.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561687720}],"funded_date":"2014-04-18T06:29:37Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:11:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":692076,"name":"Deggo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement DEGGO qui a comme pr\u00e9sident Seynabou est compos\u00e9 de 10 personnes.

She is using this loan to purchase building materials and pay for construction labor. She is committed to rebuild her devastated life and in the future would like to build and expand her business to secure the future of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72,"image":{"id":1585971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

","en":"Syrga is 30 and married with one child. She has a higher education, having graduated from professional school with a major in computer repair as well as having received an education in economics. She has nothing but positive references as being a kind, friendly and hardworking woman. Since 2013, Syrga has been selling detergent and other cleaning products as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began with 20,000 KGS. At the moment she has 80,000 KGS in turnover with monthly profits of 25,000 KGS, which serves to cover expenses for her family's food and everyday needs. With the goal of further developing her business, Syrga has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan to purchase detergent and cleaning products, which will allow her to increase her turnover. Profits from the loan will also help Syrga to pay for her son's kindergarten education and in the future will go toward acquiring an apartment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1581210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She rents washing machines and offers internet access, photocopy and scanner services in her own home located in the city of Barranquilla. Two years ago she was inspired by this enterprising idea with the goal of answering the need to increase the income of her household, made up of her husband and 3 adult children. She also wanted to feel busy. So she observed the needs of her neighborhood as far as what services were being offered. She decide to fill the need for washing, photocopying and printing.<br \/><br \/>Today she gets up very early and opens her shop to attend to her clients which are her neighbors and others passing through the area. Her goal is to expand her business daily. So she has come to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with the goal of obtaining a loan through Kiva. She will use it to buy 2 washing machines, a photocopier and a computer. She will have more capacity to provide better service, increase her profits and not have her clients have to wait. The Kiva loan will solve her problem of not having enough capital to make this investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1580199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to
