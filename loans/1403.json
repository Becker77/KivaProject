This is why, taking advantage of the potential for sales, he started his own business, which he had learned about since he was 7 years old by helping a relative with a similar activity. When he decided to be an entrepreneur, he received his parents' support, as they wanted Alan to generate his own income and be able to pay for part of his studies, which he pursues during the day. From the place where Alan serves his customers, he dreams of achieving great goals, such as owning a store and being able to conduct other activities that could generate a higher income. Currently, he is applying for a Kiva loan, which he will use to buy larger quantities of beer, soda, juice, etc. With a higher investment, he will have a better possibility of increasing his sales and slowly achieve his goal of being prosperous, which will be thanks to Kiva. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1580221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy larger quantities of beer, soda, juice, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-04-18T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-18T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.41,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":730000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":63678},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":65588},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67556},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":69583},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":71670},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73820},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76035},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78316},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80665},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83089}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.02},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":63678,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-19T09:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":67603.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479140409},{"amount":35.94,"local_amount":65588,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":69631.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834302},{"amount":37.02,"local_amount":67556,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":71720.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504260422},{"amount":38.13,"local_amount":69583,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":73872.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542706},{"amount":39.27,"local_amount":71670,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76088.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530025955},{"amount":40.45,"local_amount":73820,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":78370.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518145},{"amount":41.11,"local_amount":76035,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":80722.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.55,"payment_id":562430780},{"amount":38.03,"local_amount":78316,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":83143.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.88,"payment_id":579566526},{"amount":38.83,"local_amount":80665,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":85637.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.37,"payment_id":595164039},{"amount":39.92,"local_amount":83089,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":88210.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.61,"payment_id":611788971}],"funded_date":"2014-04-22T00:30:09Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:46:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sergio Echeverri","image":null}},{"id":695196,"name":"Vilma Estela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vilma de 48 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer emprendedora, que busca siempre aprender algo nuevo y ponerlo en pr\u00e1ctica.

Thanks to her hard work, she now has two milking cows, one horse and 25 sheep, as well as everything she needs to care for the animals. She also has a small parcel of land where she harvests corn, potatoes and carrots every year, both for her own use and for sale. Her total monthly income is 15,000 KGS.

His food stall for local vegetable sales began with his father 40 years ago, when they opened the marketplace in their residential sector. He is a 51- year-old whose characteristics are humility, respect, honesty and above all charisma. His roots are as a seller of vegetables which he started over 30 years ago when he helped his father with the family business. Soon after he inherited the business and since then he works rigorously 12 hours daily each week.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage he has is being well-known in the marketplace due to the length time he has been working. Residents and frequent shoppers consider him as one of their family. This is very important for a micro entrepreneur as he has unconsciously achieved one of the most important goals in marketing which is getting into the heart of their buyers and thus generate loyal customers. \r\n\r\nDiogenes will use the loan to pay the business tax and to buy a door for his stall.  The problem which is the bottleneck of his progress is that without this door, he has had goods stolen repeatedly leaving him with only enough money for restocking, and finally to purchase inventory.\r\n\r\nDiogenes has always wanted to continue the tradition of the business as this has been the livelihood of his family for over 30 years and also expand it to be a lasting business over time, becoming a leader in the marketplace where he currently works.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1580226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

The members of this group work in small business selling clothing (wax pagnes, hand-dyed polished cotton called bazins, and embroidered fabric) of excellent quality, necklaces and handbags. Hoping to increase their business capacity, the members of the group decided to collaborate with the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution and this is their second solidarity loan.\r\nMrs. Fatoumata (the woman standing on the extreme left in the photo) sells clothing (wax pagnes, bazins and embroidery) and necklaces of the best quality. She plans to use her loan to buy 25 wax pagnes in Bamako. She sells her merchandise retail in Hamdallaye and as an itinerant saleswoman to her mainly feminine clientele. With this loan, Mrs. Fatoumata hopes to make an average monthly profit of 40 000 FCFA which she will use to reinvest in her business and to provide for petty expenses in her home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1582312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy wax pagnes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-04-18T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-18T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata                           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":66876.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490961057},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":66876.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677396},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":66876.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677042},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":66876.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677043},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":66876.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209627},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66876.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658568}],"funded_date":"2014-04-18T15:22:33Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T17:18:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":698285,"name":"Paul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paul is a 39 year old married man.

He is married with seven children, of which four sons and three daughters who are all married. After retirement, he returned to the region of his birth where he built a large house. He lives there with his wife, one of his sons and his grandchildren. At each big celebration, the whole family reunites around him. This fills him with joy to see them all and get everyone together. In view of the fact that there are many people in the house on these occasions and that the works in the shower and toilets were not finished, he had to resort to requesting a loan of 400 000F from the IMCEC which will enable him to finish the works and make the area look nice.\r\nAs for the expenses, Albert is helped by his children who all get by in life.

When she was younger, she suffered a lot. She required an operation and was mistreated in various ways, so now she wants to help people who are suffering from something. She wants to help with kind words since the nurses that treated her did not treat her with the love that she wanted.\r\n\r\nShe finished school and began working so that she could help her mother, who is the person who loves her the most, but her bosses always scolded her and told her she was good for nothing. One day, she decided to quit and look for another job. This didn't go well for her either, so she decided to quit again. One day, she got a job caring for a 93-year-old grandfather. She began to work when she was 12 years old, so it wasn't difficult for her to understand the work. Later, she decided to quit because the salary wasn't enough to cover her education, which was her dream. \r\n\r\nShe found another job that paid more, but was very difficult since she had to care for a man at night and the schedule was difficult. This time, she did not have a job for a month, and she realized that all of the jobs involved caring for senior citizens at night. This is why she decided to look into Campo Alto for their nursing assistant program. She was very excited to learn about this program and decided that this was what she wanted to study.\r\n\r\nNow, she has a small dilemma because she works far away and does not have enough money, since she has debts and needs to pay rent. She learned about Kiva and it seems to be a good option so that she can finish her studies and move forward.\r\n\r\nShe wants to study since her dream is to help patients to be treated better by nurses. When she worked with senior citizens, she realized that the treatment of patients was not adequate. She worked in clinics and the nurses did not treat the senior citizens with care. She hopes that everything goes well and that she can have her own home to care for senior citizens, who need love."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1580250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay school fees for a semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-04-18T13:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-18T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":290000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":145312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286481},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":145312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225188}],"funded_date":"2014-04-18T13:16:58Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meghan Rishel","image":1056096}},{"id":695223,"name":"Mujeres Triunfadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dora es socia del grupo \u201cMujeres Triunfadoras\u201d constituida por 08 personas activas y responsables la cual pasan a su 7mo ciclo.

Currently, he keeps fighting day to day to support himself financially.\r\n\r\nThanks to his efforts and his desire to get ahead, he works selling staples such as beans, rice, sugar, cereal, cacao, oil, and soap.  He works ten hours a day selling his merchandise.  He carries out his business by special order and as a mobile vendor.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to invest in working capital and to stock his business buying and selling staples, so that in the not-so-distant future he can have a better income.  Juan is thankful for the help that Kiva investors give to people with limited resources and to poor countries such as Nicaragua, to be able to have a decent way to work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1580265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to invest in working capital and to stock his business buying and selling staples such as beans, rice, sugar, cereal, cacao, oil, and soap","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-04-18T14:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-18T14:10:09Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.51,"local_amount":1687.7,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490871291},{"amount":33.72,"local_amount":842.97,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":882.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504298538},{"amount":33.72,"local_amount":842.96,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-27T09:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":882.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517581367},{"amount":33.4,"local_amount":835.02,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":873.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530064662},{"amount":35.27,"local_amount":881.79,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":922.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542557950},{"amount":70.54,"local_amount":1763.62,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1845.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561690810},{"amount":125.84,"local_amount":3145.94,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3292.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579618762}],"funded_date":"2014-05-17T18:22:15Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:23:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":695224,"name":"Imelda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta la historia de Imelda, una madre cabeza de hogar la cual entrego toda su vida a Dios, a su trabajo y a sus 6 hijos, los cuales los cri\u00f3, alimento y educo con su negocio de venta de legumbres.

She has a high school education and knows how to correctly use and budget her income in order to reach financial goals. Barcha works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has two milking cows and 80 sheep as well as everything necessary to care for them properly, including a shed and pasture and sufficient hay and feed, with a monthly income of 15,000 KGS.

","en":"This is the story of Elsa Mejia, a woman with great strength and spirit, who is striving to obtain her dream of studying and becoming a great beautician.  She has confidence that by getting this degree and working in this profession, she will be able to help her family, particularly the youngest member: the sweet and loving Nataly, who is only 9 years old.  Elsa Mejia's daughter has always seen her mother as a role model and a fighter who is ready to go to battle and fight for her ideals and goals.\r\n\r\nThis is how the hopes and dreams of this woman, who wants to be independent, led her to take the turn to start to study at an educational center where, with experience, quality, and good service, they offer the opportunity for her to accomplish her goals.\r\n\r\nElsa Mejia decided to take advantage of this great opportunity and obtain training in an integrated beautician\/cosmetology program.  In this way, she will be able to provide people with the well-being and satisfaction that they seek from her.  She is certain that with responsibility, commitment and perseverance, she will be able to achieve her greatest goals, putting her on the path to success.  This way, she will have a better living standard and a better future for her family.\r\n\r\nFor Elsa Mejia, this is a new opportunity that life, and most of all God, is giving her to make her dreams a reality, always having a lot of faith. This arrangement with Kiva will be a great help to her, because she will be able to rely on help and financial backing so that she can pay her course fees at a lower cost, because her expenses are quite high, and she can use the money she saves to pay for other household or educational expenses that she has.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1580306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-04-18T15:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-18T15:50:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa Mejia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":145312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202339},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":145312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286483},{"amount":75,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":145312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225190}],"funded_date":"2014-04-18T16:02:34Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":695256,"name":"Juan Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan  de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta su bachillerato sali\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2001, se caso hace seis a\u00f1os con su esposa, con quien ha procreado un ni\u00f1o de 3 a\u00f1os de edad, su esposa trabaja todos los d\u00edas de la semana vendiendo tortillas en la comunidad.\n\n\nJuan  trabaja desde joven en la agricultura (siembra de ma\u00edz, frijoles y sorgo) pues se creci\u00f3 con sus padres y era uno de los oficios principales y aprendi\u00f3 la elaboraci\u00f3n de hamacas.\nHoy en d\u00eda trabaja en construcci\u00f3n con un alba\u00f1il de la zona y adem\u00e1s labora de jornalero en los d\u00edas que no trabaja en construcci\u00f3n.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando, es para realizar un viaje a panam\u00e1 donde ira a trabajar en un restaurante, pues \u00e9l tiene familia en dicho pa\u00eds y sue\u00f1a con ir a conocer y trabajar para apoyar a su esposa y darle a su hijo lo mejor.\n\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Juan es construir su propia casa y que donde reside actualmente est\u00e1n alquilando con su esposa, y \u00e9l sue\u00f1a con construir as\u00ed su vivienda en el terreno que le heredo su padre.\n\nAdem\u00e1s quiere darle lo mejor de si a su hijo y a su esposa para que juntos puedan tener mejores condiciones y tener su propio techo donde descansar.","en":"Juan is 31 years old and studied until high school, which he left in 2001.

Because of such big family and responsibilities, she started a small restaurant; a business that has made her manage to pay tuition for her children and look after the whole family. The business has grown into a big eating place in the town of Mbarara, attracting passers-by from Rwanda to Kampala and this is attributed to her courage and determination to change the trend of things in the family.

He has been involved in the work world since he was very young. He started out as a waiter in various popular restaurants in the city of Chinandega. <br \/><br \/>This same energy and enthusiasm lead him to emigrate with the aim of saving money and opening a business in his own country.

Hector has a plot of land near the town center where he raises vegetables and sells them in the market plaza, but he has a great disadvantage that afflicts all the farmers, and it is the high cost of the agricultural supplies, fungicides, insecticides, and larvicides. For this reason, he is applying for economic support, since his business is being affected by this problem and it could even be in danger. Today Hector Alonso is applying for help, given that he wants to continue selling his products and continue supporting his family. He wants to leave his knowledge to his son, since this humble household is one of the principle distributors of vegetables in the region, and not only would his family be affected but also the people who buy his products daily. They have wondered, what would become of us without the farmers? For this reason, it is important to help this great economic sector, since it is what provides the daily food in all the households."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1580347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies, fungicides, insecticides, and larvicides to continue with his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Rionegro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-04-18T17:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-18T17:30:17Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"H\u00e9ctor Alonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":87139},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":89560},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":92048},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":94606},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":97234},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99936},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102712},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":105566},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":108499},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":111514},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":114612},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117796},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121069},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124433},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":127890},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":131443},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":135095},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":138848}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":695268,"name":"Lizeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lizeth:\nLizeth tiene 22 a\u00f1os y naci\u00f3 en Medell\u00edn, Antioquia, poblaci\u00f3n ubicada en el oriente de Colombia.

She is the younger daughter of her family. Her older sister is a public accountant; her mother is a teacher, and her father is retired, after practicing medicine for many years. Despite their economic difficulties, Lizeth managed to graduate as an industrial engineer from the National University of Colombia.\r\n\r\nLizeth's dream is to receive a masters degree in Investigation of Operations at the University of Maastricht and, in order to do so, she needs to solicit the aid of Kiva. This is the only way she can cover the costs of language exams and application to the universities.\r\n\r\nOnce she receives her masters and returns to Colombia, Lizeth hopes to work in the academic area, where she plans to share her knowledge and involve herself in projects that contribute to the economic and industrial growth that will make the region and the country continue to open up to the international economy, which will favorably impact the population.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\nDespite having my family's help to complete my dream, my parents can not cover such elevated costs as these, owing to their limited economic situation. At present, I am part of an investigation group at the national University of Colombia in my native city of Medellin. During my career, I received various types of recognition, including mastering different subjects, such as Statistics II. In addition, I graduated with honors on two occasions, thanks to having one of the best grade averages in my career field.\r\n\r\nKnowledge is fundamental for a people's wellbeing, and I intend to be part of Colombia's progress, studying for a masters in Investigation of Operations. In today's world, with so many commercial agreements between countries, competition between manufacturing and servicing companies is at a demanding level in all fields. The logistics of daily operations demands new strategies and science is called upon to resolve these new challenges that the real world offers us. \r\n\r\nThe masters in my preferred field is offered, especially, in the Netherlands, where the Investigation of Operations has been the object of study for a long time, and that's why I wish to study abroad. The investment necessary to obtain admission to a university in these countries exceeds my present economic capacity. Dreams not only require sacrifice, constancy and desire, but also backing by a society convinced that a citizen's education will lead to wellbeing for many others and that in this manner, all will grow.\r\n\r\nKiva can provide the help I need to overcome the first steps in this long road and the impulse to be able to achieve this masters abroad, given the fact that thanks to Kiva, I will be able to accomplish the study I need to perfect my second language and to apply to the university that will permit me to complete my life's project. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1580331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay application costs for a Masters Program in the Netherlands .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2014-04-18T17:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-18T17:30:17Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lizeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650529944}],"funded_date":"2014-04-18T18:32:58Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":698395,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monica is 60 years old and lives in Nacional, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

As a main source of income for her family, Samara grows produce and raises livestock. Having launched her business in 2012 with 5,000 KGS, now Samara has five dairy cows and five sheep, as well as a land plot with a greenhouse. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. Samara is a member of the Chynara group, which is composed of three members. In order to develop her farm further, Samara has turned to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution to buy mineral fertilizers and greenhouse film as well as prepare the soil for the spring seasonal work. Samara plans to use the resulting income for an additional increase of livestock. She also intends to save up for buying a house to live

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in more profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nOlivia hopes that her business will grow bigger and dreams to have a peaceful life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draws strength from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

","en":"Mahabat is 34 and married with four children, all of whom are of school age or younger. She has a high school education and works in agriculture and animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began in 2003 with the purchase of one calf for 7,000 KGS. Thanks to Mahabat's purposefulness and hard work, she now has two milking cows, two calves and two horses as well as a 2.5 hectare parcel of land on which she grows potatoes and beans, both for her own use and for sale. She also sells milk, and her total monthly income is about 10,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Mahabat has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan to purchase cows, sheep and fertilizers to improve the quality of her soil. She intends to increase her head count of livestock and receive a good harvest from her land, which will translate into an improvement in her family's finances. Mahabat plans to put profits from the loan into expanding her cattle shed and purchasing land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1581619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Orfa needed to find a way to generate an income to help with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nInitially, she started with an ice cream shop but a little bit later she gave up that business to resolve some health issues. Despite this problem, her vision of being an entrepreneur did not go off course. She invested the profit she got with a bit of help from money that her husband in Spain sent to her for a new venture, which is the sale of merchandise, more specifically the sale of shoes and some clothing. Little by little it grew into a small business, and her few clients were loyal because of her charm, affection, respect and humility that she had when looking after them. She reflected a great amount of concern so that her clients felt well attended to and happy with the product. It is this concern that had her request a loan to diversify her products, since she had a big heart and she wanted to satisfy the customers that asked her for a line of clothing in her sales portfolio. \r\n\r\nThis beautiful work that she does allows her to tend to and carry out her role as a mother and a merchant. These are the people that are worth helping; people that have a priority to help their clients before selling them the product.

Hidjran\u2019s wife is a housewife; she can\u2019t work on an incoming business because she takes care of her children. \r\n\r\nThe family is living in Abseron region, but over 20 years their motherland Fuzuli city was occupied, and since then they are IDP, or Internally Displaced Persons. Hidjran is a master; he has been in this business for eight years. Today he wants to increase his business.
