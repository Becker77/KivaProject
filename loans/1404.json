He describes himself as a happy family man. He is married and has two young children; a four-year-old girl and a two-month-old baby boy. Ntalasha operates a mobile money transfer business.  \r\n\r\nNtalasha started running his business in 2012. Since the time he began, he has now managed to open three additional outlets, the most recent being in a busy township called Chilenje, located in the capital city of Zambia, Lusaka. He describes his business as a technology platform that allows people in Zambia to send and receive money quickly and safely. \r\n\r\nNtalasha has a vision to open more mobile money transfer shops throughout the country. He is taking out a Kiva loan so that he can increase his working capital at his new Chilenje shop and pay for the trading booth. This will help Ntalasha to serve more customers and make more profits. The profits help him take care of his growing family. \r\n\r\nNtalasha would like to take this opportunity to thank Kiva lenders.

He is a single man, living with his family in Haja, Yemen. Abdulrazak studied in elementary school, but he couldn't finish his study because of the hard conditions in his family.

Mar\u00eda is the owner of a general store where she sells different products such as groceries, vegetables, pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene items.

She procures these condiments at the big market. \r\n\r\nWhile the other members of the group Sabougnouma plan on making an average profit  of 100,000 francs CFA each over the course of the cycle, Ms. Mamou plans on making 105,000 francs. In addition to paying back the loans, the women use part of the revenues to cope with personal expenses and to increase their business capital. They would like to see this Soro Yiriwaso partnership bolstered, so that inventory shortages are rare. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1583822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fruit for making juice drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-04-19T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-19T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:53:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84851.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490961062},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84851.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677401},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":84851.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677052},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":84851.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677053},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84851.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209634},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":84851.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658571}],"funded_date":"2014-04-19T22:39:41Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T17:18:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":698649,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Betty is married with six children, four of whom go to school.

They have two children; the oldest is 8 and the youngest is 3. Zainab decided to start selling fish some years ago to support her husband\u2019s income and ensure that they could always pay their children\u2019s school fees.\r\n\r\nZainab works six days a week for 8 hours each day. In order to purchase the fish to sell to her customers, Zainab must travel to ports such as Tombo. The high transportation costs in the region are therefore a challenge to Zainab\u2019s business. Despite this challenge she says her business is going well. \r\n\r\nZainab has previously taken out, and dutifully repaid, 3 loans from BRAC Sierra Leone for her business. She wants to use this loan to purchase more fish from her supplier to sell to her customers. \r\n\r\nZainab says a big thank you to the Kiva community for helping her grow her business and look after her family.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1586712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives with her husband and 3 children. Ni Luh developed her pig business by borrowing 1,600,000 IDR from MUK. From the sale of 4 pigs during this period, Ni Luh managed to get a profit of 750,000 IDR. The gain is very helpful to the family's finances as they are currently experiencing difficult times due to the increasingly expensive necessities of life.\r\n\r\nNi Luh, with the Kertha Bakti group, decided to continue borrowing from MUK, due to their being especially helpful in developing their pig businesses. Because the price of pigs and pig feed is growing, Ni Luh expects an increase in borrowing in the next period.\r\n\r\nShe wants to increase her business by keeping local pigs for 'pigroll'.

She has a high school education and knows how to use and budget money correctly in order to achieve financial goals. Anarkan works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 12,000 KGs.

She studied up to the fifth grade when she was young, as she did not have her parent\u2019s support for completing her schooling in an ideal manner. She is the mother of four children, and several years ago her ten-year-old daughter died of a brain tumor.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband have been married for more than 20 years now; and he works every day growing vegetables (cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, and chili peppers). Habila\u2019s youngest daughter and a granddaughter, whom she has been raising since she was very small, live with her in her house. \r\n\r\nHabila has been working for four years raising laying hens and broilers, and currently she has four hundred young chickens.  One hundred of them are already laying eggs, which she sells in the city, and three hundred hens are still maturing. She works every day, beginning at five in the morning when she arises; and she tends to the poultry until well into the afternoon.

He attended school through third grade because his parents did not want to continue sending him so he could work in the fields.  He is married and his wife cares for their home and four children.  He has a 16 year old daughter and three sons who are 13, 12, and 11 years old.  They all attend school and are the only people who depend on him.\r\n\r\nJuan works as a farmer, especially planting vegetables, tomatoes, beans, and chayote.  He says he has done this work for 10 years and has a lot of experience planting vegetables.  He learned this work from an uncle who introduced him to working with vegetables.  Juan also works as a construction worker and works with a tractor that he owns.  His crops are located two kilometers away and he has to walk to get there.  He always receives the support of his wife and children with all of his farm work.\r\n\r\nHe will use this loan to invest in his vegetable crops, specifically his chayote crops, which he wants to plant.

Little by little she has gone making the most of [her situation] to add merchandise and promote it with the large amount of customers that get her cutting, straightening, styling, manicure and pedicure services. With it she has driven even more income. \r\n\r\nHer dreams do not stop. She wants to achieve a larger growth of her business. For this reason, she turns to a Kiva loan, the first financing she has done at the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy hair products, novelty items, perfumes and health products. Her dream of success is to achieve sufficient income to support her children, but her greatest challenge is to attain sufficient work capital to be able to respond to her customers' requests, boost her sales, earn more money and achieve her goal of success."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1580934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy hair products, novelty items, perfumes and health products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-04-19T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-19T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Addy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":157386},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":216108},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":222591},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":229269},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":236147},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":243231},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250528},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":258044},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":265785},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":273759},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":281971},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":365181}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.98},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyssa Hopun","image":1287558}},{"id":698858,"name":"Rosemarie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemarie is a married woman with five children, three of whom attend school.

For nine years, she has been selling a variety of merchandise there, a business prompted by her sister, who is a very successful businesswoman. The products supplied by Nayibi are furniture such as rocking chairs, mirrors, wardrobes, and even vases, which decorate the interiors of the homes inhabited by the families. Every day from 8 in the morning until 9 at night, Nayibi works selling these products, trying to meet her goal of making her business grow. With her beautiful furniture brought from San Pues, a town located in the department of Sucre, where its inhabitants make furniture by hand, especially woven items, Nayibi is very happy and confident of her selection promoting these products in order to win more and more customers and achieve her goal and  great family challenge, which is that of educating her children in conditions of quality, to strengthen their future success.\r\n\r\nShe is now applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing that she has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will buy rocking chairs, mirrors, frames, and decorations, which little by little, with her impetus, will form part of the interiors of the Cartagena families to whom she sells, making their homes pleasant and elegant places.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1580953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Her mother enrolled her in technical courses and she also enrolled her friends, so that they would learn together and become excited about this occupation.  She worked with other seamstresses at age 23, and a short time later she became independent, starting out with her sewing machine, \u201cNegrita ZZ\u201d. Her husband helped her, supporting her enterprise by referring associates, neighbors, relatives, etc. to her.\r\n\r\nNowadays she assembles articles of clothing for various firms, and she also makes women\u2019s shirts and dresses that are made to measure for each client, on her own. In her business she carries out all the activities involved in sewing--from the designing, cutting, preparation and assembling, to the finishing of the pieces--with the exception of the contract work that she does for the companies that send her cut pieces to assemble. \r\n\r\nCurrently she sells on a cash basis, and she works steadily from 6 in the morning until 10 at night; and depending on the contracts that she has for assembling, she extends her work week from Monday to Sunday. Her goal is to continue expanding her business and her intention is that her children will be able to take charge of the small dressmaking business. However, her biggest challenge is having sufficient working capital, so that she can achieve her dreams of prosperity soon. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a CrediKiva loan, her first financing with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will purchase two new commercial machines, in order to increase her competitiveness and win more contracts that will add to her income.  Thus, her clientele will be satisfied, as the quality of her products will improve with her excellent work, and her Kiva loan will be her means of achieving success.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1220.12,"image":{"id":1580937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 pescado de mar, mojarras, c\u00e1rnicos, harinas, hojas de bijao para envolver las hayacas e insumos suficientes para incrementar la producci\u00f3n y vender m\u00e1s, aprovechando la semana mayor que se acerca y el consumo de alimentos se incrementa, tal como lo se\u00f1ala el enfoque de prosperidad que dirige las acciones de Jenry","en":"Jenry is 43 years old. He is a married man and the father of three children, ages 10, 14, and 17 years. To generate income and promote the wellbeing of his family, he earns his living making and selling \"hayacas\" [leaf-wrapped tamales] and \"cheese fingers\" [dough-wrapped cheese sticks]. He also sells beef steaks and organ meat in small quantities, corresponding to the consumption of the families living near his business, who are attracted by the quality of his service. \r\n\r\nHis business idea was born in the year 2007, when he decided to earn his living selling beef in a small shop to generate income for his family. It was strengthened in the year 2011, when his mother-in-law taught him to make hayacas and cheese fingers. Since then, seeing his profitability and turnover, he has not stopped selling them. He prepares them in his former meat market.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to continue growing his business, so he works hard eight hours a day from Monday to Sunday, selling to his regular customers on credit or for cash. They are his own neighbors and friends, or people referred by them. His goal is to improve his shop infrastructure, and his family goal is to increase his income so that his children can obtain professional educations to promote their success. \r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is having enough money to invest and achieve greater profits. This is the reason he is turning to a Kiva loan, his first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With the loan, he will buy ocean fish, freshwater tilapia, meats, flours, bijao leaves [Calathea lutea] for wrapping the hayacas, and enough supplies to increase his production and sales to take advantage of the upcoming holy week. Consumption of foods will increase, as will the focus on prosperity, which drives Jenry's actions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1580944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Thus she can have a prosperous future where she can increase her income to meet her goal of saving a certain monthly amount, either for emergencies or to establish other shops around Estel\u00ed in the future\r\n."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1581009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more shoes (for men, women and children), bags of all styles and, finally, to enter fully into buying and selling cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-04-20T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-20T10:20:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Maritza \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.23,"local_amount":89.23,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":89.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490876422},{"amount":77.89,"local_amount":77.89,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":77.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504303670},{"amount":85.85,"local_amount":85.85,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":85.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517586487},{"amount":81.23,"local_amount":81.23,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":81.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530082049},{"amount":92.2,"local_amount":92.2,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":92.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562949},{"amount":94.92,"local_amount":94.92,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":94.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695583},{"amount":478.68,"local_amount":478.68,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":478.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579627334}],"funded_date":"2014-05-20T10:18:42Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:33:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"amanda moody","image":null}},{"id":697745,"name":"Abdou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Abdou, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 61 ans est enseignant de profession, qui exerce depuis 1977.

She used her own capital to establish the business to generate more income. Unfortunately, over the last year, the business suffered a loss as all of the chicks died of disease. However, the business income was spent to finance Melly's mother's medical treatment costs.  \r\n\r\nNow, Melly wants to recommit the business, but she does not have enough cash to do so. She has applied for an individual loan from TLM of IDR 3,000,000. The loan will be used to purchase 2 boxes of chicks and a feeder. Melly is expecting that the business will run well, so it will enable her to repay the loan and have a better business income. \r\n

After a few years, she decided to start another business in order to boost her income and opened a liquor store in her home. Mar\u00eda used the savings from these two businesses to set up a shop where she sells groceries and small household appliances. Mar\u00eda's husband and her daughter provide whatever help she needs to run the store. Mar\u00eda's husband also contributes his earnings from construction work to meet the family's household expenses.    \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's goal is to find a space for her shop in the local market and offer a greater inventory of products. She has therefore applied for a loan to purchase rice, cooking oil, eggs, and sugar, the goods with the highest demand among her customers. Mar\u00eda will use the income from her store to make improvements to her home. Mar\u00eda feels that funds from Kiva loans are an essential source of support for small business owners like her.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1581036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, cooking oil, eggs, and sugar.

There is no conventional power source in the community so they have no electricity and use candles or oil lamps at night. Now he has the opportunity to acquire a loan to buy a small solar power system. He is very happy because they will be able to have electricity in his home.

She has a high school education and works as an orderly in a care home. Her colleagues describe her as a responsible, purposeful and kind person. Her family is very happy and have good relationships with one another. Her husband and children help around the house. \r\n\r\nSince 2004, Kaliman has been working in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began with 30,000 KGS. Her persistence and hard work allowed her to develop her business so that she now has two milking cows and seven sheep, which bring in about 10,000 KGS per month including sales of milk, a sum which covers her family's everyday expenses and needs, including food. With the goal of further developing her business, Kaliman has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan to purchase cows. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further expanding her business and wants to renovate her house and cover her youngest son's wedding costs.

is 50 and married with four children. Her oldest daughter is a university student and the remaining children are still in grade school. Gulbara has a high school education and works in agriculture and animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she started in 1993 with 1,500 KGS. Thanks to her hard work and purposefulness, she now has three milking cows, two calves, 15 sheep and 10 goats, as well as a shed for keeping her livestock in and plenty of food and hay. Gulbara and her family also farm; they primarily grow potatoes, corn and clover both for their own use and for sale. Their total monthly income is 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Gulbara has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan to purchase cows and calves. She intends to increase the number of livestock she has, which will improve her family's financial situation and allow them to improve their children's

She has been buying and selling seasonal, fresh foodstuffs (tomatoes and peppers) in small quantity and in bulk for 17 years now. She sells her goods at a local market. She knows her suppliers and her customers quite well. She acquired her customers over time thanks to her experience in this line of work. But she often finds herself out of stock, since she has to sell all of her goods before she can restock, due her small amount of capital. She wants to buy crates of tomatoes and bags of peppers so that she will be well stocked and better able to meet the demand of her customers. Doing so will also prevent her from running out of stock and will help her increase her profits. She will use the profits not only to expand her business but also to support her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1287369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy crates of tomatoes and bags of peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2014-04-20T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-20T19:40:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10461},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10832},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11202},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11573},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11944},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12315},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12685},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":13056},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":13427},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":13798},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14168},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14539}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.41,"local_amount":32495,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-04T09:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":33428.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520466225},{"amount":50.95,"local_amount":23517,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-31T09:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":24192.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542416325},{"amount":26.61,"local_amount":12315,"processed_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-03T10:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":12668.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.07,"payment_id":561554203},{"amount":27.21,"local_amount":12685,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-13T11:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":13049.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.27,"payment_id":579459357},{"amount":26.54,"local_amount":13056,"processed_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-31T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":13431.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.75,"payment_id":595070001},{"amount":26.44,"local_amount":13427,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-03T10:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":13812.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.65,"payment_id":611711801},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":13798,"processed_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-11T11:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":14194.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.91,"payment_id":624435819},{"amount":26.42,"local_amount":14168,"processed_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-28T11:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":14575.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.28,"payment_id":637178169},{"amount":28.6,"local_amount":14539,"processed_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":14956.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.9,"payment_id":649775123}],"funded_date":"2014-04-20T21:12:19Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:05:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Smith","image":null}},{"id":699112,"name":"Sahar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sahar is a 23-year-old lady living in a sector in Jordan called Irbid with her family, consisting of four members.

Her goal-oriented nature, persistence and love of hard work have helped her grow her business to the point where she has two dairy cows, four sheep and six goats on her farm, and makes nearly 14,000 som a month before expenses.  She has everything she needs to keep and maintain her animals, such as hay and other fodder.  To further develop her farm, Nazgul is seeking a loan from Bai-Tushum & Partners to buy goats.
