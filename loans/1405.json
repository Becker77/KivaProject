","en":"Gulsara is 47 years old, widow and a mother of 4 children.  Gulsara has a high school education. The main source of income for her family is her livestock and farming business, which she started in 2005 with an initial investment of 6,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Gulsara's persistence and hard work, today she has two cows and a plot of land where she grows cotton.  In addition, Gulsara sells milk from her cows.

He grew up with his mother, who raised and sold chickens for fattening on her own farm.\r\n\r\nThis young man has completed his studies through the high school level in auto mechanics, and he has worked in this activity since he graduated. It has now become his principal source of income. He gets up at 5 in the morning and gets ready to leave by motorcycle for his workplace, which is located in a neighborhood 5 km from his home. He travels to his workplace in this way from Monday to Saturday, and on the weekends he works on the chicken farm with his mother.\r\n\r\nHe does auto mechanic's work as an employee in a shop. He has five years of experience in this work, which has been learned as a result of his effort and exertion in completing his studies. On the weekends, he sells cleaned chickens from his house and delivers orders on his motorcycle.\r\n\r\nThe money will be used to expand and improve the facilities of the farm where they raise chickens, and it will also be used to buy more chickens, since from now on he will be the one who manages the farm. In this way he will obtain better economic income and will be able to help with the expenses and the necessities of his household.\r\n\r\nThe projections that this young man has for the future are to pay off the loan and acquire another to buy a vehicle that will serve for transporting chickens to the stores and dining establishments with which he has contracts, to make bigger facilities that will allow him to have laying hens, and with the good investment of the earnings, he will begin to set up his own shop for preventive maintenance and repair of vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1581770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"

Muhabat has a high school education and her main source of income is a livestock and farming business, which she started 14 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Muhabat's hard work and persistence, she currently has two cows, one calf, and 15 sheep.  She also has a 0.40 hectare-sized plot of land where she grows beans and clover.  She regularly sells milk and other milk products.

After the death of her husband, Barchynkul was left on her own to raise their children.  She decided to take control of her household and to take the responsibility for the finances.  Barchynkul has a high school education.  Her family's main source of income is a livestock business which she started in 1986 with a purchase of cattle for 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Barchynkul's hard work, she currently has one cow and four calves.  She also has a 2.4 hectares of land which she uses to grow potatoes, beans and grasses.

Thanks to Maksura's persistence and hard work, she currently has two cows, three horses, and 35 sheep.  In addition, she has 4 hectares of land where she grows potatoes, pepper and clover for her own use and for sale.  Her monthly income is approximately 20,000 som (KGS).

She works as a homemaker and also raises and sells chickens.\r\n\r\nShe lived and grew up with her parents, who were very humble and hardworking people who also sold chickens and eggs because they worked on their own farm raising laying hens.  She was the oldest of three siblings, so she had to help with the household and farm chores.  This is why it was difficult for her to finish her basic education, and she only made it to third grade.  Time went by and at the right age she met the man who is now her husband.  He works in agriculture and construction, and together they're the parents of two children, who attend school in their community.\r\n\r\nElena has a farm with 50 laying hens and 50 chickens for fattening.  She has done this work for more than 10 years and she'll keep on doing it because it has become her main source of income.  She earns profits that pay for her children's basic needs.  Her husband helps her with this job in the afternoon, because in the morning he does his farming activities.\r\n\r\nThe money will be used to buy chickens and laying hens, because the current ones are depleted. In addition, part of the money will be used to improve a door on the farm and to buy concentrated feed for the birds.\r\n\r\nElena's dreams for the future are to have a farm with the best facilities and to get a new loan to buy an incubator so she'll earn a better income.  She also wants to help her children with their education until they become successful professionals, because one of them wants to be a veterinarian.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1581756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

pocos los habitantes, por lo que ella decide iniciar con la crianza de cerdos, gallinas y pollos. Estos animales llevan su proceso de cuidados correctamente y se venden con facilidad en la zona. Do\u00f1a Mercedes aprendi\u00f3 todo el cuidado de estos animales sola; ya que su esposo sale desde la madrugada a trabajar y regresa por las tardes. Ella junto con sus hijos se encargan del cuidado y mantenimiento de las porquerizas y gallineros. Desde ni\u00f1a ella desempe\u00f1a esta labor y la ha transmitido a sus hijos ya que si desean continuar estudiando deben ayudarla para tener el dinero para viajar una hora hasta el centro de estudio. Ella comenta que cuando las cosas cuestan al final se disfrutan mejor, por eso ella sue\u00f1a con ver a sus hijos graduarse de la universidad y trabajar en algo menos duro que lo que ella realiza. Mercedes solicita este dinero para comprar cerdos de engorde ya que es una buena \u00e9poca para empezar a criarlos. Eligi\u00f3 Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer ya que tomo en cuenta atender una zona que para ellas ha sido olvidada por el pa\u00eds.

Es una zona de campo que llaman Para\u00edso ya que la mayor\u00eda son mujeres y muy trabajadoras. Espera le podamos apoyar para cumplir su sue\u00f1o de madre y llevar el sustento al hogar. ","en":"Mercedes, 54, is married and lives with her three children. She's a very hard worker who is recognized in her area since she's been working there all of her life for the benefit of her family; in her area there aren't many jobs and there are few people, so she decided to start her own business breeding pigs, hens and chickens. These animals are properly taken care of and are easily sold in the area. Mercedes learned to take care of the animals by herself as her husband leaves in the early morning and comes back in the evening. She and her children are in charge of caring for the pigpens and chicken coops. She's been doing this kind of work since she was a little girl and has taught her children how to do it because if they want to continue studying, they need to make some money to afford the the 1-hour trip to school. She says that when it's tough to accomplish something, in the end, you enjoy it more. That's why she dreams of seeing her children graduate from university and get less-strenuous jobs than hers. Mercedes is requesting a loan to buy pigs for fattening as it's a good time to start breeding them. She chose Women's Foundation (Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer) Communal Bank because the women in this group live in an area that has been forgotten by the country. They've suffered a lack of electricity and potable water; they are in need of wells and potable water to cover their basic needs. It's an area in the country that is called \"Paradise\" and most of the people are hard-working women. She hopes we can both help her make her dream for her children come true and help her cover the household expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1581790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

together with her husband, is raising 3 children.  Madina has a secondary education.  Madina's work in animal husbandry, beginning in 1989 with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 KGS, serves as the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Madina's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows, 10 sheep, and 1 calf.  She also has a 2.4 hectare plot of land, on which she grows potatoes, peppers, corn, and clover.  Her monthly income is 16,000 KGS.  Madina is a member of the group \"Bereke Talas,\" which consists of herself and three other people.  With the goal of increasing her business, Madina turned to the Bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan to purchase cows for breeding.  With the income from the loan, she plans to invest in further increasing her number of livestock, and also hopes to save towards purchasing a

family home.\r\n\r\nShe is using the this loan to buy building materials and to pay for construction labor.\r\n\r\nRosita is committed to rebuilding her devastated life, and in the future would like to strengthen and expand her business to secure the future of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1588048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

The same can be said about the residents and their hospitality.  Margarita is a young woman who is no exception.  She welcomes with open arms everyone who comes to her business where she sells basic necessities (rice, sugar, and beans), sodas, and snack foods.  Margarita, age 24, is excited about the opportunity to grow her business.  <br \/><br \/>Thanks to the first loan that she acquired through Kiva, she was able to grow her business in a large way.  She increased her inventory and obtained new products to display in her business.

They applied for a loan of 95,000 YER from AMB.<br \/><br \/>Fatima, 39 years old, has three sons. She is a hardworking married woman who is very dedicated to what she sets out to do. In the beginning her husband was an emigrant in Saudi Arabia. Because of the crisis of the emigration between Yemen and the Saudi Kingdom, most of the Yemeni emigrants came back home. Fatima's husband was one of them. Unfortunately, he didn't save a lot of money. During that time, he stayed an unemployed man for a long time. As a result, Fatima decided to assist him with the expenses of the family.

When he got married, his parents made a cottage with 2 spaces for he and his wife to stay separately with them. \n\nHis family's main income is farming and raising pigs and chickens which can produce many eggs so that he can save a small sum of money every year. However, the accumulative money is not enough to build sanitation facilities. So, he wants to borrow amount of money to complete his desire.\nWith the companionship and help from the Institution; and with the responsibilities of the breadwinner, he believes that he has ability to cope with current work and try to find another job in order to have money to repay for the institution and look after his small family to get better living conditions.\nEven he is still young but

Her business is going well, however, her lack of capital means that she has to sell all of her stock in order to replenish her inventory.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is asking for a loan that will allow her not only to increase her stock, but also to buy another stall where she can sell.

All the children are of school age. Zhazil has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, she works with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding, after having started 18 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Zhazil's purposefulness and hard work, she currently has two dairy cows, one donkey.

Shahri has secondary education. Shahri is by character very responsible, accurate, outgoing and happy. Together with her husband, Shahri works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 20 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 800 som (KGS). Thanks to Shahri's persistent work, her farm currently has two calves and 20 sheep. The monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Shahri turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan to purchase cows to increase the number of livestock.

Mahabat has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Mahabat works with livestock breeding, after having started 14 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Mahabat's persistent work, her farm currently has three dairy cows and sheep. She has all conditions for breeding livestock, and has bought fodder and hay. Mahabat also sells milk and dairy products. The monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Mahabat turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan to purchase cows to increase the number of livestock. Through this she will increase the monthly income from selling dairy products. Mahabat plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock, and also plans to purchase a plot of land to build a house with a

Together with her husband she has two children. In 2004, Gulnara started a business of selling food products, soaps and detergents in her own store, using a sum of 25,000 som (KGS) as start-up capital.

Cauca, poblaci\u00f3n ubicada en el suroriente de Colombia. Es el hijo menor de su familia, su hermana mayor es T\u00e9cnico en Contabilidad y su madre es Auxiliar de Enfermer\u00eda. A pesar de las dificultades econ\u00f3micas que tuvieron, debido a que su madre es cabeza de familia, Jorge Eduardo se pudo graduar como Tecn\u00f3logo de Alimentos de la Universidad del Valle. Sin embargo, y siempre teniendo como meta ser profesional logr\u00f3 repartir su tiempo entre el trabajo que tenia de medio tiempo como tornero en una microempresa, y sus estudios. Aprovechando que estaba en los \u00faltimos semestres de universidad se present\u00f3 a la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, donde ingres\u00f3 ocupando el quinto puesto entre los aceptados para la carrera de Ingenier\u00eda Agroindustrial.\nJorge Eduardo tiene el sue\u00f1o de realizar una maestr\u00eda en el \u00e1rea de Alimentos y Biotecnolog\u00eda y para lograrlo necesita solicitar el apoyo de Kiva, puesto que es la \u00fanica forma para poder cubrir los gastos de ex\u00e1menes de idioma y aplicaci\u00f3n a las universidades. Una vez realice su maestr\u00eda y regrese a Colombia, Jorge Eduardo anhela trabajar en proyectos en el \u00e1rea de la Agricultura, que tenga un gran impacto social y que lleguen a mejoren la calidad de vida de las familias en el campo colombiano.\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia: \nA pesar de que he contado con el apoyo de mi familia para cumplir este sue\u00f1o, nuestra limitada situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica hace imposible llegar a los cubrir gastos tan elevados de un postgrado a nivel nacional y mucho menos internacional. Participe por la beca pasant\u00eda de Colciencias, donde fui seleccionado en el  Programa J\u00f3venes Investigadores e Innovadores \u201cVirginia Guti\u00e9rrez de Pineda\u201d, a trav\u00e9s del cual tuve la posibilidad de continuar el entrenamiento en el campo cient\u00edfico y de desarrollo tecnol\u00f3gico con el desarrollo de mi trabajo \u201cEvaluaci\u00f3n de Weissella confusa como agente probi\u00f3tico en el desarrollo de barras energ\u00e9ticas a base de cereales\u201d. Durante mi pregrado en la Universidad Nacional estuve vinculado como monitor y estudiante auxiliar de investigaci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de haber trabajado con el grupo GIBALABI, donde se escribieron dos art\u00edculos acerca de la Evaluaci\u00f3n de la har\u00eda de semilla de guayaba como fuente de nitr\u00f3geno en las fermentaciones alcoh\u00f3licas y l\u00e1cticas, investigaci\u00f3n que tuvo reconocimientos y premios en varias ciudades del pa\u00eds donde tuve la fortuna de presentarlo.\nKiva ser\u00eda el apoyo que necesito para superar los primeros pasos de este largo camino y el impulso para poder realizar esta maestr\u00eda en el exterior, con la colaboraci\u00f3n de Kiva tendr\u00eda la oportunidad de iniciar los estudios de perfeccionamiento de mi segundo idioma y poder aplicar a la Universidad que me permitir\u00e1 cumplir mi proyecto de vida. \nEstoy seguro que gracias a mi excelencia acad\u00e9mica, constancia, disciplina  y esfuerzo lograr\u00e9 cumplir las metas que me he trazado para ser mejor persona y poder contribuir al progreso de las \u00e1reas rurales colombianas. Debo ser realista y s\u00e9 que con los altos costos que en nuestro pa\u00eds supone realizar estudios de postgrado y sin la ayuda de una beca, no estar\u00eda a mi alcance, ni siquiera en una instituci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, es por eso que he pensado en pa\u00edses como Brasil, donde hay mayores oportunidades de estudio a menores costos. Brasil es un pa\u00eds que le ha apostado a la educaci\u00f3n de calidad, y que est\u00e1 viendo los buenos resultados, la maestr\u00eda en Ingenier\u00eda de Alimentos de la Universidad de Sao Paulo, ser\u00eda una excelente oportunidad de afianzar las fortalezas que he desarrollado en el campo de los alimentos y de aportar los que he aprendido hasta el momento. ","en":"Jorge Eduardo is 28 years old and was born in Palmira, Valle del Cauca, a village in southeast Colombia.  He is the youngest child in his family and his eldest sister is an accounting technician and his mother a nursing auxiliary.  Despite the financial difficulties they have had, he always had a goal of having a career and dividing his time between his work at a small company as a lathe operator and his education.  Taking advantage of the fact that he was in his final semester at university, he went to the Colombian National University where he was accepted and ranked fifth in Agroindustrial Engineering studies.\r\n\r\nJorge Eduardo's dream is to get a masters in Food and Biotechnology, and to do so he needs Kiva's support, since it is the only way he can cover the cost of the university's language exam and application.  Once he receives his masters and returns to Colombia he wants to work on projects in the area of agriculture which will have a social impact and improve the quality of life of Colombian farm workers.\r\n\r\nThis is his story:\r\n\r\nDespite having the support of my family toward fulfilling my dream, our limited economic situation makes it impossible to cover the high costs of postgraduate work on a national level, much less on an international level.  I applied for the \"Pasant\u00eda de Colciencas\" scholarship and was chosen to participate in the \"Virginia Guti\u00e9rrez de Pineda\" Young Researchers and Innovators Program, where I was able to continue my training in the scientific and technological development field with my paper:  \"Evaluaci\u00f3n de Weissella confusa como agente probi\u00f3tico en el desarrollo de barras energ\u00e9ticas a base de cereales\" (study on probiotic lactic bacteria on the development of cereal energy bars).  During my undergraduate studies at the national university I worked as a monitor and auxiliary research student and also worked with the GIBALABI Group, writing two articles on the evaluation of guayaba seed flour as a source of nitrogen in alcoholic and lactic fermentation.  This research received acknowledgement and awards in several cities around the country where I was fortunate enough to present it.\r\n\r\nKiva would be of great help in overcoming the first steps in this long process and would be a boost toward doing my masters abroad.  With the help of Kiva I would have the opportunity to perfect my second language and apply to the university that would allow me to reach my life's goal.\r\n\r\nI am sure that thanks to my excellent academic record, consistency, discipline and effort I will meet the goals I have set for myself to become a better person and to contritube to the progress of rural Colombian areas.  I must be realistic, though, and realize how expensive it is in our country to do postgraduate work without a scholarshilp.  It would not be within my reach even in a public institution, so I am thinking about countries like Brazil where there are better opportunities at lower cost.  Brazil offers quality education and is seeing good results.  A masters in Food Engineering from the University of Sao Paulo would be an excellent opportunity to hone the strengths I have developed in the food field and to contribute what I have learned till now."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1581834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for a masters degree in Foods and Biotechnology.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Palmira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2014-04-21T10:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-21T10:40:03Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1800,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650529945}],"funded_date":"2014-04-21T23:05:36Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":698499,"name":"Abdouhafarou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Abdouhafarou \u00e2g\u00e9 de 31ans a pour conjointe une coiffeuse et p\u00e8re de 02 enfants de 10 et 1an.

Ugiljon also already stocked up on cattle feed. She is requesting a loan to buy high-quality cows to fatten them up and resell them in the future.

She completed up to fourth grade at primary school. She is married - her husband is a security guard - and the couple has two children who live at home. The eldest child is in second grade at school. Soledad and her husband are responsible for covering household costs. Since she was 16 years old, Soledad has worked with her mother selling clothes and, by doing this work, she learned to run her own business.\r\n\r\nSoledad currently works going out to sell clothes and accessories in nearby communities. She travels by bus and has no fixed working hours, though she usually works from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m. Soledad is applying for this loan because she wants to expand her business and to buy shirts and underwear for men and women, as well as women's accessories. This will improve her quality of life as she will sell more and earn higher profits to continue investing in her business. In the future, Soledad would like to have a market stall to sell clothes.

She got married at 18 and had 5 children.  Her husband is a farmer. Her five children live at home with her, three study and the rest work at house. Apart from her immediate family, no one else lives in her house.\r\n\r\n Besides being a homemaker, Mar\u00eda also helps her son and her husband in farming and she has a tilapia hatchery which she raises and later sells. She started her tilapia business 2 years ago; conducting trainings in the community about fish farms was where she had the idea of having her own hatchery. Apart from business generated from the sale of the crop she had no other activities.  She has the hatchery about 100 meters from her house and she doesn\u2019t have a work schedule.   \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan for farming. She will invest it by hiring help to aid her son and husband, in land preparation.

Since there is a lack of proper transportation between these places, lots of auto-rickshaws run to and fro. They mainly help in dropping children at school, as Deoghar has a good number of private schools. Thus there is a great demand for auto-rickshaw drivers. \r\n\r\nAnita (39) is married and the mother of two sons and a daughter who all are studying, while her elder son also works part-time. Her husband owns an auto-rickshaw but it needs to be repaired.  So for now he runs an auto-rickshaw taken on rent from other auto-rickshaw owners and earns 500 INR per day.  Most of his earnings are spent for the maintenance and rent of the auto-rickshaw. The income generated is insufficient to support his family, and the family even does agriculture activities; from this source they earn INR 20,000 per annum. \r\n\r\nAnita wants a loan of INR 8,000 to repair her husband\u2019s auto-rickshaw and hopes this will help her earn more. Anita wants to earn at least enough to she can provide her children with education and facilities to make them capable to stand on their own feet and reach the zenith of success in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1587882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Vulnerable Groups","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to repair their auto-rickshaw","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Deoghar, Jharkhand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-04-21T14:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-21T14:20:10Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-04-21T15:12:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":699527,"name":"Lorena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorena is 33 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by farming bananas in the Philippines.

since she was a young girl, Julia loved to cut and style hair. She would constantly re-style her dolls\u2019 hair and even cut her sister\u2019s and dog\u2019s hair when her mom wasn\u2019t looking! Today, Julia has been doing hair professionally for 15 years. She started out with ULTA, a corporate salon, to receive certification and to enable her to teach others. Since then, Julia has worked in many different salons.\r\n\r\nEvery time Julia relocates, her loyal clientele follow her. When she noticed this trend, she realized that she had a loyal following of over 170 clients who believed in her and trusted her. This was the key moment that inspired Julia to start her own salon. \r\n\r\nJulia will start with two other stylists who will rent chairs in her salon. She also hopes to reach out to beauty schools to find an intern to be her receptionist and hopes to teach other stylists to be better at what they do. Julia wants her business to be different, changing the image of the boutique salon from an expensive and exclusive niche to a place where families can receive affordable quality service.\r\n\r\nJulia loves what she does, because she enjoys building relationships with people, while also making them feel good about themselves. Working on hair is like an art for Julia; it helps her to express her creativity and feel free. \r\n\r\nAs a single mom with one son, it has been difficult for Julia to save enough money to start her own business. She doesn\u2019t want to ask her family for money because she is determined to do this on her own. Julia will use her $10,000 Kiva loan to purchase equipment and inventory for her start-up, as well as to market her services. \r\n\r\nJulia has always believed in herself and is determined to find more ways to do what she loves, living by her life\u2019s motto, \u201ckeep strong, keep going, and never give up.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4668.89,"image":{"id":1588202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She has been running a retail shop since 1999. She works from 6 to 10pm daily and is able to make a fair monthly profit. This will be Christina\u2019s tenth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.

age 37, studied through the sixth grade.  She is married; her husband works in agriculture.  She has two children who live with them.  The older one is a student in the third grade.  No one else lives with them, so their only dependents are their two children.\r\n\r\nShe has a little farm of chickens, which she fattens to later sell.  She has been doing this for three years now.  She had a need to create an extra source of income, so she decided to do something that wouldn\u2019t be too difficult.  She doesn\u2019t have any other job.  The business is located outside her home, so she doesn\u2019t have to travel any distance.  No one else is involved in the business.  Her schedule is from 6 a.m. until 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in increasing her business.  She will also buy more chickens to fatten.  So, with this loan, she won\u2019t go on borrowing money from private sources to keep her business going.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to always keep expanding her sales, and in that way to have a better income with which she can make her business more and more well-known.  The loan will help her to meet the need that she has for working capital.  She will use her earnings to make her payments and to care for her loved

She only managed to study up to 8th grade, due to her parents' economic condition. She helps her mother with house work and her parents with their agricultural labor.\n\nMirna, owing to her widowhood, has worked for the last 6 years selling clothes. This business generates earnings and it is a form of passing the time while she cares for her children, who accompany her during sales efforts, from time to time, as she makes the rounds of the 10 blocks she covers twice a week. Also, mornings, she sells tortillas to her neighbors, which provides another source of money. With this loan Mirna will be able to purchase more merchandise for her business, growing a little more, to arrive at her goal of offering a better life to her little ones, and aspiring to a future. They are preparing themselves, studying to become better persons.\n\nThe funds from the loan will be used to purchase clothing to sell and to buy ingredients for preparing tortillas, and, also, to buy a gas stove. Mirna's greatest dream is to offer schooling to her children as long as possible and for them to have a greater opportunity to achieve a better condition in life through  work, and with her great effort, to be able to purchase a house for her family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1574441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase clothes to sell and a gas stove and more ingredients for making tortillas to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-21T17:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-21T17:40:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":21.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":23.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":24.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":26.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":27.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":27.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.43},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.71},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.14,"local_amount":26.14,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T09:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":26.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480216582},{"amount":28.26,"local_amount":28.26,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":28.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490817981},{"amount":61.27,"local_amount":61.27,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":61.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243340},{"amount":51.81,"local_amount":51.81,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":51.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008887},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":25.02,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":25.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419739},{"amount":37.36,"local_amount":37.36,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":37.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544563},{"amount":70.14,"local_amount":70.14,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":70.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595144953}],"funded_date":"2014-04-22T04:06:04Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":699623,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zenaida is 55 years old and single.

Her children studied through basic education, and are who help her with the economic costs. \r\n\r\nRosa is dedicated to the sale of clothing and has been for 15 years. She understands well the activity that she practices, since a friend helped her to understand the work. \r\n\r\nRosa needs the loan to improve her home and to purchase sheet metal, nails and wood. She will also invest a percentage to purchase more clothing (shirts, skirts and pants among others). \r\n\r\nRosa plans to have a business that is profitable for the support of her family and that her children can know an activity that permits them to achieve their goals and be able to come out ahead. \r\n       "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1574666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sheet metal, nails and wood, she will also invest a percentage to purchase more clothing (shirts, skirts and pants among others).

He is 58 years old and is in excellent physical condition to work. He has 50 acres of land and is growing coffee on five of them. He belongs to the association Pueblos en Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria, and his coffee production has been improving over the past three cycles.The association's technical team made a series of recommendations, and implementing them resulted in an increase in production from 2.5 to 4 tons.\r\n\r\nHis goal for this cycle is to improve his coffee's quality and increase profitability by managing his plantation semi-technically. In order to achieve this, Carlos Alberto is requesting a loan so that he can secure the supplies and fertilizer he needs to maintain his coffee plants. He will invest the income he generates into establishing new areas, because to him one of the advantages of this crop is its profitability."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1581903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair

into business together from the beginning. Both were in monotonous 9 to 5 jobs and felt frustrated that they weren't making any kind of difference in the world. One day in Katherine\u2019s backyard, they talked about starting their own business together, utilizing natural essential oils to make everything from beauty to home care products. The next week, they got their business license and started KB Pure Essentials. \r\n\r\nThe duo makes all of their products at Katherine\u2019s house. Using recipes from doterra.com as their foundation, they modify them in search of the perfect combination of ingredients. What makes Katherine and Brooke such a great team is that they have a unified vision for where they want to take their business. They also each have their own niche in the company and are passionate about what they do; Brooke handles the business aspects, while Katherine is the chemist who creates their products. \r\n\r\n\u201cEverything in our products you can pronounce,\u201d said Brooke, who now only uses the products they sell in her own home. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to a grocery store in two months, and I feel great.\u201d \r\n\r\nThey currently sell their products online and at the local farmers\u2019 markets.  They also employ three of their friends, who help at the markets and in the kitchen creating products.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge that the team faces during the start-up phase of their business is having the cash flow necessary to purchase ingredients for their products and to pay their employees. They will use their $6,000 Kiva loan to purchase the raw ingredients to make 3,000 units of all natural deodorant (their #1 selling product) and to pay their employees. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Katherine and Brooke would like to grow their e-commerce presence, because of its efficiency and inexpensive overhead. They would also like to sell wholesale in high end boutiques and potentially go global. Growing sales will allow them more time to focus on creating new all natural products.\r\n\r\nCheck out KB Pure Essentials online at:
