Both were in monotonous 9 to 5 jobs and felt frustrated that they weren't making any kind of difference in the world. One day in Katherine\u2019s backyard, they talked about starting their own business together, utilizing natural essential oils to make everything from beauty to home care products. The next week, they got their business license and started KB Pure Essentials. \r\n\r\nThe duo makes all of their products at Katherine\u2019s house. Using recipes from doterra.com as their foundation, they modify them in search of the perfect combination of ingredients. What makes Katherine and Brooke such a great team is that they have a unified vision for where they want to take their business. They also each have their own niche in the company and are passionate about what they do; Brooke handles the business aspects, while Katherine is the chemist who creates their products. \r\n\r\n\u201cEverything in our products you can pronounce,\u201d said Brooke, who now only uses the products they sell in her own home. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to a grocery store in two months, and I feel great.\u201d \r\n\r\nThey currently sell their products online and at the local farmers\u2019 markets.  They also employ three of their friends, who help at the markets and in the kitchen creating products.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge that the team faces during the start-up phase of their business is having the cash flow necessary to purchase ingredients for their products and to pay their employees. They will use their $6,000 Kiva loan to purchase the raw ingredients to make 3,000 units of all natural deodorant (their #1 selling product) and to pay their employees. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Katherine and Brooke would like to grow their e-commerce presence, because of its efficiency and inexpensive overhead. They would also like to sell wholesale in high end boutiques and potentially go global. Growing sales will allow them more time to focus on creating new all natural products.\r\n\r\nCheck out KB Pure Essentials online at:

He is therefore seeking a loan which will allow him to apply the inputs and labour needed on his plantation in a timely and effective fashion. With the employment of these resources in his farming activities, Miguel Angel is sure that he will improve the quality and productivity of his land, in particular of his coffee plantation. \r\n\r\nHis plans for the future are to continue investing in establishing new areas of coffee, in order to realise his dream of producing 600 quintals of parchment coffee per cycle, and so improve his family's standard of living."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1581931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Fair Trade"],"use":"to apply the inputs and labour needed on his coffee plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":295,"posted_date":"2014-04-22T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-22T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Phipps","image":null}},{"id":696854,"name":"Edwin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edwin vive en concubinato desde hace 3 a\u00f1os y tiene dos hijos, la familia vive en la comunidad de Chijipina Grande en una casa de ladrillo y cemento que tiene luz y agua Edwin es costurero pero quiere cambiarse al negocio del ganado, la venta de leche y la producci\u00f3n de queso, por lo que necesita credito para comprar dos terneras para empezar su negocio Edwin es la unica fuente de ingresos en su hogar por eso necesita su ayuda, ya que la costura no rinde como Edwin quiere y necesita que su familia tenga mejores condiciones de vida.

They applied for a loan of 90,000 YER from AMB.\r\n\r\nThe president of the group is Hajer. She is a 26-year-old, married woman, and has two children.  Her oldest child is 6 years old and the youngest one is 2 years old. She studied till elementary school, but she couldn't complete her studies, because she got married when she was very young. Due to the harsh conditions inside the family, Hajer decided to seek any business in order to provide her family with the necessary needs. She started her own business with a little amount of money as a cosmetologist.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Hajer started her own business in making up women and brides in her area. Now, she is a famous cosmetologist in her area and works door to door. Unfortunately, she lacks the main capital in order to enlarge her business, and her income is still low. Most of her interests go to the expenses of her family.

She is passionate about nursing because she believes it is the art of caring for people in their physical circumstances and also in other circumstances, such as those the patients live with day to day. This profession, in her opinion, tries to unify a bond not only in the sense of nurse-patient, but also in the sense of two people who put themselves in the other\u2019s shoes, forming a friendship that, in the end, benefits both. The nurse tries to understand the patient, to guide and help him or her, to care for him\/her, to bathe him\/her. But the most important of all is to talk with him\/her and with the family members, helping them to understand the situation in which they find themselves and how to work through it. The nurse isn\u2019t just someone who comes and goes, doing what she is told; she is a friend, she is one who cares.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she was very young, she had an interest in the profession of nursing, imagining when and how it would be the first time she interacted with a patient. She has always felt a liking and passion for working as a health professional. She wants to help patients during their recuperation.\r\n\r\nNow, at 18 years old, she understands what an important role nursing plays in life. So soon after beginning the practice [portion of her program], she feels excitement and also the happiness of achieving and finishing quickly some of her goals so she can begin to change the vision of nursing held by many members of this profession.\r\n\r\nAt this time she is requesting a loan from Kiva because she doesn\u2019t have sufficient economic resources to pay her tuition at the normal price. She has other expenses and what she most needs is to stretch her money a bit.  She would be very grateful if she were to be granted this loan and the support you can give her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1581912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-04-22T00:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-22T00:40:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":160791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202342},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":160791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286487},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":160791.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225194}],"funded_date":"2014-04-22T01:19:35Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":695679,"name":"Graciela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Graciela es soltera, no tiene hijos, vive en La Paz en una casa de acabado fino que le pertenece a sus padres.

The members of the communal bank have a variety of businesses such as selling potatoes, buying and selling sheep and cattle, selling artisanal beds and knitting sweaters, selling shakes, and growing potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit small businesses like Sof\u00eda's. She states that this is the first year being a member of Pro Mujer. She joined after being invited by a promoter of the institution who visited her house. Currently, she has a business machine-knitting sweaters. She shares that she learned this business in 6 months at a training center.

","en":"Emelkan is 62 with a specialist high school education and the mother of five children. She has been working in animal husbandry for many years, a business she began with the purchase of one calf. She now has two cows and six goats as well as everything necessary to care for livestock, with a total monthly income of about 10,000 KGS. Emelkan is responsible and enterprising and knows how to properly care for a household and invest toward a goal.

Her journey with handicrafts started very early in life as a hobby, which she further developed by studying fine art at her local college. Though her early marriage\u2014as is the case with many Iraqi women\u2014altered the growth of her art career, it did not derail her passion for handicrafts. While caring for her family and during her only moments to herself, Najah honed her craft from home and sold her products to relatives and neighbors.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, as her children were growing older and her family\u2019s expenses were increasing, Najah decided to open a handicrafts workshop outside her home. Now, thanks to her passion for her craft and growing business, in addition to supporting her own family, she employs two other women, thereby enabling them to support their families.\r\n\r\nNajah makes beautiful accessories and decor for weddings and social events, specializing in handmade ceramic flowers displayed on plates and in vases. Each life-like sculpture takes approximately six to eight hours to make, and Najah is constantly testing new flowers and innovating her technique. Najah further develops her skills by attending specialized courses and browsing the Internet for inspiration and trends in crafts and art.   \r\n\r\nTo expand her growing business, Najah is taking a SME loan in the amount of 10,000 USD. She will use this loan to move production and sales to a new location in a commercial area with a larger workshop and a showroom to market her one-of-a-kind pieces, an investment that will hopefully drive up sales and inventory. She also plans to hire more women to work with her, training them in her unique craft and economically empowering the women in her community. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi

The loan she received previously allowed her to develop her business and receive profits of about 10,000 KGS from her farming, and she now has a 1.5 hectare piece of land on which she grows beans. Atyrbubu plans to use funds from this loan to cover the cost of mineral fertilizers, fuel and preparing the fields for spring planting.

his life. While working in the car industry, he noticed that dealers often sell cars with previously attached accents. This inhibited dealers from holding larger supplies of desirable accessories. Thus, Luxury Trims was born.\r\n \r\nFounded in 2010, Luxury Trims removes dealers from the equation and allows Juan to sell chrome and other aesthetic accessories. Juan has met with rapid success and even secured an exclusive deal with a Thailand manufacturing company for sole rights on certain products. With a high demand and large customer base, Juan has suffered a slow January this year. Due to heavy snowstorms, he was unable to meet with most of his clients and now needs a loan to help get his business back on track. \r\n\r\nHelp Juan purchase inventory and expand his

","en":"Aijan is turning to bank Bai-Tushum for a repeat loan. She is a member of the Iygilik-3 group as well as other two members besides her.

He is a married father of two who lives in his own house within a traditional family framework in Loulouni, a district in the region of Sikasso, the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali. Daouda has been buying and selling products through his shop (sugar, rice, sweets, oil, cigarettes, etc...) for over two years. He gets his supplies from Sikasso City. This is his first personal loan with the Soro Yiriwaso Micro Finance Institution, which he wants to use in order to better meet the needs of his ever-growing customer base. This loan will allow him to purchase two 50 kg sacks of sugar, two 50 kg sacks of rice, two 20-litre containers of oil, two 12-pack cartons of sweets and three cartons of cigarettes from the main market.

She is a married mother of four who lives with her husband and children within the framework of a nuclear family in Banconi, one of the outlying districts of Sikasso City, within the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali. After leading many unsuccessful ventures, Sanata got started in the business of buying and selling wax prints, mugs and kitchen utensils. She has been doing this for five years. In order to better satisfy her ever-growing customer base, she decided to become involved with the Soro Yiriwaso Micro Finance Institution three years ago. After taking out four group loans, allocated through a women's association within her district, this will be her fourth personal loan. All of the previous loans have been paid back in full.

His colleagues form part of his clientele as he does their logos. His need to be expedient is a priority and he needs to have another machine but he doesn't have the money to buy it. That is the reason he has requested a loan from Kiva, the first loan he has made through  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use it to buy a embroidery machine to meet his market demand.<br \/><br \/>Three years ago he started his own adventure of generating money on his own. He observed how his mother, an experienced sewer paid other companies to embroider and many times they failed to come through with their service. She stressed as she couldn't deliver her product on time having a negative effect on her business. So that is how his sister seeing this weakness in her mother's business decided to buy an embroiderer and Andres was the one who was taught how to use it.<br \/><br \/>Since then he has offered his services from his house and School Directors, student\u2019s families and owners of sports teams have come requesting his services. Sometimes he sells in cash and sometimes on credit, which he collects every week. He works from 8 in the morning until 1 in the afternoon. He buys his supplies from warehouses specializing in the sewing industry. His goal is to buy more embroiderers and manage the business generating employment for people he hires. His challenge is that he does not have the money to quickly carry out his dream of

Urunisa has a high school education, and is the main breadwinner for her family through her work in livestock, which she began 16 years ago, with a purchase of one cattle for 10,000 som (KGS). Determination and hard work have allowed Urunisa to develop her farm to have two dairy cows. The monthly income is 10,000 com (KGS). Urunisa joined the group \"Bereke\" with two other people.

She is married and has three children. She lives with her family in a small village. She loves her children a lot and strives to give them all that they need in order to grow, develop and establish themselves in society. For this reason, Mahina runs her own business in order to have a stable income. Her husband also works with her, helping her to implement her business.<br \/><br \/>Mahina buys and sells children's clothes. She buys her merchandise at a large wholesale market and sells them at the local market in her village. She has her own shop for this. Now Mahina wants to expand her assortment of merchandise.

hardworking 55-year-old woman. She is not married. All of her children are grown-up and have their own families, but Reza lives together with them and helps them both around the house and financially. She is turning to Arvand, not for the first time, for the opportunity to receive financial assistance. When she was lent money previously, she never once broke the conditions of her loan and showed a good side of herself. They all live in the countryside. She does not have a higher education as she was unable to study at university due to financial difficulties in her family. Reza's sons also do not have higher educations but they work hard in the fields, growing different types of crops to make a living and when it is not the growing season, they work abroad in Russia.<br \/><br \/>Reza is a seamstress and earns a living from this trade. She sews ethnic Tajik women's dresses, comforters, pillows and wedding dresses. She receives a good income from this business. Now she wants to increase her amount of merchandise to expand her business. This is why she requested a loan from Arvand to buy materials. Reza really relies on a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for the

She lives in the beautiful village of Santa Cruz. She, together with her husband, manages their one acre of mature cacao trees. Maura raised her 11 children, three of whom are still living with her and her husband. \n\nMaura and her husband became inspired to plant cacao on their own with the assistance of their dad. They grew up in a farming family which assisted them in ways and methods of farming as both a source of income for the family and for household use. Maura stated that her husband spends most of the time planting different types of farm crops such as corn, beans, rice, and other ground foods. She enjoys harvesting and selling products to the market. Maura stated that cacao is a source of income for the family and it is also a permanent crop, which requires cleaning and general maintenance to be highly productive.\n\nMaura is requesting this loan to hire workers to assist her husband in cleaning their cacao farm. Her husband is presently busy with the harvesting of corn and beans as it is the peak season.\n\nIn the future, Maura envisions having better living conditions, expanding more into farming, getting her children to work more on her farm, and, if some of her children so choose, providing them with an education, or, if not, she would love to see her sons become cacao farmers.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":180.22,"image":{"id":1581052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

","en":"This story begins in a rather poor family, in which a girl named Lorena was born. Since she was little she always dreamed of something different from what her family was used to. She dreamed of going far in every way of life, reaching goals to become a professional, and giving her parents a better life, since they had always made an effort to give her what she needed. She did not dare to share her dreams with anyone, because she was afraid they would tease her or that they would simply prevent her from doing what she wanted, since the main concern in the household was the day-to-day life. \r\n\r\nOne day, already being a grown up, she decided to challenge her parents and friends, letting them know what she wanted, but she was told that she was not able to do what she dreamed. She wanted to be a teacher, be the best she could be for the kids, teach them how beautiful life is and the value of each of the lives of the little ones, but the main goal was to be a guide and teach them that dreams can be fulfilled if one decides to do so. She was interrogated and judged by people asking how it would be possible for a person like her to achieve something like that. No matter what she was told, Lorena decided to start studying and move forward in her professional life, each step getting her closer to her goal. \r\n\r\nAlong the way she met all kinds of people, some good and others not so good, but with her personality and effort there were only a few moments that did not change her vision at all. When the family noticed that she was accomplishing what she set out to do, they began to support her which fixed the situation, considering that she was feeling alone. Being able to have love and support, which she extends to the students, also improves the quality of life for her and her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1582525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for one semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-04-23T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-23T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":390000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":143862.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202345},{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":143862.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286490},{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":143862.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225197}],"funded_date":"2014-04-23T02:29:44Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Ronald","image":1493932}},{"id":700019,"name":"Manzoor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manzoor has expertise in embroidery and has been using her skill to provide for her family for over five years now.
