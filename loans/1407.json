She is very energetic, hardworking and enthusiastic; she always devotes her time to getting her family ahead. \r\n\r\nKabita has had her own beauty parlor in her house for the last 5 years. Before starting the beauty parlor, she was helping her husband in a cloth business. She took the training to be a professional beautician and started a parlor. Initially, she started the business with a low profile and limited investment. Gradually she expanded her business and added a few good quality chairs, big mirrors and all types of beauty cream and facial materials. Now she is earning about 6,000 Indian rupees (INR) per month from her business, which is very scanty to manage her family.\r\n\r\nKabita has already taken out loans from Mahashakti two times before.This will be her third loan. With this loan, she will purchase beauty creams, oils, facial items and new chairs. Kabita has a long cherished desire of having a beauty parlor at the market with the cloth shop of her husband.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1589159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She has received several loans already and recently requested PHP 20,000 for cocoland redemption, of which she could use the land for planting an agricultural commodity to earn more income. Being a MIGS member (Member in Good Standing) of the cooperative, she has been able to manage her income. She is able to provide for the daily needs of her family.

She is married and is mother to 3 children, who help her in the different activities at the fields. She attended elementary school but did not complete it, having done up to fourth grade. She is thankful for the moral and financial support given by her parents despite the many difficulties at that time because the produced income was not enough to cover all expenses; and they decided to teach her to work the land, which she has done for more than 10 years. Another way of generating income in her household is through the sale of second hand clothing, which she does from her home.

She resides with her family in the village named Samserpadar of Nuapada district in Odisha, India. Bhairabi hails from a very poor Schedule Caste family of Below Poverty Line.\r\n\r\nBhairabi herself has been running a general grocery shop in a wooden cabin in her small village for the last seven years with the help of her husband who is also a very hardworking fellow. Bhairabi sells items like soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, oil, etc. in her shop. She started the business with a small investment of her own. At that time her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR. It was very difficult on her part to maintain the family. So in the year 2009 she with four other women of her village and formed a Joint Liability group and contacted Mahashakti Foundation for loan to develop her business. \r\n\r\nIn the mean time she has already availed two loans from Mahashakti Foundation and has repaid them successfully. She has also added different daily need items in her shop as per the demand of the customers. She is very happy that with the loan support she has been able to expand her business and established it. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is earning a monthly income of 5,000 INR. As per the statement of Bhairabi, this small income is not at all sufficient to manage the family along with educational expenses of her children. So she wants to increase her income by expansion of her existing business. \r\n\r\nIn 2014 she motivated other women members of her village and formed a Self Help Group of 16 women for a fresh loan. From the present loan she has purchased items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potato, onion, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently from a distance of 15 kilometer. She hopes that this investment will give her more income and that with enough savings she will be able to construct a house for her family as well as a permanent cabin for her business. \r\n\r\nThe other 15 members of the group also do business like general store, vegetable vending, milk business etc. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1589370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potato, onion, etc. for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"SAMSERPADAR, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-04-23T14:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-23T14:20:05Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhairabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Birasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tule ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khiramani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hindula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukmani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brundabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asthami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dsambari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purmnami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanchala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":196000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":196000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-18T21:02:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":700320,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is taking a loan of $800 to improve her business.

She studied until the third grade. Her partner, who she has been with for 23 years, works in agriculture. Together they have 3 children, one of which lives on their their own with their partner, and two of which live at home and are in secondary education. In their free time they help their father carry out agricultural work in the home where only four people live.\r\n\r\nHaydee sells dairy products such as cheese and milk, which she buys and then resells. In this way she makes a profit, generates income, and helps her husband with household expenses. She has been working in this business for about 23 years. Her father taught her the trade and developed their business in the town near their home. They traveled 23 kilometers by bus every day in order to sell their products. She works for 6 hours a day.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in the purchase of milk, which is where she gets her cheese and curds to sell.

His father taught him how to grow corn, beans and sorghum as well as other agricultural crops. He has another job, working part time as a plumber for a water board which supplies all of the town where he lives. \r\n\r\nHis strongest role is in agriculture, as this has been his main source of income and food provision. He does not have to travel far, as the land he works on is the same place where he lives. What he finds difficult is getting the agricultural supplies to his home. He travels 13km by bus to fetch them and works 7 hours a day.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan requested to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, manure and fertilizers, among other things. This will increase his production, because using the loan he will be able to buy more supplies, sow more crops, and make more income.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to produce more grains and set up a business in his home town, so he can have a better income to cover his family's occasional needs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1582839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds, manure, fertilizers etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-23T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-23T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexis Geovanny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":48.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":52.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":53.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":56.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.04,"local_amount":48.04,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":48.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818025},{"amount":97.24,"local_amount":97.24,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":97.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243375},{"amount":49.59,"local_amount":49.59,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":49.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526500},{"amount":48.45,"local_amount":48.45,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":48.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542500974},{"amount":109.7,"local_amount":109.7,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":109.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419775},{"amount":46.98,"local_amount":46.98,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":46.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544591}],"funded_date":"2014-04-26T21:11:51Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:32:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":697037,"name":"Yon Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yon ha trabajado toda la vida en el campo como mayordomo de finca y recolector de caf\u00e9, pero desde hace ya 3 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 iniciar con su propio negocio de producci\u00f3n y venta de ganado, esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 desde muy peque\u00f1o de sus abuelos y t\u00edos.\nEn estos momentos cuenta con un peque\u00f1o lote de ganado pero desea ampliar su negocio con mas animales; por esta raz\u00f3n solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar 2 cabeza de ganado  y as\u00ed aumentar su capital.\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o es poseer un terreno donde pueda tener sus animales ya que siempre ha tenido que utilizar pastos prestados.\nSu mayor desaf\u00edo es la falta de capital para trabajar y el precio tan bajo de la carne en su regi\u00f3n.\nEste hombre luchador es soltero y no tiene hijos pero siempre vela por la salud y bienestar de su madre que tiene una edad bastante avanzada.\n","en":"Yon has worked his whole life in the countryside as a farm manager and coffee picker, but three years ago decided to start his own business raising and selling cattle.

He believes that it is very important to keep his business active since it is his main source of income.  <br \/><br \/>For this reason, the borrower has requested a loan from Apoyo Integral so that he can invest in the purchase of merchandise for his store such as eggs, snack foods, sugar, rice, milk, beans, sweet bread, and other products that are attractive to customers.  He hopes to achieve his dream of maintaining an active business.  This would allow him to continue working for a better future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1582588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups","Youth"],"use":"to buy eggs, snack foods, sugar, rice, milk, beans, sweet bread, and other products to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-04-23T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-23T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":45.85,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-19T09:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":45.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491254564},{"amount":47.34,"local_amount":47.34,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":47.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504170169},{"amount":51,"local_amount":51,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519529601},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":20.65,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595083214},{"amount":335.16,"local_amount":335.16,"processed_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T10:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":335.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611988909}],"funded_date":"2014-04-27T21:58:25Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T10:48:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":700420,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma started her sari-sari store business when she requested a loan from ASKI.

Her biggest challenge is that the cost of farm inputs is high.\nJuliana chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because their interest rates are a bit lower than for other microfinance institutions.

His biggest challenge is during seasons of low sales.\r\n\r\nAndrew chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer low interest rates on their loans. During the training, he learned how to grow his income as a smallholder farmer. This loan will ensure that there is more supply of milk and thus more income.

She is a veterinary and animal care technician. She began a business 10 months ago, but it is a somewhat curious business that is seldom seen in the city of Medellin, and it is the sale of clothing for pets. This business is very unusual, but with it she hopes to have a big impact due to the awareness that we have for pets today. Milena is taking advantage of this new evolution in thought with regard to her shop, having as her principal public our furry friends. Like every new entrepreneur, she has a problem, and that is the lack of resources to innovate her business and have a bigger impact on her public and her future customers. She is asking for an overlock sewing machine to begin her own designs, and the product will be more economical since she will be the one who designs and makes them. She only hopes that you will support this project, given that like everyone, she has a dream, and that of Milena is to be able to distribute her product to the principal stores of the city and that the awareness of the care of pets is reaching a greater number of people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1582781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Muhabat has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practices crop farming and livestock breeding. She started this business 15 years ago with 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Muhabat's determination and hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 2 calves and 10 sheep on her farm. Additionally, Muhabat sells milk.

Kalydykyz has a secondary education. She is calm, even-tempered and hardworking by nature. Her husband and her children help her with her business. As an additional source of income for her family, she has been practicing crop farming and livestock breeding for many years. She started this business in 1996 with 40,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Kaldykyz's hard work, she has 1 milk cow, 20 sheep, 1 calf, 3 horses and 2 bull calves on her farm. She also cultivates a 3.36 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans and clover. This business brings in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and dairy products. For the purpose of the further development of her farm, Kaldykyz turned to MicroFinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum.\" She requested a loan to buy sheep. She will also spend a portion of the loan to buy mineral fertilizers. Kaldykyz plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further expansion of her farm.

Her husband is a civil engineer.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Teresa is a teacher, and she has a private kindergarten in which, with the help of four people to whom she pays a monthly salary, she gives the best education to the children. She also sells clothing of all types and Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and women's accessories), an activity that she does door to door and in the kindergarten. She also sells uniforms to her students and certain supplies and materials that they use every day. She has had the kindergarten for more than nine years, and with it she is getting ahead and helping other colleagues in an activity that she loves, which is educating her little children.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy educational games as well as clothing and Avon products.

Now, her children are already married and have their own family. At this time, Leticia wants to continue to operate her business and gain profits to save for their future. In this regard, Leticia is asking for a loan of PHP 18,000 to buy piglets to raise and feed for maintenance. She hopes to succeed with the business she has, to have savings and be able to help her grandchildren, too."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1590002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy piglets to raise and feed for maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Ramona, Angadanan, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2014-04-24T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-24T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.53,"local_amount":1462.6,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1536.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542424892},{"amount":287.08,"local_amount":12158.61,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12774.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636552050},{"amount":38.51,"local_amount":1630.82,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-30T12:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1713.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":652653357},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":1180,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1239.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666769225},{"amount":37.02,"local_amount":1567.97,"processed_date":"2015-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683445865}],"funded_date":"2014-04-24T05:59:24Z","paid_date":"2015-07-26T12:11:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":700570,"name":"Lamula","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lamula is married with three children and all her children go to school.
