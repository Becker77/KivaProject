   ","en":"Sayora is a 29-year-old resident of the Hamadoni Distict who masters the skill of sewing. She began to do this trade professionally not too long ago. This year will mark one year since she has began taking orders for sewing ethnic Tajik women's dresses. Sayora runs this business from her home. She manages to look after her two children, run the household and simultaneously run her sewing business. Sayora's husband left to work abroad in Russia, placing all of the concerns about the household and the children on Sayora's delicate shoulders.

In the summer Oksana releases her livestock onto the plains, and during the winter she keeps them at her farm. Her husband and children actively help on the farm. \r\n\r\nShe is taking a loan from Bai-Tushum to buy cows. Increasing her herd will improve her family's living conditions and provide her children a good

She has a high school education. Her family's main source of income since 1977 has come from raising livestock. She started with one cow, and through her hard work, now has two diary cows and 12 sheep. She sells milk and dairy products every day. Her monthly income is 24,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nTo meet her long-term goals of growing her business, Asylzhan took a loan from Bai-Tushum to buy calves to fatten and eventually sell at the market for a high price. She plans to use the income from the loan to buy more livestock in the future and repair her house.

","en":"Ramila is a 55 year old divorced mother of three. The children actively help her on the farm. Ramila, having a high school education, is the main breadwinner for her family, engaging in raising livestock and farming, which she began in 1994 with 10,000 som (KGS), and thanks to the hard work of Ramila, today she has two diary cows and one horse. Also she has a 0.82 hectare land stake which at this time she is growing potatoes and wheat for non-farm consumption. Additionally Ramila sells milk. Her monthly total income is about 20,000 som (KGS). In order to develop her farm, Ramila asked the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan to purchase cows, with part of the money spent on spring field work. Ramila intends to increase her number of cattle and have a good harvest, which will inevitably lead to an increase in her family's capital. With income she makes off the loan, Ramila plans to make repairs on her home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1470.08,"image":{"id":1587470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karakol town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-24T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-24T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":112.12,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":117000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":37000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":735.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":551.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":679.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":183.66,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10000.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.1,"payment_id":595436236},{"amount":49.06,"local_amount":2796.87,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2796.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.34,"payment_id":681290764},{"amount":666.47,"local_amount":37203.13,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":37204.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.17,"payment_id":696500014},{"amount":458.77,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30000.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":92.51,"payment_id":752025323}],"funded_date":"2014-05-22T21:56:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Terrin","image":225925}},{"id":700897,"name":"Lam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Lam is 38 years old, married, the mother of two children, and earns a living by raising poultry and\u00a0cattle.

As a main source of income for her family, she has been involved since 2005 in raising livestock and crops. Nurisa knows how to properly use and plan her monetary resources to achieve goals. Thanks to her hard work, her homestead now has 15 sheep. She has all the conditions to care for livestock: a barn and remote pastures.

Guljahon cooks traditional, national sausages at home for sale. Guljahon's product is so tasty, and he brings them to the grocery market and sells them wholesale. But this is not her main work; in addition to preparing national sausages, she also trades at the market.<br \/><br \/>Guljahon sells children's clothing. She began her own business not long ago, and previously sold vegetables, but eventually moved to selling children's clothing. Guljahon transports children's things from the city. With the onset of spring, Guljahon must bring seasonal spring articles. Since winter was cold, trade was also a bit frozen and of course turnover decreased. In order to buy goods, Guljahon needs money and therefore she put in a loan application in hope that the organization Arvand would support her and provide services in a timely manner. <br \/><br \/>All her aspirations and perseverance are for the sake of her family's well-being.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

For the past 21 years she has been providing this type of support at a hospital in Masaya, thanks to her degree in nursing.  <br \/><br \/>For this reason, Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Elena knew that it was necessary that she have good sanitation services in her home.  She is requesting a loan in order to build a bathroom with a toilet.  The existing facilities are in an extremely deteriorated condition and could cause an accident at any moment.  Furthermore, the conditions for this type of service could attract animals that spread diseases.  The positive side is that this heroine of the Nicaraguan health system places value on being highly responsible.  As a result, her goals are to take advantage of this loan and to repay it on time and in the correct manner."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":541.16,"image":{"id":1581967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

During this period, 2 of the group members successfully managed their pig businesses and were able to continue with their own capital. They decided to resign from the group.\r\n\r\nAfter succeeding with their last loan and inspired by 2 of their friends, the remaining 8 members of the Mulya Sari group received their new loan. Now most of the members already have sows.

His wife and him buy the harvest of said fruit and sell them to people at the market, his step son also helps with this task.\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used to hire labor to help him cultivate and clean the land as him, his wife and his step son alone feel they take too long with the work. In this manner they will begin to prepare the land. \r\nVictor also wants to use the rest of the money to buy a calf. He used to have two, but one fell down a slope and was injured irreparably. He will look for a companion for the remaining one because when they grow they will be the ones who pull the corn for the home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1583074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"hire labor to help him farm and clean the land and to buy a calf","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-24T21:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-24T21:20:11Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146391}],"funded_date":"2014-05-23T01:57:29Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Samuel Martinez","image":null}},{"id":700987,"name":"Mutindi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mutindi is a married woman with one child who attends school.

Her children are grown and independent. Sharafniso has always been a housewife and has not worked anywhere. All these years she has been running their domestic lives and raising their children.  \r\n\r\nNow that her children are grown, she has a lot of free time. She wants to use this time to start her own business. Sharafniso loves to look after cattle--she has one dairy cow. She wants to start business fattening and selling livestock. \r\n\r\nSharafniso also wants to earn her own income and feel independent. She does not have the seed capital, and thus took a loan to buy a few steer and calves. Your support is important to her.

She headed to Al-Amal Microfinance Bank and requested a loan in the amount of YER 1,500,000 to start up her accessories store. \r\n\r\nTahani hopes that her business succeeds, so she can have a decent

He is married and he has a family.  His elderly parents live with him.  Zarif is not afraid of life's difficulties.  Since he has a very friendly disposition, he gets along well with everyone and doesn't mind being responsible for a large family.  His wife works and also helps him.  His children are growing but they're still in school and Zarif pays close attention to their education.\r\n\r\nZarif makes a living repairing houses.  In addition to this, and in order to improve his family's living conditions, he also manufactures and sells wooden crates every year during the fruits and vegetables ripening season.\r\n\r\nWith the onset of spring, Zarif wants to start making a large supply of crates, but he doesn't have enough money to buy the necessary materials.  He has therefore decided to take a loan with Arvand.  The amount of 5,000 somoni will help him to buy the materials he needs.  Zarif thanks you in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1579912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy wooden planks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-25T02:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-25T02:00:13Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.85,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":344.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":356.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":368.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":380.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":393.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":406.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":420.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":435.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":449.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":465.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":480.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":498.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.34,"local_amount":344.5,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":349.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875701},{"amount":74.8,"local_amount":356.18,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":360.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302925},{"amount":77.33,"local_amount":368.25,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":373.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585724},{"amount":79.96,"local_amount":380.74,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":385.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081307},{"amount":82.66,"local_amount":393.64,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":398.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562184},{"amount":85.47,"local_amount":406.99,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":412.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694875},{"amount":88.37,"local_amount":420.79,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":426.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626664},{"amount":485.22,"local_amount":2328.91,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.85,"payment_id":595209149}],"funded_date":"2014-05-23T05:07:40Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":701072,"name":"Pato","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pato is 55 years old and is married with two children.

She has been in a relationship for 10 years.  Her children include seven daughters and one son.  They do not attend school because of a lack of financial resources.  Her husband is a blacksmith who produces machetes and then sells them in the city plazas on Sundays.  Mar\u00eda and her husband live at home with their children and a granddaughter, so the must provide for their daily needs.  They are a very close family.  Mar\u00eda has been a client of CrediCampo for four years.  <br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda\u2019s children work at her husband\u2019s blacksmith shop, help with managing her small store, and take care of the farming duties.  She has a store in her home that she started five years ago.  At the moment, she sells basic necessities such as rice, beans, oil, eggs, sugar, vegetables, salt, snack foods, and other household products.  Maria also butchers pigs and cows and prepares bread and tamales for sale.  Her older daughters help her with making sales in their community and in the city.  On top of that, she raises pigs and cattle on a small scale.  <br \/><br \/>The loan she is requesting from CrediCampo will be used to buy a cow that is valued at $500 and will be acquired in her community.  The remaining $500 will be invested in the restocking of her store.  Thanks to her efforts, she was able to acquire a space at the central market in her community.  She wants to buy a variety of merchandise so that she can generate better earnings.  Maria will begin occupying her space at the market within the next week.

He lives in Kisii village, an area in Kenya that never goes dry. Dairy farming thrives in this region. Justine enjoys making a living through selling milk and eggs from his farm despite challenges such as the lack of adequate capital. He gets the most milk from 'Brown' (his favourite dairy cow). \r\n\r\nJustine today is here before you seeking a loan to purchase an additional dairy cow. He believes asset growth is crucial for any farmer. With an additional income-generating asset, he will raise more capital to meet his farming costs and inputs.
