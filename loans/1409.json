She works from 8.00 am to 6.30 pm, and then tends to her family. \r\n\r\nEven though Salamatu is proud of her business, it faces a challenge from the poor transportation infrastructure in the area. This makes traveling to purchase stock or reach new markets slow and expensive. \r\n\r\nSalamatu would like to use this loan to buy palm oil in bulk (by the gallon). This would allow her business to remain profitable. \r\n\r\nShe would like to thank BRAC Sierra Leone and the Kiva lenders for helping her and her business.

She is a very caring person, she is sociable, and she is very responsible. She was living very happily, but she met a person whom she went to live with for a time. However, it did not go well for her because this person did not treat her in the best way and they had many problems. Apart from that, her sister passed away from a very serious disease and a short time later, she learned that her husband had been unfaithful. \r\n\r\nAll of these problems led Denis to enter a shaky emotional state, but she then remembered that she has two beautiful children who are the most precious gift God has ever given her.

In order to have income for survival, Asror is engaged in his favorite activity. For a few years now, Asror has been working as a tractor operator. He has his own tractor.<br \/><br \/>Asror also has a small plot of land, on which he sows and irrigates some crops. Then when he collects the harvest, he sells it and gets an income. But the main income he receives is from operating the tractor. Now, he is working in the field as it is planting season, and he is using the tractor a lot. Therefore, he needs to purchase fuel for the tractor, but he does not have money to buy it. Therefore, Asror applied to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to purchase fuel for his tractor. He hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the

","en":"Mehriniso, at 45 years old, is an active, rural woman.  She is from Qubadiyon.  Mehriniso decided to start a business buying and selling cattle.  With money that her husband sends from his work in Russia, she has stocked up on feed for cattle, but now has very little money.  Mehriniso hopes that, with a loan, she will be able to purchase three, high quality young steers.  With the help of her children, she will raise the cattle in a barn near her home, fatten them for 30-35 days, and then sell them at the cattle market for a profit.

now all independent.  Her youngest son and her husband help her run the farming business.  Aliyma has a secondary education and she is involved in agriculture and animal husbandry, activities which constitute the main source of income for her  family.  She started in 1974, and thanks to her persistence and hard work, she now owns two dairy cows, 10 calves, 10 sheep and two horses.\r\n\r\nAliyma sells milk and milk products.  She makes a total income of about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy some cows and, to a lesser extent, some sheep.  Aliyma wants to increase her cattle headcount, which will surely bring more capital for her family.  Aliyma is planning to reinvest the earnings from her loan into increasing the size of her cattle sheds.  She would also like to buy a truck to go to out to the \"jayloo\", or summer highland pastures."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":1588876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows and a few sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Jilga village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-25T22:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-25T22:40:01Z","loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aliyma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":370.84,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":20180.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578423},{"amount":370.84,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20180.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489052},{"amount":370.61,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20180.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":595436239},{"amount":365.89,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20180.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.94,"payment_id":610751255},{"amount":360.57,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":20180.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.26,"payment_id":624798957},{"amount":347.89,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20180.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.94,"payment_id":636161107}],"funded_date":"2014-04-29T09:06:22Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":698026,"name":"Melba Liliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Melba, tiene 27 a\u00f1os  de edad, es madre soltera, tiene 2 hijos y vive en vive en el municipio de Choloma, Cortes, junto a su abuela y sus hijos.

She enjoys dairy farming a lot and names each animal she gets.  Recently, Salina formed a group composed of fellow women. They joined Juhudi Kilimo as a group where they got trained on modern farming practices (mainly poultry). Salina had always kept chickens for subsistence purposes, but now she is educated on how she can turn it into a big business.  Salina is seeking a loan to construct a poultry unit where she can keep broilers and layers. By embracing modern commercial techniques, she will be able to generate enough income to comfortably repay the loan and take better care of her eight children. She will also be able to act as a model farmer for other women in her area who keep chickens for

Ten years ago she learned this trade from some friends who were in this business, and when she was ready she decided to start work independently.  She made her first order directly to the suppliers, and this is how she started to build her own business.  \r\n\r\nToday her work does not cease; she offers her merchandise for sale daily in her domestic market, made up of friends, neighbors, and employees.  Over time, they refer others to her business, and so her business has become stronger over time.

Sus vecinos son sus principales compradores y tambi\u00e9n muchas personas que se encuentran empleadas y a las que Abel y su esposa, les ofrecen cr\u00e9dito para que de forma f\u00e1cil y ajustada a su presupuesto, puedan obtener los art\u00edculos que desean. En la actualidad Abel est\u00e1 acudiendo a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 mercanc\u00eda variada, dirigida a mujeres especialmente, pues se acerca el d\u00eda de la madre y Abel y su esposa quieren tener sus inventarios bien dotados de lo que los clientes requieran en esta temporada, para vender y ganar un poco mas de dinero aprovechando la \u00e9poca. Su meta de crecimiento  empresarial no se detiene, porque tiene como meta familiar, lograr viajar a Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica, para compartir con su familia. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es no tener los recursos suficientes para lograr cada vez un mayor bienestar .","en":"Abel is 34 years old. He has been working as a merchant since February of 2009. He and his wife found out they could buy items from companies connected to multinational firms that sell things through special catalogs. They believed that they could earn money with this business. Their minds made up, they joined with these multi-level commercial chains and then began adding more items. Their customers requested a variety of jeans, cosmetics, footwear, nightwear, etc. Little by little, they pulled together some capital and had to buy 2 vitrines in order to show their products and keep their business tidy. Now their business looks organized and Abel and his wife work in their business and it is their main source of income. \r\n\r\nTheir customers are located in many neighborhoods on the city, and on their shelves they find perfumes, cosmetics, beauty products, and costume jewelry. These arrive directly in the hands of their customers. Their neighbors are their main buyers and also many people who are employed. Abel and his wife offer easy credit that is adjusted to people\u2019s budgets so they can get the items they want. \r\n\r\nAbel is currently requesting a Kiva loan, his first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it he will buy a variety of merchandise directed especially toward women. Mother\u2019s Day is coming up and Abel and his wife want to have their inventory well stocked with what customers need at this time of year so they can sell and earn a little more money, taking advantage of the season. His goal to grow the business can\u2019t be stopped because they have as a family goal to travel to the United States and share that with their family. His main challenge is not having sufficient income to continually improve their wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1585632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise such as clothing, perfumes, colognes, footwear, and household items.

the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank in Chichicastenango, Guatemala. There are nine women in the group and, as their name suggests, the majority of them are seamstresses. The ladies, who are friends and neighbors, are beginning their second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. They are looking forward to improving their businesses and their quality of life.\r\n\r\nCatarina, a 22-year-old member of the Trust Bank, is the mother of a beautiful girl who is just over a year old. She is the joy of her mother\u2019s life! Catarina sews ornaments and trims to decorate typical blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d (pronounced \u201cwe-pee-les\u201d). She sells her work by the yard. As is the case with her fellow Trust Bank members, Catarina is beginning her second loan cycle. She plans to invest the loan in the purchase of fabrics and various colors of high quality thread. Her faithful and long time customers know that Catarina\u2019s work is of very high quality and so they return to her repeatedly for new orders.\r\n\r\nCatarina only reached the 6th grade and enjoys the monthly meetings with the Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. Besides making payments on their loans, the ladies participate in educational training sessions. A variety of topics are discussed, such as business and money management, women\u2019s identity, leadership and self-esteem, as well as children\u2019s and women\u2019s health and rights. With the knowledge that the women gain, they feel more empowered and able to manage their businesses and their lives more successfully. It is the combination of the loans and the educational trainings that Friendship Bridge calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nCatarina and the rest of the group are so appreciative and grateful that people from other parts of the world are interested in helping them help themselves. They look forward to a brighter future for themselves, their families and their community. Finally, they want KIVA investors to know that they send each person greetings from \u201cThe Land of Eternal

They are hardworking and have the collective goal of improving their own and their families' lives.\r\n\r\n Antonia is a 47-year-old member of the Trust Bank. Unfortunately, due to the lack of economic resources, she only attended school for one year. Along with her siblings, she was forced to work at an early age. Because of her efforts and dedication, Antonia learned many sewing techniques nine years ago. She began a textile business and now employs eight people from her community. She supplies them with thread, yarn and fabric and they transform these raw materials into napkins, tablecloths and aprons. Her husband is also involved in the business. Antonia is able to deliver 55-60 dozen items per week! Antonia is currently requesting a new loan, which she will use to purchase additional thread and fabric. She will use the proceeds to maintain and expand her current business with the ultimate goal of finding new customers in order to generate increased income. She wants to see each family involved in her business improve their standard of living with better food and more education for the children. Four of Antonia\u2019s six children are in school and she visualizes them attending college!\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the \u201cDios es Amor\u201d Trust Bank extend their heartfelt gratitude to KIVA investors for funding their loans.

associates and members from social groups in any community Esperanza serves this type of loan to help their communities. In this special loan, Maritza is representing her church in the community of Monte Plata. The church, Iglesia de Dios de Monte Plata, started this water project in order to provide purified water to the inhabitants of their community, delivering the service at a low price but with high quality and proper standards.\r\n\r\nThey want to use this loan to buy a truck to pick up and distribute the water to sellers and clients all over their community. They also want to restructure their distribution point where they sterilize gallons, fill bottles with purified water and deliver them to the neighbors that go directly to the business to buy them or sellers that distribute them. By \"improve,\" they mean to buy 5-gallon water bottles and labels, change system pieces, paint walls and other investments.\r\n\r\nMaritza is in change of the water project called Punto de Distribucion de Agua Monte Plata (Distribution Water Monte Plata). Approximately 35,000 people live in their neighborhood, and their plan is to distribute purified water to 2,000 families, at a cost of $0.50 US for a 5-gallon bottle of water. With this, Maritza said, they want to impact different areas: economic, health, spiritual and many others. This community, like others in the Dominican Republic, is an extremely poor area in Santo Domingo with many health problems, potable water scarcity, diseases, pollution, etc. This project plans to distribute these bottles to at least 2,000 families and businesses weekly. \r\n\r\nMaritza thanks God, Esperanza Internacional, and all of you for this opportunity.

This energetic lady is requesting a loan in order to increase her inventory and intends to purchase additional quantities of items for daily consumption including rice, beans, flour, oatmeal, noodles, coffee and drinks. When asked why she likes being a part of Friendship Bridge, Elena responded that she likes the non-formal educational trainings that a Loan Officer gives each month at the meetings. Relevant topics discussed include women\u2019s leadership, rights and identity, discrimination, self-esteem as well as nutrition, health and medicinal plants.\r\n\r\nThe women of the \u201cLa Esperanza\u201d Trust Bank appreciate the kindness and generosity of KIVA investors who provide capital for their loans. They face brighter and more successful tomorrows with their loans and education.

He earns a living there through his hardware store, a business he started four years ago after gaining over 25 years of experience as an employee at another store.  Taking advantage of his wife's being laid off at the business where she worked, he started this family business putting her aptitude for business to use.  His customers at the hardware store can find cinder blocks, paint, nails, cement, screws, and all kinds of construction accessories.  His main buyers are his neighbors, who guide Jorge's buying decisions with their orders.  He is currently applying for a Kiva loan, which will be his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, so he can buy nuts and bolts, doors, and home accessories.

Currently, she is applying for this loan from Kiva, her first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which she will use to buy a covering machine, as well as materials and other supplies. She needs these things so that she do the finishing on certain garments she makes and successfully work with fabrics that won't cooperate with industrial machines. This investment will help her reach success because she will save money on the costs of sending the garment out to be finished in other shops. Also, with the covering machine, she can earn additional income by providing services beyond what other seamstresses who don't have this kind of machine can provide."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1585714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy

This has been the experience of Jumrah who has a small kiosk business. Sometimes he has a lot of customers, but other times there are  quiet moments. The variation has certainly affected the revenue of his business and directly affected his repayments on his loan; however, Jumrah is very responsible with his obligations and was able to repay his loan. <br \/><br \/>In order to increase his income, Jumrah is taking on new loans.

He works from 6am to 4pm. \r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan in order to make home improvements.  The rainy season is coming and his home is in poor condition, meaning that he could have many leaks.

From the tantalizing aroma of a fresh hand-poured coffee to the social buzz found at local coffee shops, the full coffee experience has always excited them.  \r\n\r\nLast March they decided to finally take the plunge, quitting their jobs and emptying their 401Ks to open Broke Girl\u2019s Coffee Bar in the urban community of Normal Heights. The combination of eclectic d\u00e9cor, a large outdoor patio with a performance stage and locally sourced coffee beans make Broke Girls a San Diego gem worth discovering. However, what makes this caf\u00e9 truly special is its two owners with their contagious smiles and their deep care for the community.\r\n\r\nNow almost a year into operations, the caf\u00e9 has established itself as a community asset, with social and support groups meeting there regularly.  From leather-clad bikers to spoken word poets, those on the periphery have found a home within the art-covered walls and in the secluded back garden.  Operating on a shoestring budget and living an extremely modest lifestyle, Malakiah has kept her dream alive.  \r\n\r\nShe is now seeking some additional funding, in order to service her equipment, stock some of her popular items, and pay off some start-up debt which has now come current.  \r\n\r\nThe characteristics that are commonly seen in successful entrepreneurs can be found and felt upon walking into Malakiah\u2019s caf\u00e9.  Ceaseless optimism, a no excuses mentality, and a deep passion for her work, make her a magnetic figure in the community, and one worth supporting.  By boosting her up, you can be confident that you are also providing a gathering place for those often left unserviced.  As members of the sober community, their space provides a sanctuary for those on the path to recovery, and to those among us just looking for a great cup of coffee and a warm smile.

When he was in primary school, he helped his parents trading in one place and another.

He began his business after dropping out of school. Since then, he has been trading to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nDaniel would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL.

She is 36 years old and lives in the city of Bogot\u00e1.  When Claudia was 20 years old, a friend connected her with a sewing business where she learned how to make clothes.  At first, the work was very interesting since it was a new experience for her.  As the years passed, she gained a great deal of sewing experience.  Claudia currently has three children.  Her oldest child is 18 years old and she also has a 12-year-old and a 22-month-old.  The youngest child is a gift from God since her last pregnancy was unexpected.  At the end of her maternity leave, Claudia decided not to return to her sewing job since she was unable to find anyone to take care of her baby.  <br \/><br \/>One day her husband came up with an idea that seemed important at the time.  He suggested that she study something new and learn a trade in which she could be successful and help their family get ahead.  Claudia earned her high school diploma with great effort and then decided to follow through with her husband\u2019s idea by studying for a technical degree.   <br \/><br \/>She looked at several institutions that offered various options, but they were all too expensive for her budget.  Someone suggested that she look at CampoAlto and she was drawn to the Pharmacy Services Technician program.  Claudia is currently in her second semester, but now she must deal with the challenge of not being able to continue her studies.  The cost for this semester has increased and she does not have the funds that CampoAlto requires.  <br \/><br \/>Claudia says that she is participating in the Kiva program because she is very interested in continuing her studies.

The income generated by her husband is insufficient to cover all household expenses, so she initiated her business selling animals. She buys animals (baby goats & calves) at low prices, brings them up and sells them near the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha (a religious event in Muslims countries).

She has three animals. She has kept livestock in their farm yard for many years. Over time she has collected skill and experience in animal husbandry, and she'd like to apply her knowledge in this area to a business. She is starting her business in the buying and selling of cattle. Oimkhol will buy them at the Sharituz district market, and after fattening them, re-sell for a profit. To start this business she must have the funds to buy the animals. She decided to take out a loan and begin the business.
