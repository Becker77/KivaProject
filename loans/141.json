As her husband works full-time in Zamiin Uud, he is rarely at home. That's why she decided to pursue a small business by herself, instead of solely depending on her husband's salary. In 2005, she rented a small space and ran a small teashop. However, due to high rent, she decided to exit the teashop business. In 2009, she acquired a license to become an official distributor for a Russian company that sells health products extracted from bees' honey. Since she is the only one with the license in her town, she hopes to do well with the business. Since the start a few months earlier, her sales of health products have been doing considerably well. She says that she is working hard to introduce the honey products to locals and needs a personal computer to make marketing materials and purchase products online. She requests a loan to purchase a computer with Internet capabilities, with which she can do her own less costly marketing and order her products online.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\nFounded in 1998, XacBank is a community development bank and microfinance institution in Mongolia, and is headquartered in Ulaanbaatar.

She's thirty-four years old. In these difficult times, when jobs are scarce and even if one is found, the pay is hardly satisfactory, one of the most profitable jobs available to the average person is to become a salesman on the market. But in order for this to transpire a capital and entrepreneurial skills are required. The most valuable skill is, probably, the ability to take risks. Asiyam didn't wait for any changes or for outside help, but decided to start her own business. She could not afford to sit helplessly; her husband had to leave for Almaty City. Five years ago she approached a company specializing in microcrediting; received a loan, bought goods and started to sell clothes on the market. She could easily pick out the clothes that people would later buy from her, and so her business was successful. Her husband still works in Almaty City. Asiyam has three children: two girls and a boy. Her daughters are twelve and ten and her son is just three years old. Her daughters go to school and help look after their younger brother when they come home, which is considerable help for Asiyam. Her business is very successful even considering the recent decline in trade. She has been able to buy some livestock for her household and raise her families\u2019 quality of life. Right now her monthly income is about fifteen thousand soms ($350), whereas she had started her business with just five thousand soms ($116).

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling used clothing and shoe products (ukay-ukay). She also buys and sells assorted products such as toys, combs, needles and threads. Sabina has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 Sabina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sabina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Sabina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional stocks of used clothing. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Sabina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

de 18 a\u00f1os, es un joven empe\u00f1oso. Soltero y con planes claros para el futuro, vive en la casa de sus padres en la comunidad nativa San Pablo de Shaoriato. Desde que ten\u00eda 7 a\u00f1os ayudaba a sus padres en el campo, de esa manera aprendi\u00f3 sobre lo duro y gratificante que puede ser las jornadas.\nA sus 18 a\u00f1os ya cuenta con 2 lotes de terrenos de 20 por 15 metros cada uno. En ellos siembra kion y naranjas. Frutos que traslada hacia la ciudad de Pichanaki para su venta al por mayor inmediata, pues cuenta con compradores fijos. Pero deja una menor producci\u00f3n para expenderla al por menor.\n\u201cEl kilo de ki\u00f3n est\u00e1 a 1.50 soles y su cosecha es cada 7 u 8 meses, depende de los cuidados, abonamiento y limpieza\u201d, explica. Los suelos f\u00e9rtiles de su comunidad son propicios para el crecimiento y desarrollo de grandes y jugosos kiones. Adem\u00e1s los r\u00edos de la zona son cuna de card\u00famenes de peces. Rosendo caza y vende pescados como: \u201cChupadora\u201d \u201cBarb\u00f3n\u201d a los visitantes de su comunidad.  Este joven emprendedor prioriza su evoluci\u00f3n como persona, ampliando sus sembr\u00edos y mejorando la producci\u00f3n. Posteriormente tendr\u00e1 su familia, pero no est\u00e1 en sus planes cercanos. Ser\u00eda la primera vez que Rosendo acceder\u00eda a un cr\u00e9dito de MFP. Se siente contento de pertenecer a su banco comunal. Por esa raz\u00f3n, da su palabra de ser puntual en el pago de las cuotas y responsable con las actividades dentro del grupo. De obtener el pr\u00e9stamo, Rosendo invertir\u00e1 en el pago de operarios que trabajar\u00e1n sus terrenos, en el \u201cporcado\u201d (acumulaci\u00f3n de la tierra alrededor de la planta), y  deshierbo (limpieza de sembr\u00edos).\n\n","en":"Rosendo, 18, is a hard-working young man with clear plans for the future.  He is single, and lives in his parents home in his native village of San Pablo de Shariato.  Since he was 7 he helped his parents in the fields and thus learned how hard and gratifying daily work can be.\r\n\r\nAt 18 he has 2 fields of 20 and 15 meters each.  Here he plants kions (a ginger-like tuber) and oranges, fruits that he transports to Pichanaki to sell wholesale right away to regular buyers but he also keeps a small amount to sell retail.\r\nHe says,  \"The kilo of kion is 1.50 sols and his harvest is every 7 or 8 months, depending on the care, fertilizing and weeding\".  The fertile soil in his community is favorable to the growth and development of big and juicy kions.  Also the rivers in his area are thick with schools of fish.  Rosendo fishes and sells fish called: \"Chupadora\", and \"Baron\", to the people who come to his village.  This young entrepreneur prioritizes his development as a person, increasing his planting and improving his production.  In the future he will have a family but this is not in his plans at the moment.  This will be the first time that Rosendo requests a loan with MFP.  He feels happy to belong to the communal bank.  Thus, he promises to be punctual in making the payments and responsible in the activities of the group.  He will use the loan to pay the people who work his fields, in the \u201cporcado\u201d (forming dirt around the plants) and in weeding (cleaning the crops).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":919267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is requesting PHP 5,000.00 as start-up capital for his business. His wife will manage the store. \r\n\r\nRoderick has a job at the Municipal Nursery.  He is thankful that he has additional income for his family and that his wife will be having fun managing their business. In the future, Roderick hopes to expand his sari-sari to a mini grocery store and to have a house of their own for his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":277259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies for his store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calamba-Mapang, Rizal Zamboanga Del Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2009-02-23T05:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roderick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27124347},{"amount":45.14,"local_amount":1805.68,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2180.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36019729},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52998520},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63219989},{"amount":17.31,"local_amount":692.32,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":835.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73710007}],"funded_date":"2009-02-23T06:00:49Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T20:19:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":95334,"name":"Nikolay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nikolay is married with one son.

He hopes to have more children some day.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":435118,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1460,"youtubeId":"6aPUGhkXr0M","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Omar Antonia  from  Nicaragua","thumbnailImageId":435118},"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy motorcycle parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2009-11-27T05:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Omar Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":652.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":672.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":692.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":713.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":734.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":756.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":779.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.6},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.72},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.63,"local_amount":652.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":676.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110661411},{"amount":33.6,"local_amount":672.11,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":696.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118057057},{"amount":34.62,"local_amount":692.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":717.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123892055},{"amount":35.65,"local_amount":713.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":739.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128925718},{"amount":36.72,"local_amount":734.43,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136653301},{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":756.46,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":784.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144685995},{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":779.16,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:34:37Z","rounded_local_amount":807.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151869737}],"funded_date":"2009-11-27T15:17:19Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:34:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"N Aviva","image":null}},{"id":161121,"name":"Rosa Cacilda","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Rosa Cacilda D. nasceu na cidade da Matola, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, tem 52 anos de idade, separada e m\u00e3e de 5 filhos de 29, 27, 24, 21 e 10 anos de idade todos v\u00e3o a escola.

She is 52 years old, divorced and the mother of 5 children. Her children are 29, 27, 24, 21, and 10 years old and they are all in school. She went to school until the 5th grade and didn't continue because her parents could not afford her to. She lives in her own house with her children and six grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1975, she left Matola to live in the Patrice Lumumba neighborhood. In 1996, she separated from her husband and settled in Boane where she currently lives with her children. She has her own business in her backyard. She works from 7am to 10pm, depending on the flow of customers. She started this activity in 1985 due to a number of hardships she has faced in her day to day life. She does not have any employees and has an income of around 5.000.00mt per month which goes toward household expenses and savings in Xitique, a traditional rotational savings system. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks. She discovered Hluvuku through neighbors who are also members. This will be her fourth loan. She requests 15.000.00mt to buy building materials (cement, stones, sand and iron) to increase the size of her house. The previous loans were for 5.000.00mt, 10.000.00mt and 13.600.00mt and were all used for the same activity. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she would like to request more loans to finish her construction

She earns her living by operating a rice retailing business. Her husband Jeremias C., age 53, earns a living as a construction worker and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 16 to 25 years old. \r\n\r\nAida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP; thus, improving the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP to buy more rice. She will use the profits to meet basic everyday needs as well as allowance for the kids to go to school and for medicine for her sick mother-in-law. All the while, she is trying her best to continue to save up for the future. Aida C. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

S. is 38 years old, widowed and has 2 children ages 13 and 6 years old, whom he hopes to give good education to the university level. \r\n\r\nRonald is a charcoal dealer in Mombasa. Mombasa is along the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, particularly the Indian ocean white beaches. Ronald has been selling charcoal for the last 2 years to the local people and has managed to give employment to 2 people. He says that this business is profitable, but the major challenge he has is there are so many people in the same kind of business as his in the area, so customers are spoiled for choice.

She is married to Edgar, a security guard, and mother to their three children. The eldest is already in college while the youngest is still in elementary school. She, together with her husband and children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmily operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmily hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":865538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"    To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-10T14:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3519.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764621},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2815.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571742},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2815.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529292},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1407.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738512}],"funded_date":"2011-09-11T19:34:29Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":337948,"name":"Marlyn","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marlyn desde Pradomar,cerca a las Payas en el municipio de Puerto Colombia, da las gracias a sus financiadores por apoyar tantos negocios peque\u00f1os en el mundo; ella est\u00e1 prepar\u00e1ndose para su segundo credikiva, porque va a comprar ingredientes para elaborar sus productos como harina de trigo, aceite , az\u00facar, margarina, carnes fr\u00edas, desechables y bandejas, as\u00ed mismo comprar\u00e1 un molino el\u00e9ctrico de ma\u00edz y har\u00e1 algunas reformas locativas al sal\u00f3n de producci\u00f3n.

Four of her older children (2 boys and 2 girls) are working away from home and rarely visit, leaving her to take care of the family and all the housework on her own.  Mrs. T. starts loaning money in 1998 with the starting amount of $50 to invest in her butchery business.  After her four children grew up and left home, without any one to help out, she had to change to fish-farming and raising pigs.  Her husband, Mr. Tran Minh Quy, is a disable war veteran but has helped her a lot in both of these businesses.  On average, for every farrow of pig she sells (usually once in every 3 months) she earns a profit of $150.  Currently, Mrs T. is asking for a loan of $825 to invest in her home projects.  This amount of money will be used to buy breeding fish (for $312), breeding pig (for $200) and foodstuff for them (for $312).\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh Hoai Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft, 55 tu\u1ed5i s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng v\u1edbi ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 c\u00f4 con g\u00e1i nu\u00f4i t\u1ea1i x\u00e3 H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, huy\u1ec7n H\u01b0ng Nguy\u00ean, Ngh\u1ec7 An. 4 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con l\u1edbn g\u1ed3m 2 trai, 2 g\u00e1i \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111i l\u00e0m \u0103n xa \u00edt c\u00f3 d\u1ecbp v\u1ec1 th\u0103m cha m\u1eb9, ch\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft m\u1ed9t m\u00ecnh ch\u0103m lo h\u1ea7u h\u1ebft c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c trong gia \u0111\u00ecnh.

This is a very traditional town. Here, one can find the women walking through the streets wearing their traditional outfits and speaking Quiche, a Mayan language. The people from Santa Clara are friendly people and are respectful T. strangers. \r\n<p>Santa Clara is passing through an important time, especially for the women. For the last few years, the women in the community are being recognized as independent people that can make important economic decisions and be responsible for them. This attitude opens more doors for microfinance.\r\n<p> The members of Claritas are a group of incredible and warm women. They meet three times a week T. carry out their financial transactions with The Friendship Bridge. \r\n<p>The Claritas Group has been recognized by The Friendship Bridge as excellent clients. They continue working with a project for years, always repaying punctually and standing out as leaders within their communal banks. The success of this group is based on the fact that all of the members are very responsible and that they have confidence in each other. The members maintain that the money they earn is not T. be spent, but is T. be invested because only then will they get returns and generate profits. \r\n<p>Many of the clients that work in this communal bank invest their loan inT. bakeries. Santa Clara is known for the delicious bread that it produces. Some of the women make bread in their homes, then they bring the bread T. a neighboring village, San Juan la Laguna, and they sell it there. The interesting thing is that they put the bread inT. baskets that they carry on their heads and will sell it from house T. house! Other women work in the production of beaded belts. Also, there is a member who bought a dressmaking machine with her loans. Finally, there is a woman that breeds animals, such as chickens and pigs, for sale. \r\n<p>This is a special group, and we should accompany them on their journey and support them. With your support, you will be able T. give them the opportunity T. improve their lives. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A. Shah, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las Claritas provienen de un bello pueblo que est\u00e1 ubicado en las monta\u00f1as que rodean el m\u00e1gico lago de Atitl\u00e1n. Este pueblo es muy tradicional. En este se puede encontrar a todas las mujeres caminando por las calles vistiendo sus trajes tradicionales y hablando el maya- Quiche. Un aspecT. muy bueno de los Santa Clare\u00f1os es que son gente amigables y respetuosos con los extranjeros. \r\n\r\n<P>Santa Clara est\u00e1 pasando por un momenT. importante, especialmente para las mujeres. Desde hace unos a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, las mujeres dentro de la comunidad, est\u00e1n siendo reconocidas como personas indepedientes que pueden tomar decisiones econ\u00f3micas importantes y ser responsable de ellas. Para nuestro beneficio esa actitud le abre m\u00e1s puertas al micro- cr\u00e9diT..  \r\n\r\n<P>Las Claritas son un grupo de mujeres incre\u00edbles, en lo personal me qued\u00e9 impresionado cuando entr\u00e9 al cuarT. donde este grupo de se\u00f1oras se reunen tres veces por semana para efectuar sus transacciones financieras con The Friendship Bridge. Desde que llegu\u00e9 al cuarT. ellas fueron muy c\u00e1lidas conmigo, fue una experiencia muy agradable. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Claritas han sido reconocidas por The Friendship Bridge como clientas de excelencia. Ellas llevan trabajando con el proyecT. por a\u00f1os, siempre pagando puntualmente y destac\u00e1ndose como lideres dentro de sus bancos comunales. El \u00e9xiT. de este grupo se base en que todas las clientes son muy responsables y se tienen confianza entre ellas.  Durante la reuni\u00f3n le pregunte a una cliente sobre sus decisiones con respecT. al dinero y ella respondi\u00f3 que \u201cel dinero no se gasta, solo se invierte porque sino no da vuelta y no se genera ganancia\u201d\r\n\r\n<P>Un gran n\u00famero de clientas que trabajan en este banco comunal invierten su cr\u00e9diT. en panader\u00edas. Santa Clara es conocido por el delicioso pan que produce. Algunas de las se\u00f1oras producen el pan en sus casas, luego se lo llevan en un carro a la aldea aleda\u00f1a, San Juan la Laguna, y lo van a vender ah\u00ed. Lo interesante es que ponen el pan en canastos que lo cargan en la cabeza y van a vender de casa en casa! Otras se\u00f1oras trabajan en la elaboraci\u00f3n de fajas de mostacilla. Tambi\u00e9n hay una clienta que con sus pr\u00e9stamos se pudo comprar una m\u00e1quina de confecci\u00f3n. Finalmente, hay una se\u00f1ora que cr\u00eda animales, pollos y cerdos para su venta. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo es especial y creo que debemos acompa\u00f1arlos y apoyarlos, y ustedes con su apoyo van a poder darle la oportunidad de superarse."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":185960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is living with her mother who helps her with her business, a restaurant.  She used to be a farmer but she gave it up because the seasons were not profitable enough. Since then, she has prepared food for people traveling over the Paucartambo bridge. Her mother helps her with the daily duties which include making breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They wake up at 4:00 a.m., go to bed at 11:00 p.m. and are very tired when their day ends. One of the biggest difficulties is the rise in cost of chicken because if they raised the menu prices, they would have no customers and would be left with the extra meals. Consequently, they only prepare 10 to 20 plates per day, earning back 50% of their investment. As a single woman, Hedy has to work in order to provide food and clothing to her daughter, and to offer her a prosperous future that includes the necessities for an education.

She is married but has no children. She lives with her husband in her matrimonial home in Abofour, a suburb of Offinso in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Victoria is an achiever and a resourceful woman. She loves selling goods, the business through which she makes a living. <p>\r\n\r\nVictoria has traded in bananas in Abofour market for more than 20 years. She treks to surrounding villages in the central part of Ghana to purchase bulk stocks of bananas from the farmers and retails them to her customers. For lack of adequate working capital, she is not able to pick enough stock to make enough profit to support her family. Victoria will buy the unripe bananas in bulk, and she will cover them with plantain leaves in the bush. She leaves them for a while so when they are ripe she will sell them to her customers.   <p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she wants to purchase bulk supplies of bananas to enable her to scale up her sales.

Erika vende todas las ma\u00f1anas y todos los d\u00edas de la semana, sus clientes son principalmente obreros y viajeros  que  se detienen en el lugar. Con el paso de los a\u00f1os Erika ha visto la creciente  demanda de su comida, y eso garantiza que tenga ganancias de su trabajo. Cada 15 d\u00edas compra al por mayor sus ingredientes, para ello viaja a la ciudad de Lima para que sea menor su inversi\u00f3n. Para el futuro, Erika tiene grandes proyecciones para su negocio, quiere agrandar su carrito de ventas y tener otro puesto. Es la segunda vez que participa en un banco comunal, el cual sufri\u00f3 dificultades, pero que ya se han superado, ella se siente orgullosa de ser parte de la soluci\u00f3n y no del problema.

She started selling with a large bucket and glasses.  Now she has a cart which allows her to transport her breakfasts.  Erika sells every morning and every day of the week.  Her customers are primarily workers and travelers who stop in the area.  \r\n\r\nAs the years have passed Erika has seen the demand for her food grow.  This guarantees that she will have earnings from her work.  Every 15 days she buys her ingredients wholesale.  To do this she travels to Lima in order to spend less.  \r\n \r\n\r\nIn the future Erika has big plans for her business.  She wants to enlarge her cart and have another stand.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second time that she has participated in a community bank.  The bank had problems, but they overcome them.  She is proud to be part of the solution and not the problem.  With the loan she will buy supplies to use in the preparation of the breakfasts.  She will buy sacks of quinua and maca (grains); oil drums; and a canister of gas to use while cooking.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":297883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy ingredients for her meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-04T16:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012372},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595960},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990224},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211349},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640862},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080331},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":257.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996531},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":257.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842028}],"funded_date":"2009-04-06T15:34:48Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":103542,"name":"Awa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Awa G., 37 ans, est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 4 enfants.

She is 38 years old. Letecia is married and has five school-age children. To make a living, Letecia owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing transportation services to local community members. Letecia has been engaged in her business for over five years, and she earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Letecia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Letecia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business. Letecia is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase another transport vehicle for the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Letecia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support her immediate family members. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

By keeping inventory high and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.

Generally, husbands who have several wives tend to neglect their role as fathers because they are weighted down by too much responsibility for supporting their households. It is thus the women who eke out a living for their children, feeding, clothing, and educating them. Such is the situation that Mrs. D. finds herself in. <P>Fortunately for her children, Essi is a dynamic woman with lots of business activities. Currently, she has opened up a little telephone stand, together with selling shoes and various other products. In order to expand these micro-businesses, Essi is asking for a loan of US$ 1000 which will serve her as business capital. This will allow her to increase her profit and improve living conditions for her family.<P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Ag\u00e9e de 28 ans, Madame D.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.  Tajikistan is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<br>\r\nIMON's History:\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started this business after she separated from her husband and has already been selling tamales and humitas for eight months.  Emma sells her products at the market near her neighborhood and occasionally in places where folkloric performances are held.  Sometimes she accepts orders since her food sells well among her loyal customers.  She is motivated by her business, but finds it difficult to grind the corn using her outdated machine.  Her greatest wish is to expand her business and also attract more customers.  Afterwards, she plans to buy electrical appliances to help improve her business.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.

She has two years of experience in this business.  Kapeneta needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nIn 2010, Kapeneta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Kapeneta's second loan with SPBD. \n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

However, since there was policy allowing people to exchange the rice field for other-purpose land, she bravely invested money and effort in transforming the land into the fish ponds and orchards. Her family income from the fish ponds in 2007 was approximately 3000 USD. Currently, her family is working on 3 rice fields, 4 fish ponds. Therefore, she is very busy at this time. However, she still manages to find some spare time to join activities of the area. She is elected to be the head of her living area.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase maize, beans and rice.

He has dedicated himself to the agriculture industry since he was very young, has acquired experience and in this way is able to maintain his family. Today this gentleman needs to promptly acquire the economic resources to buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for planting wheat, watermelon and onion. This was Farakh's motive for coming to IMON International to obtain the loan necessary for the purchase so that he can continue caring for his humble family that really needs his support.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Moinposho is an enterprising woman with a big desire to improve the quality of life for her family. She is married and the mother of three children. Moinposho has been a seamstress since she was very young, learning in her mother's office. She was able to open her own shop at her home 13 years ago and has been successful because her customers have recognized the high quality of her products. In this way, she constantly adds new clients and has seen her business grow. Today Moinposho is applying for a loan to IMON International for the seventh time. She is requesting 4000 Somoni that she will spend to purchase summer fabrics for sewing national dresses. You can help improve the quality of life of Moinposho\u2019s family. She sincerely appreciates your support and thanks you!   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This area is characterized by its people working in agriculture, livestock, and tourism.\r\n\r\nPercy has been working for the last year raising and selling pigs. His farmyard is in the rear of his house, and he feeds them a balanced animal feed.  Once they are fully grown to their optimum size, he offers them for sale to his customers, or to the various markets in Chiclayo and Lambayeque, and with the income he earns he is able to cover his personal expenses.\r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 1,500 New Soles from Edpyme Alternativa to buy more animals and their feed, so that they can be well fed and he can offer them for sale to his customers for a better price.  His end-goal is to generate more income so he can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nPercy is a hard-working and very responsible person; the only thing he wants is to get ahead in life, and to continue helping his parents with whatever they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":865635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animals and their feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"T\u00facume -

She joined One Acre Fund in order to have additional maize profits to educate her children and access fertilizer and hybrid seeds for food security.

Before joining One Acre Fund, Roselyne was only able to harvest seven bags of maize on one acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Roselyne and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Roselyne will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Bidii Women group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nShe is pictured with her group members in the photograph.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":906582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-11T04:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":21700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":21700,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":21825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680637}],"funded_date":"2011-11-11T13:53:30Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}}]}
