This is 39-year-old Precious Tutsirayi Tsitsi from Harare. She is married with three children, and two are attending school. She also cares for two other dependents. Precious Tutsirayi Tsitsi runs a retail business selling kitchenware, clothing and hair products. The business has been in operation for 4 years. \r\n\r\nShe says the main challenges faced are capital constraints and the general non-performing economy.

He was the third of five siblings and his parents did not believe in schooling. They believed that only through work could he get ahead. Because of their extreme poverty, he had to help his parents work.  He is married and his wife takes care of the home. They have three children, two of which are living with him and the other, already married, so he has two dependents.\r\n\r\nTomas works in agriculture and has done so all his life.  As a child, his father taught him to work in agriculture. Apart from farming, he works at a canal which generates extra money month. He goes at 5 in the morning to the canal and leaves at 11 am.  He has only lunch and then travels about five miles by bicycle to his corn crop to start work, accompanied by his son who helps him.  It's hard to tell what time he leaves as he works until he finishes doing what he needs done before going home.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in preparing the land where he will work, buying the supplies he needs for his crop, and buying a cow.  It is worth mentioning that with the extra money he already has and loan it to complement, this is what he plans do this year.\r\n\r\nTomas dreams of having a better house than they have right now, to help his children, and to have a vehicle to transport his family in those few moments of rest. He knows it's a big challenge but with God's help and his effort, it may be possible.

Like many Colombians, it falls to him to forge his path with effort and patience.  It is very clear to him that sometimes life does not smile on everyone.  However, it is clearer to him that this is no reason to lose heart and be taken over by the bad situation.  \r\n\r\nHis best-known phrase is that intelligent men come out of the worst moments.  Perhaps this sentence does not make sense, or only he understands it.  He explains it very simply.  The only thing it means to say is that the most intelligent solutions come from the worst situations.  That is how he got into the world of micro-finance.  He did it in order to start his place of renting entertainment.  It is a place where children are able to distract themselves by playing video games.  With the business he has managed to grow and to cover all of his expenses.\r\n\r\nHe now needs monetary help in order to maintain and adapt the place.  With his first loan he managed to set up the business.  What he is seeking is to make it attractive and so that it has equipment that functions optimally.\r\n\r\nThis single man\u2019s big dream is to find a life partner with whom he is able to tend to the

He is married and the father of one child.  This is the first time he is reaching out to MDO Arvand, and he decided to do so when he heard about the possibility of receiving financial support.  Firdavs lives with his family in a rural setting.  He never received a higher education, as his family was not in a position to send him to a university.  The same goes for Firdavs' wife, who did not receive an education either.  She works as a homemaker taking care of the household and raising their child. \r\n\r\nFirdavs supports his family by running his own business, which consists in fattening and selling cattle.  In addition to this activity, he also works as a repairman on construction sites.  He makes a good income from his business, and his wife helps him by selling the milk they obtain from their cattle.  Firdavs is now planning to increase his cattle headcount and expand his business.  With this goal in mind, he has contacted MDO Arvand and requested a loan to buy some cattle.  He is looking forward to a positive outcome and thanks MDO Arvand in advance for its support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1571390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase some livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-26T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-26T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Firdavs ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":193.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":199.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":205.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":212.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":219.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":226.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":233.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":240.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":248.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":256.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":265.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2532.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875703}],"funded_date":"2014-05-23T04:27:04Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":701880,"name":"Mary Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jean, 44 years old, is married and has two children, both in school.

He lives with his wife and their children as a traditional family. They reside in Medine, one of the popular neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso, in the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali.\r\n\r\nMister Almoudou did not get the opportunity to continue school, and instead was initiated into sewing by his uncle at a young age, over thirty years ago. His workshop is located in Sikasso\u2019s great market. Most of his clientele is male, with many fair merchants. With such a long experience in his domain, he enjoys the complete trust from his profession, which earned him the presidency of the Surveillance Committee of the Sikasso Tailors\u2019 Association (A.T.S.). In addition to tailoring, he purchases sewing machines in Lome (Republic of Togo) and men\u2019s fabrics that he retails cash or credit to other Sikasso tailors.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the ever-growing demand, he is requesting this seventh loan from micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This seventh individual loan will allow him to purchase twelve sewing machines and twenty pieces of fabric.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he is planning on a monthly profit of 150,000 XOF. With the profit, he will pay for his personal expenses, contribute to the family\u2019s expenses, pay the loan interests, and reinvest in his

This is 44-year-old Miriam from Harare. She is married with one child who attends school. She also cares for two other dependants. Miriam runs a retail business selling clothing items for men, women and kids. The business has been in operation for four years. She says the main challenges faced are limited access to working capital and a lack of variety in her products.

She earns her living through a restaurant in her house. \r\n\r\nShe learned everything she knows about cooking from her mother. Now, she runs a humble restaurant which may not be the most well-visited, but according to the charismatic Tania, it's the one with the best flavor.\r\n\r\nBecause of her young age, Tania does't have much experience. Worse still, the violence that has swept around her been a factor against business growth, so much so that she's thought about moving her home and looking for new horizons, starting a new life from zero.\r\n\r\nHowever, the determination and character of this young woman, which is absent in many people, allowed her to continue with her humble business.

She is a very solitary person. Her only companions are her chickens, which she has fed for these last few years, since her business is marketing and selling them. Her personal life has been a shambles, since her only son is already an adult who has his own obligations in his household, and she is separated from her husband. She has worked in this business all her life. Now life is smiling on her, since her sales are improving. Every day her chickens are more sought after by more customers, and for this reason she can indulge in thinking of modifications and expanding her business. She is applying for financial help to purchase chickens and expand her sheds, with which she hopes to increase her sales and give herself a better quality of life, and above all demonstrate that it

For the past ten years she has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture.  She started in this business with a capital of 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she has greatly developed her farming business and her monthly income now comes close to 10,000 som (KGS).  She now owns four dairy cows and 10 sheep and also cultivates 1.2 hectare of land on which she grows melons, cucumbers and watermelons.  All the members of her family actively help her to run the farm. Eager to further develop her farming business, Ayshakan has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 30,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy mineral fertilizers as well as high quality seeds to cultivate her land.  She plans to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further expanding her small business.  In the future she would also like to buy more cattle for breeding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1589735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

and cheerful man of 37.  He is married and has children, and puts his whole soul into his work.  Askar lives with his wife in a small home in a rural village, and runs his business in order to feed his family.  He works in animal husbandry and has a plot of land, part of which is fed by rain water, and part of which is irrigated.  On this plot of land Askar grows carrots, potatoes, and grain, and his wife helps him care for and raise cattle. Because they have a large plot of land, they also have the cattle graze on their land.

hardworking and cheerful man of 63.  He is married and has four children.  All of his children are grown and have their own families.  Abdurahmon lives with his wife in a small village, and they have a small home.  Abdurahomn is full of strength and energy, no matter what his age.  He never complains about his health because he is always active and engaged in physical work.  Abdurahmon works as a truck driver, and transports people as well as small cargo.  He has been working in this job for 20 years.  Abdurahmon's children also have their own businesses, and help out their parents.  One of Abdurahmon's sons has a small pharmacy.  Abdurahomn hopes to redo his truck so that he will be able to continue working.  He doesn't have enough money, however, to purchase the necessary parts.  For this reason, Abdurahmon turned to Arvand, and hopes to receive a loan to buy parts for his truck.  He thanks Arvand in advance for its

Burma has a secondary education - she knows how to plan and use money for the purpose of achieving goals.  Burma's work in animal husbandry, beginning in 1994 with the purchase of cattle for 3,000 KGS, serves as the primary source of income for her family.  Thanks to Burma's hard work, she now has 2 milk cows and grows potatoes and carrots on 0.70 hectares of land, while also running a sewing business out of her home.  Her total monthly income is more than 10,000 KGS.  She has all of the necessities, including a sufficient amount of hay and feed saved up, for taking care of cattle.  With the goal of further expanding her business, Burma turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase top of the line potato seeds and fertilizer, which will help her increase productivity and the fertility of her soil, and which will also help her expand her sewing business.  With the money earned from her loan, Burma plans to save toward further increasing the size of her herd, and hopes to save towards building a house for her daughter."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1589917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy potato seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Shak-Shak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-27T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-27T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50338.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513516}],"funded_date":"2014-05-06T14:37:57Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":698796,"name":"Bacilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Basilia, tiene 42 a\u00f1os   ella se dedica a vender en un mercado cerca de su casa vende por las ma\u00f1anas empanadas de queso,   este pr\u00e9stamo es su primera secuencia dentro de la instituci\u00f3n,  La se\u00f1ora Basilia va a usar este pr\u00e9stamo de  para la compra de material de construcci\u00f3n para hacer construir su casita, La se\u00f1ora Basilia enfrenta retos en su negocio que son la falta de capital ya que ella se encuentra en mercado que va creciendo.

He works repairing houses, but only earns a small salary.  For this reason he decided to start his own business, which will provide him with a good income.  He is planning to buy a welding machine and to use it to make a profit.  This machine is in high demand, especially in a village, where things are constantly in need of being built.  Taburjon thus turned to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to buy a welding machine.  He believes that, with the help of Arvard and Kiva, he can improve the financial situation of his family.

Her children are grown and independent - her daughter lives by herself and her son lives in Russia for work.  Bashorathon has a higher education; she finished teaching school and worked for many years in the local school.  Beginning in 1998 with 10,000 KGS, she also started working in farming and animal husbandry.  Thanks to hard work, Bashorathon now has 0.35 hectares of her own land and 0.50 hectares of rented land on which she raises potatoes and corn to eat and to sell.  Her monthly income is 20,000 KGS.  With the goal of further expanding her business, Bashorathon turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase high quality cucumber and tomato seeds, and also to buy steers.  Bashorathon will have a good harvest, which will certainly improve her family's capital.  With the income from her loan, Bashorathon hopes to invest in increasing the size of her herd, and plans to save towards building a greenhouse.

She has all of the necessities to start and run this business in her region of Qubadiyon.  Near her home are several pastures, and she has also stocked up on dry cattle feed.  She does not, however, have sufficient capital to buy cattle.  She needs to borrow money, and for that reason is asking for a loan.  With money from the loan, Zainab plans to buy 15 head of horned cattle to start a new business and provide a new source of income for her family.

She is a happily married mother of two children, ages 4 and 1. She is very grateful for the support she has received from Kiva over the last year in growing her money transfer business. \r\n\r\nLast year, Angelina accessed a Kiva loan that allowed her to increase her working capital. This enabled her to serve more customers from her shop. \r\n\r\nAngelina is very happy with her business. She has managed to expand the business by opening two more Zoona mobile money transfer outlets throughout the country. She has also employed two more people to work at her shops. \r\n\r\nAngelina, a nurse by profession, enjoys her business because she is able to offer financial services to the community and employ young people who are straight from high school. She says most of the people she employs are trying to raise money for their college tuition, and jobs for youth in her community are very difficlut to find. \r\n\r\nAngelina is requesting a second Kiva loan to purchase a trading booth for a third mobile money outlet that she wants to open. This loan will also be used as working capital to serve customers at her new shop. Running her business empowers Angelina to provide for her family and pay for their housing.

Medelkan has a secondary education.  Medelkan's work in animal husbandry, beginning in 1990 with 5,000 KGS, serves as the primary source of income for her family.  Thanks to the purposefulness and hard work of Medelkan, she now has 6 milk cows and 2 calves, from which she obtains milk to sell.  Her monthly income is about 10,000 KGS.

Muhtabar has a secondary education.  Muhtabar's word in animal husbandry and farming, beginning in 1974, serves as the family's primary source of income.  Thanks to Muhtabar's hard work, she now has 1 milk cow, 5 horses, and 20 sheep.  She also has a 1.20 hectare plot of land, on which Muhtabar raises beans and clover for eating and for sale.  Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS.  With the goal of further expanding her business, Muhtabar turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase cows to increase the size of her herd.  She also wants to buy seeds and nitrates.  With the income she earns from the loan Muhtabar plans to save towards further increasing the size of her herd and hopes to save toward enlarging her

Meet Roda, 69, a hardworking entrepreneur running a mixed farming business on her five-acre piece of land in the North Rift Valley region of Eldoret, home to some of the world's finest marathon runners. After her husband passed on, she really values visits from her independent daughter who is the apple of Roda's eye.<br \/><br \/>Roda enjoys the beauty and health of her environmental surroundings as much as she does about raising dairy cows. She is constantly planting trees and cultivates a wide variety of flowers. When you visit her farm, you will notice various works of art within and around her home.<br \/><br \/>This will be Roda's fourth loan from Juhudi! She has always repaid on time. Roda gets by selling the milk her cattle produce. She is deeply passionate about dairy farming, and is so appreciative of the microfinance that helped her first empower herself to become an entrepreneur that she named her cows Juhudi and Juhudi Kilimo. Recently, however, one of the cows accidentally stepped into a pit and injured her leg while being led to pasture. Roda is devastated but remains optimistic and is hopeful that Juhudi will walk again soon.<br \/><br \/>Today, Roda is now in need of two additional cows to maximize use of her pasture. In the past, she has successfully serviced Juhudi Kilimo loans on time and is now requesting a new loan.<br \/><br \/>With your loan, Roda will sustain and improve her agricultural business activities. With the increased income, she dreams of saving enough to provide a secure future for her grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1592381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married and has three children.  Zulfiya loves her family very much, especially her children.  She and her husband work and save money to provide for all of the needs of their family.  She wants her children to get a good education and become educated people.  Zulfiya works as a seamstress in a sewing shop.  She learned this profession when she was young and knows all of the intricacies of this work.  Zulfiya's husband works abroad, and sends money home to his family every month.  Zulfiya's eldest son now wants to travel to his father to help him in his work and to earn more money.  For this to happen he needs to purchase a ticket and all other necessities for the trip.  Zulfiya thus turned to Arvand and is hoping to receive a loan to buy a ticket for her son.  She is hoping for a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for its

children.  She considers the well-being of her family and children to be of the highest value in her life.  In 2005, with a starting capital of 25,000 KGS, she began a business selling women's clothing.  Because of her ability to develop her business and gain loyal customers, Nuriza has an average monthly income of about 30,000 KGS.  Thanks to Nuriza's hard work in her business, she was able to increase turnover and grow her business.  With the goal of further increasing and expanding her business, Nuriza turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 80,000 KGS to increase business, and in particular to buy clothing.  With the income from the loan, Nuriza plans to invest in increasing the size of her store and save towards her children's

years old, widowed, and the mother of 2 children.  Chynar has a secondary education, and knows how to use financial resources to work toward accomplishing set goals.  Chynar's 14 years of work in animal husbandry has served as the main source of income for her family.  She now has 3 milk cows, 20 sheep, and 2 horses.  She has all the necessities for taking care of cattle, including feed and hay.  Her monthly income is about 10,000 KGS.  With the goal of further increasing her business, Chynar turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 30,000 KGS to purchase cows to breed, and to increase her monthly income from selling milk products.  With the income from the loan, she plans to invest in further increasing the size of her herd, and also plans to save towards building a house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1590851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He is married and has two children.  He first turned to Arvand when he found out that there was a chance to receive financial support.  Saidjon lives with his family in a rural area.  He does not have a higher education because the financial troubles of his family precluded him from studying in university.  His wife also does not have an education and is a homemaker, taking care of household chores and raising the children.  To have money for food, Saidjon has his own business fattening and selling cattle.  Saidjon also works repairing houses and apartments, which provides him with a good income.  His wife also helps Saidjon in his work by selling milk from their cattle.  Saidjon now hopes to expand his business by increasing the number of cattle in his herd.  He thus turned to Arvand in the hopes of receiving a loan to purchase cattle.  Saidjon is very hopeful that there will be a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1588929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saidjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.1,"local_amount":72.1,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":72.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875707},{"amount":73.9,"local_amount":73.9,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":73.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302931},{"amount":75.74,"local_amount":75.74,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":75.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585730},{"amount":77.62,"local_amount":77.62,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":77.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081313},{"amount":700.64,"local_amount":700.64,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":700.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562191}],"funded_date":"2014-05-08T11:05:27Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":702024,"name":"St Thereza Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex is a thirty-nine-year old married male living in Kasese-Uganda, with four children of whom three go to school.

The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cChuisequec\u201d consisting of eleven women is found here. The ladies create traditional crafts, jewellery, and beaded items in order to create income.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Rosario is a 37-year-old member of the Trust Bank who is a true leader and role model for the group. She has been elected President. She is very charismatic and promotes harmony within the Trust Bank. This hard-working woman, who is married with seven children, is involved with her family farm growing carrots, onions, and cabbage. She is requesting a new loan which she will invest in the onion crop that she will plant in the winter months. Right now, she has to prepare the soil and buy fertilizer, insecticides, and seeds. She wants to have everything ready so that she can have an excellent and abundant harvest.\r\n\r\nThe eleven women are greatly helped by the non-formal educational themes that are covered by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer at the monthly meetings on topics like money management and business administration, budgeting, and accounting, as well as health and nutrition. Many of them, like Do\u00f1a Rosario, have had little or no formal education. But they realize that education is the key to a successful future. Four of Do\u00f1a Rosario\u2019s children attend elementary school and she is quite pleased about this. \r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank \u201cChuisequec\u201d send their appreciation and gratitude to Kiva investors for believing in their dreams. Armed with their newly acquired knowledge and loans, the ladies are able to improve the quality of their lives and empower themselves with the final goal of eliminating poverty. This will not only benefit themselves but also their families and their community.

She used the previous loans all of which paid back successfully to restock her business with the products that were most in demand so that her business could grow. Her business now is doing great and thanks goes to Kiva lenders who did this. She got a profit which she used to cover school fees and home food expenses. Tetula drams that after three years, she will be able to be a wholesaler of her products. She will use this loan to buy stock to resell wholesale. \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group\" Karibea\" which totals two members.

She has a high school education and is a very responsible, sociable and cheerful person. Bermethan works in animal husbandry and agriculture, a business she began 14 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has four milking cows and three calves, with a monthly income of over 10,000 KGS from the sales of milk and dairy products, as well as 0.78 hectares of land on which she grows primarily melon, corn and watermelon. The resulting harvest is sold to wholesale suppliers. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Bermethan has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase mineral fertilizers and high-quality seeds. She plans to prepare for the spring and summer growing season, improve the quality of the soil and receive a large harvest. She wants to invest profits from the loan into further improving the amount of livestock she has, and to save toward purchasing furniture for her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1590355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tendik village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-04-27T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-27T13:40:05Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bermethan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":555,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30203.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947275},{"amount":185,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10067.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578431},{"amount":184.9,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":10067.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.1,"payment_id":595436245}],"funded_date":"2014-05-09T13:32:39Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":702135,"name":"Jackson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackson is a fifty five year old married man living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.

Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Celeste is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nCeleste hopes to expand her business and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1592857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

He resides in Fana City, Commune de Gu\u00e9gn\u00e9ka, in the Banankabougou district with his father in a traditional family. He is a married father of one child. For societal reasons, Mr. Yacouba dropped out of school early in order to get started in revenue-generating businesses. He is currently the owner of a tailoring shop. \r\n\r\nTo diversify his business, he started off in the commerce of sewing supplies, a business he has been operating on his own for eight years. He gets his supplies of merchandise practically each week from suppliers in Bamako. The sales are made retail and in cash in his shop located on the roadside not far from his home. His customer base is composed essentially of tailors.\r\n\r\nThus, to organize his business better, Mr. Yacouba decided to collaborate with the the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his third loan, which will be used to purchase sewing supplies.

Although the price of piglets as well as pig feed is currently expensive, Luh Eka remains passionate for the development of her pig business with the group she leads.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully repaying the previous loan, the Taman Sari group decided to continue the loan and are each getting 1,500,000 IDR.

Now, thanks to her passion for her craft and growing business, in addition to supporting her own family, she employs two other women, thereby enabling them to support their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1592879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy soil, grass and sand for her pottery business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Mozzozzin Norte, Ilagan, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2014-04-27T16:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-27T16:20:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":381.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":384.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":387.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":390.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":393.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":396.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":399.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":402.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":405.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":408.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":411.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":414.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":420.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":423.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":427.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":430.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":433.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":436.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":440.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":443.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":446.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":453.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.98},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.61},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.65,"local_amount":2340,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2352.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479039519},{"amount":36.4,"local_amount":1618,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1626.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490736059},{"amount":37.46,"local_amount":1665,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1674.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504164205},{"amount":98.49,"local_amount":4377,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4401.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530488403}],"funded_date":"2014-04-27T18:15:22Z","paid_date":"2014-09-19T09:13:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":702297,"name":"Deob's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Deob is a 36-year-old a farmer from the province of Battambang province.

She is married to Gregorio, her business partner, and they have children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGina owns and oversees operations of their jeepney* (see footnote) transportation business. She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which has a paying boundary** (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) every day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 11,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.\r\n\r\nGina hopes to have more units of jeepney and dreams that her family is always in good health. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n** In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1592876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

This has given him a very good number of customers, who confirm that he is a friendly man, ready to serve them with a kind smile on his face.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Fabio is applying for economic support to increase his inventory of avocados, buying them for cash and improving his profits.\r\n\r\nHe is separated, but he is the father of three children who occasionally accompany  him and help with his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1588239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more avocados and increase his inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-04-27T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-27T17:20:07Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabio De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71065},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":73036},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75061},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77143},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79283},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81482},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83742},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":86064},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":88451},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":90904},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":93426},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":96017},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":98680},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":101417},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":104229}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.33,"local_amount":173966,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":174243.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856585},{"amount":32.22,"local_amount":62045,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":62144.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504283247},{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":72845,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":72961.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983640},{"amount":514.63,"local_amount":991144,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":992726.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531790277}],"funded_date":"2014-05-25T21:03:54Z","paid_date":"2014-09-25T09:32:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":702311,"name":"Pheap's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pheap is 47 years old and a married mother, blessed with two kids.

She loved the word play and sentiment of greeting cards and was also tired of the same old graphic tees sold by big-box stores, so she decided to create her own lifestyle t-shirt company with unique shirts, made for the lives of everyday people. \r\n\r\nAfter two years in the making, The Write Fit\u2019s online store launched last summer, featuring ten categories of shirts with fun and creative catch-phrases printed on the front. Unique shirt categories like \u2018Soundtrack to Life\u2019, \u2018Ordinary People\u2019 and \u2018Live Write\u2019 are designed to appeal to a wide variety of people with different interests and personalities. \r\n\r\nThe Write Fit provides Joshlyn with the creative expression she\u2019s always wanted in a job. She pulls inspiration from all over, including daily activities and random happenings in her life, Googling every idea to make sure it hasn\u2019t already been done, before putting the slogan on a product of her own. \r\n\r\nMany of the challenges Joshlyn has faced in starting her business has revolved around tracking inventory and knowing how much inventory to produce. This Kiva loan of $3,250 will help Joshlyn to purchase more inventory, set up a tracking system for sales and invest in more marketing for her budding business.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Joshlyn would like to expand locally and start selling at fashion boutiques. She currently runs everything on her own, but wants to eventually hire assistants and seek out interns that have a creative hand to help bring new ideas to the table. Her goal is to set up a creative process that will allow her more time to come up with new designs on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\nCheck out The Write Fit at: http:\/\/shopthewritefit.com

for Jenny and Melissa\u2019s love for all things handmade. After our 18+ years working in corporate jobs that included Netflix and eBay, our vision is to put our collective skill sets together and do something meaningful that would make a difference for both us and others. We believe that everything has value, no matter how damaged it is, and we enjoy giving new life to things that might otherwise be overlooked or thrown away, which as a metaphor, fits our lives perfectly. \r\n\r\nWe are social entrepreneurs who work within the emerging new industrial revolution of Makers\/Do-It-Yourself Micro-Manufacturing. Considered innovators by many, we are utilizing our background in art and design to create inventive ways to repurpose what some call junk into beautiful art, jewelry and home d\u00e9cor products, while enabling ourselves and others to heal during and by this process. \r\n\r\nOur products and market:\r\nWe have developed a number of product lines under the categories of a \u201cGood, Better, Best\u201d pricing structure. This enables us to sell to a varied customer base, with the overarching Junk Girls brand and artist cache attached to each area.\r\n\r\nOur main product under the \u201cGood\u201d category and our primary wholesale line are our metal-stamped products, which make up 40% of our gross revenue. Currently, Melissa hand-stamps words and phrases on recycled and repurposed metals, to include silver-plate, brass and copper. These items are then packaged and sold as necklaces, key rings, cuffs, cheese markers, wedding forks, dangles and charms. \r\n\r\nHow a Kiva loan will help us:\r\nThe manufacturing of our metal-stamped products is created 100% by hand. This is our number one area of growth, with our retailers requesting higher product volume than we can supply. By automating the process, we can build products at least 4-5 times faster to meet the market demand. A Kiva loan will help us with the first round of tools in building the metal stamping automation process.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Zulfiya lives in a village in the Spitamen region. She works with agriculture. She has grown field crops for 5 years already - wheat and rice. Zulfiya sows crops on a plot of land of 2 hectares, which she rents. \r\n\r\nZulfiya is 32 years old. Her husband is a business man and all the children (they have three) go to the village school.

Her husband died a number of years ago, but from this relationship she has six adult children, two of whom still live with her.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Cruz is taking out the loan for a business that she has with her son. They sell fruits, vegetables, and shellfish. Her son goes to the wholesale markets very early in the morning to buy the fruits, vegetables, and fish to then go through the city in his car. Do\u00f1a Cruz also sells from her home to people who live nearby, and with that she earns something for the well being of her family. They have been in business for 9 years, and thanks to this, they are getting ahead.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy fruit, vegetables, and shellfish. She has been in the loan group since its beginning, and she likes it because of the help and benefits that the institution offers them. Her dream is to have a shop in her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":711850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruits, vegetables, and shellfish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-04-27T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-27T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cruz Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1388.16,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":138.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140.01,"local_amount":138.82,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T11:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":140.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479139014},{"amount":280.02,"local_amount":277.64,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":280.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832932},{"amount":280.01,"local_amount":277.64,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":280.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258979},{"amount":280,"local_amount":277.64,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541233},{"amount":419.96,"local_amount":416.42,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":419.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530024427}],"funded_date":"2014-04-29T00:58:27Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T12:08:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":702323,"name":"Luzviminda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luzviminda is a farmer from Oyan, Sibutad.

After that, because there were not many work opportunities in the city where she comes from, she decided to move to a different city and pursue the adventure of a new dream. She started her life over from zero, even though she knew that where she was heading she didn't have anyone close to her, but that was not an impediment for this woman full of dreams. In her suitcases, she packed a little bit of clothing as well as the great ambition to get ahead, to demonstrate that she has what it takes to create a business and succeed in life. With the help of some microloans, she succeeded in establishing a small business selling fruit pulp. She distributes the pulp to various restaurants in the city. In addition, she offers catered meals for all types of events, since it is well-known among her customers that her seasoning has no comparison. Currently, however, she is facing a challenge -- she cannot take on many customers because she doesn't have a lot of equipment for her business, and thus her income level cannot increase. She is working with another person, and together they have a great dream: to establish a venue for special events, which they hope will be a great success.
