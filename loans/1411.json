Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nHelen hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money and modified the jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Filipino.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1592999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

cheerful and hardworking woman of 22. She is married and has one child. Kristina lives with her family in a small town. She doesn't have a higher education; she got married right after graduating from high school. Her husband doesn't have a higher education either; he practises the occupation he learned from his father.\r\n\r\nKristina earns a living as a hairdresser in her own beauty salon. For this she rents a space where her wedding dress rental business is also located. She received a good income from this business. Kristina's husband is currently working in Russia and she wants to increase the number of dresses she has in order to expand her business, since the warm season is beginning, the best time for weddings, and there is a lot of demand for dresses. Therefore she has turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase a large assortment of wedding dresses. Kristina very much hopes for a successful outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1589715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

He hails from Kisii, a region of Kenya known for banana and tea farming, where he lives with his wife and child. For a living, Paul sells milk and food crops from his farm into the local market. He makes extra money engaging in other small businesses to take better care of his small family. He enjoys taking care of his child to free his wife to do domestic chores. \r\n\r\nHis major challenge is going miles downhill to fetch water for domestic and farm use.

He is married and has 4 children, one of whom still lives with him, and the rest of whom are grown and live independently.  He first turned to Arvand when he found out that there was a possibility to receive financial support.  Sattor lives with his family in a rural area.  He has a higher education, but right now is not working in his speciality.  Sattor's wife does not have an education because her family's financial problems precluded her from studying at university.  She is a homemaker and does household chores and raises the children.  In order to have money to take care of his family, Sattor runs his own business fattening and selling cattle.  He receives a good income from this job.

She has the equivalent of a high school education, and works from home as a seamstress, first learning the ropes in her youth and currently earning a good living from it, while her husband works at a local craftsman's workshop.  She's been taking loans through Arvand for several years for personal purchases, and has always paid her loans off on time.

the story of a young student named Laura Nathaly, who has many dreams and goals to achieve and is full of enthusiasm and desire to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe proof of this is that she's studying for a

This was complicated because while she was in 10th grade, she did the first and second semester of this course, so she was studying every day, completely immersed in reading, every day remembering where she wanted to go.\r\n\r\nHer parents supported her a lot, and not only financially. They understand how important the subject of health is for her - not just because it has to do with helping others, but also because she's known since she was little that this is definitively what she wanted to do for the rest of her life and what she wanted to live for.\r\n\r\nBeing in her third semester and in 11th grade, a series of family and economic problems began to develop, worrying this young woman and her family. \r\n\r\nShe thought about postponing the semester and told the institution that it was likely she would not be able to continue this degree for some time. \r\n\r\nThey told her they had an agreement with Kiva, which could offer her financial assistance so she wouldn't have to defer her studies, much less end them.\r\n\r\nThis help serves her and other students, as they can successfully continue with practices, a stage of life in which she's had excellent performance. Finishing high school and a degree provides many reasons to celebrate, as her family feels very proud of her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1589264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-04-28T04:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-28T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura Nathaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":160831.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480202352},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":160831.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286503},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":160831.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225210}],"funded_date":"2014-04-28T06:13:54Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Alexander","image":1669027}},{"id":702564,"name":"Sucheli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sucheli runs a small stall selling mobile phone airtime credits.

clothes. With the loan, she bought bales of clothing from neighboring Mozambique to sell to her local community in rural Zimbabwe.  As these clothes are very affordable, many people in her village flock to purchase clothes from Rusina. This initial increase in sales, made possible through Kiva lending, allowed Rusina to purchase bales more frequently. Rusina is very thankful that the increase in profit has enabled her to pay the school fees for her son and provide basic food and clothing for her family. However, the market place where she sells her clothes has no shelter, so selling clothes during the rainy season is a challenge. In the future, Rusina plans to rent a shop, which will allow her to sell more items. She plans to use the profit to improve her education, send her son to boarding school, and expand into the Pre-School business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1593265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to rent a store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Nyanga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":305,"posted_date":"2014-04-28T04:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-28T04:40:11Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rusina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224321},{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517512521},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529995031},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542486880}],"funded_date":"2014-05-02T19:50:40Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:10:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":702601,"name":"Karine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karine is hardworking farmer from Kirants village. \r\nShe lives there with her husband and three children.

She will buy rice, frijoles, oil, medicine such as ranitidine, panadol and Andrews salts.  She will also buy cosmetic products such as lipstick, nail varnish and perfume for women and men.  These products are those that are in demand in her area.  \r\n\r\nAnother of the members is Silvia, 36, who sells underwear in her community and at the local market.  The other is Carla, 34, who has a fried food stall every weekend with soup every Sunday.   These members do different jobs to earn a living and look after the household.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1589275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He was the second of eight children and due to their high level of poverty he had to help his parents with their work. He is married, and his wife takes care of the household chores.\r\n \r\nManuel works in agriculture, and has done for his whole life, since his father showed him how to do this work when he was a child. Apart from this he also buys and sells livestock, which gives him extra money throughout the year. He does not have normal working hours as it is hard to say with the agriculture job what time he will be able to leave.

It is made up of married women who are relations and neighbours, with an average age of 35 and four children on average.\r\n\r\nThe women run various businesses such as selling produce, like Fatoumata, who is pictured sitting on the far right. They live in large traditional families in N'tentou, in the Kati prefecture (Koulikoro region,  Mali). They have been running their businesses for several years and are highly sought after for the produce they sell: tomatoes, cabbages and pepper.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy growing customer demand, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan programme a year ago. This is their second solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nFatoumata, a member of the group and very well-known in N'tentou, is good at selling produce. She will use her loan to buy a large quantity of different types of produce (tomatoes, cabbages and pepper). She buys her supplies in Bamako and directly from wholesalers and sells them to male and female customers in Ouelessebougou, for cash and on credit.\r\n\r\nFatoumata hopes to make 15,000 CFA francs a month, which will allow her to repay the loan and reinvest in her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1591372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She would also love to further her education and pursue a degree in humanitarian studies so that she can work with communities on a professional level. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1593370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase electrical goods to add to her stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Gokwe North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":305,"posted_date":"2014-04-28T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-28T14:20:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504224326},{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517512526},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542486885}],"funded_date":"2014-05-11T19:15:05Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:10:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":702654,"name":"Dudzai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"When Dudzai applied for a Kiva loan she was running a salon business, however she later discovered that she can make a lot more money by selling goats and cows which is a very profitable business in Muzarabani, Zimbabwe.

Due to the fact that the village has a mountainous terrain, planting activity is something that doesn\u2019t go well with it. However, livestock is the practice that villagers pursue the most. \r\n\r\nBedri\u2019s village is known for having tens of hundreds of chestnut trees and selling large quantities of such nuts in the Albanian market. The traditional food here is dried beans with homemade bacon.

Before acquiring the Kiva loan, she rented a store at the local business center. She later decided that owning her own shop was preferable, so she enlisted the help of her brother and they built the shop she is currently using with part of the Kiva loan and used the rest of the loan to purchase clothes for her stock.  \r\n\r\nFrom the research she carried out, Ireen discovered that people were not as interested in buying clothes as she initially thought. To address this she began stocking her shop with food items such as sugar, cooking oil, and rice. She found that when people come to buy these food items, they also end up looking at the clothes as well. Because of this strategic marketing, Ireen has been able to increase her client base and improve her standard of living. \r\n\r\nShe aspires to purchase a wider variety of things to sell in her shop and increase her client base further. She is also managing to feed her family, buy good clothes for herself and her child, and take care of her sick sister.

She is 45 years old and lives in Waterloo western rural area in Freetown. She is married with 4 children. During the past 20 years, Fatmata established her retail business.

At a very young age\u2014she was only 20 years old\u2014she decided to get married.  In the course of her marriage, she managed to open a shop selling clothing and a variety of articles such as lotions and deodorants.  Her work was made lighter by the help of her husband.  \r\n\r\nShe currently has an acceptable volume of sales.  Because of this, Maritza has a big dream of building a sturdy house with her own efforts, sweat, and sacrifice.  Maritza says that she doesn\u2019t want anyone to help her with this project because when she got married she got lots of comments that she was only getting married for her own benefit.  She wants to demonstrate the opposite: that she doesn\u2019t need anyone in order to reach her goals.  \r\n\r\nThe micro-loan will be used to update her shop and make it pleasing and attractive, because like any woman she likes to have her business decorated and pretty.  With these updates she hopes to attract customers and be able to generate a better income in order to achieve her previously mentioned dreams.

He has done this work in recent years to support his family, which consists of his wife and his 4-year old son.

The idea came out of a need, as with what he was earning from his security job, he wasn't covering all of the household expenses or meeting the needs of his nuclear family.  He started the hardware business on his own without the help of any family members or friends.  Only his wishes and desire to have a better income brought Jorge to selling said products.

John runs this business primarily to help with his university expenses.  It is very clear to him that education is the best way to get out of poverty and the only way to improve his situation and contribute something to his country.  John is a very studious person with a promising future.  As his sales project advanced, more needs came up; John's family needed him to contribute to the household expenses.

One of the area's geographic characteristics is the scattered territory, which impedes easy access to the different communities, and makes communication between them difficult.  The main economic activities of the residents are agriculture and raising animals.  Many also go to the city to work in different activities.  They still maintain the culture and traditions of their villages.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Mar\u00eda.  This is the sixth loan that she has obtained alongside her friends with whom she shares great moments.  They help her to get ahead with their advise and support.  The loans help her to improve her business and the stability of her home.  Mar\u00eda is 44 years old, married and has conceived 7 children.  Two of her children help with the household work, two are in high school, and three are in the local primary school.  Her husband works as a mason, and they own the home that they live in.  Since she lives in the country, Mar\u00eda devotes herself to raising cattle, guinea pigs, chickens, and sheep, as well as agriculture.  She sells what she harvests or she uses it at home.\r\n\r\nThe money from the loan will be used to purchase chickens, guinea pigs, and animal feed.  Her goal is to have more high quality animals.
